25|$|This {{changed with}} the {{introduction}} of Buddhism, where Buddhism both adopted traditional practices and vice versa. This included the change of the afterlife, which gained a heaven, hell and different levels of <b>hell</b> <b>with</b> it sometime in the 4th-fifth century.

25|$|Sanders {{has also}} written on the variety of views Christians affirm {{on the nature of}} <b>hell</b> <b>with</b> special {{attention}} given to how divine love and justice are understood. Though some Christians understand suffering in hell to be literal, others conceive it as annihilation or that hell is temporary until all turn to God. He edited a collection on violence in relation to the atonement.|$|E
25|$|Zimbardo's book, The Lucifer Effect, {{gets its}} title from the {{metamorphosis}} of Lucifer into Satan. Though the Christian Scriptures {{do not make}} this claim, according to the Biblical account, Lucifer was once God's favorite angel until he challenged God's authority and was cast into <b>Hell</b> <b>with</b> all the other fallen angels. Thus, Zimbardo derives this title to explain how good people turn evil. Zimbardo's main assumption on why good people do terrible things is due to situational influences and power given from authority.|$|E

25|$|Bring Me the Horizon {{then moved}} even {{further away from}} deathcore in their third album There Is a <b>Hell,</b> <b>with</b> the {{incorporation}} of electronica, classical music and pop into their metalcore style. This required more ambitious production feats, such as using a full choir, a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns (that were also toned down, favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks). For the writing of Sempiternal, the band pooled far broader influences such as post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky and from pop music.|$|E
25|$|Vanir {{was one of}} the Devil King's generals who ends {{up taking}} over the {{management}} of Wiz's magic shop. He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of <b>hell,</b> <b>with</b> the ability to read everything about anybody, but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people who are a little weaker than him; these people have their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him hard to read. He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The <b>hell</b> <b>with</b> you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
