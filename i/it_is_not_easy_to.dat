5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps {{have been used to}} monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, {{not so much a}} logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{assess the}} {{importance}} of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little hinterland. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were {{an essential part of the}} Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.|$|E
25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although agreeable people can be less disruptive in teams {{and are more likely}} to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers. Less agreeable people tend to make more effective managers, perhaps because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of them.|$|E

25|$|A major {{challenge}} for medical training programs is recruitment of GTAs and MUTAs. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find potential teaching assistants who are healthy, {{are capable of}} instructing students well, and are comfortable with having their breasts or genital areas palpated by medical students.

Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for {{a place in the}} guild anyway.|$|E
25|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{is due to}} {{the complexity}} of plasma processes. Because of the complexity <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> achieve a good control over the chemical composition of the surface after modification. The influence of process parameters on the chemical composition of the resultant polymer means it can {{take a long time to}} determine the optimal conditions. The complexity of the process also makes it impossible to theorize what the resultant polymer will look like, unlike conventional polymers which can be easily determined based on the monomer.|$|E

25|$|The use of spheres {{is often}} for convenience, being limited both by {{graphics}} libraries and the additional effort required to compute complete electronic density or other space-filling quantities. It is now relatively common to see images of surfaces {{that have been}} colored to show quantities such as electrostatic potential. Common surfaces in molecular visualization include solvent-accessible ("Lee-Richards") surfaces, solvent-excluded ("Connolly") surfaces, and isosurfaces. The isosurface in Fig. 5 appears to show the electrostatic potential, with blue colors being negative and red/yellow (near the metal) positive (there is no absolute convention of coloring, and red/positive, blue/negative are often reversed). Opaque isosurfaces do not allow the atoms {{to be seen and}} identified and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> deduce them. Because of this, isosurfaces are often drawn with a degree of transparency.|$|E
25|$|A {{supernova}} is {{a transient}} astronomical event that occurs {{during the last}} stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. This explosion can happen in one of many ways, but {{in all of them}} a significant proportion of the matter in the star is blown away into the surrounding space at extremely high velocities (up to 10% of the speed of light). Unless there is perfect spherical symmetry in these explosions (i.e., unless matter is spewed out evenly in all directions), there will be gravitational radiation from the explosion. This is because gravitational waves are generated by a changing quadrupole moment, which can happen only when there is asymmetrical movement of masses. Since the exact mechanism by which supernovae take place is not fully understood, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> model the gravitational radiation emitted by them.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen metres north {{there was}} another square {{enclosure}} (17 x 17 metres) dedicated to Zeus Meilichios (Honey-sweet Zeus) and Pasikrateia (Persephone), much of which remains, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> understand the various structures, which were built {{at the end of}} the fourth century BC. It consists of an enclosure wall surrounded by various types of column on two sides (part of a Hellenistic portico), a small prostyle temple in antis (5.22 x 3.02m) at the back of the enclosure with monolithic Doric columns, but an ionic entablature, and two others in the centre of the enclosure. Outside, to the west, the pious dedicated many small steles topped by images of the divine pair (two faces, one male and one female) made with shallow incisions. Along with them were found ashes and remains of offerings, evidence of convergence between the Greek cult of the Chthonic gods and Punic religion.|$|E

25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E
25|$|The crags of Dove Crag are the fell's finest feature. The crag {{is about}} 75 metres high {{at its highest}} point and is a popular venue for rock climbers with classic routes such as Extol and Fast and Furious. Lately it has become used by boulderers with several top-class climbs such as Impailed and Pail Attitude on the {{boulders}} that have become detached from the main crag. Concealed within the crags is the “Priest's Hole”. This is a cave, roughly about five metres deep with extra protection provided by a wall built in front, which is often used by walkers and climbers as a rough overnight camp. It is well used and stocked (even having a visitors' book) but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find in bad conditions. It is marked on the large-scale Ordnance Survey maps but this is only of limited use. It is not mentioned by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, which suggests {{that he did not}} know of its existence.

25|$|At Stretton-on-Fosse II (Warwickshire), {{located on}} the western fringes of the early Anglo-Saxon {{settlement}} area, the proportion of male adults with weapons is 82%, well above the average in southern England. Cemetery II, the Anglo-Saxon burial site, is immediately adjacent to two Romano-British cemeteries, Stretton-on-Fosse I and III, the latter only 60 metres away from Anglo-Saxon burials. Continuity of the native female population at this site has been inferred from the continuity of textile techniques (unusual in {{the transition from the}} Romano-British to the Anglo-Saxon periods), and by the continuity of epigenetic traits from the Roman to the Anglo-Saxon burials. At the same time, the skeletal evidence demonstrates the appearance in the post-Roman period of a new physical type of males who are more slender and taller than the men in the adjacent Romano-British cemeteries. Taken together, the observations suggest the influx of a group of males, probably most or all of them Germanic, who took control of the local community and married native women. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> confirm such cases of 'warband' settlement in the absence of detailed skeletal, and other complementary, information, but assuming that such cases are indicated by very high proportions of weapon burials, this type of settlement was much less frequent than the kin group model.|$|E
