40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the long term histopathologic changes in tracheal mucosa after a total laryngectomy, and to find out the relationship between the progression of histopathologic changes in tracheal mucosa and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> through the tracheostomy. Tracheal mucosal biopsies were taken from a total of 35 patients, of both sexes, who underwent a total laryngectomy for laryngeal carcinoma at least one year prior. Histologic specimens of tracheal mucosa were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under light microscopy. Almost all of the patients demonstrated histopathologic changes or abnormalities. Based on the results, histological findings were grouped into seven categories: normal respiratory epithelium, mild, moderate and advanced basal cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and slight and moderate and dysplasia. The time elapsed since surgery was calculated for each histopathological change separately. In laryngeal carcinoma patients, after a total laryngectomy histopathologic changes occur in tracheal mucosa.

40|$|Do gaseous {{micronuclei}} {{trigger the}} formation of bubbles in decompression sickness (DCS) ? Most previous instructions for DCS prevention have been oriented toward supersaturated gas in tissue. We are developing a mathematical model that is oriented toward the expected behavior of micronuclei. The issue is simplified in altitude decompressions because the aviator or astronaut is exposed only to decompression, whereas in diving there is a compression before the decompression. The model deals with four variables: <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> of 100 % oxygen before going to altitude (O 2 prebreathing), altitude of the exposure, exposure duration, and rate of ascent. Assumptions: a) there is a population of micronuclei of various sizes having a range of characteristics, b) micronuclei are stable until they grow to a certain critical nucleation radius, c) it takes time for gas to diffuse {{in or out of}} micronuclei, and d) all other variables being equal, growth of micronuclei upon decompression is more rapid at high altitude because of the rarified gas in the micronuclei. To estimate parameters, we use a dataset of 4, 756 men in altitude chambers exposed to various combinations of the model s variables. The model predicts occurrence of DCS symptoms quite well. It is notable that both the altitude chamber data and the model show little effect of O 2 prebreathing until it lasts more than 60 minutes; this is in contrast to a conventional idea that the benefit of prebreathing is directly due to exponential washout of tissue nitrogen. The delay in response to O 2 prebreathing can be interpreted as time required for outward diffusion of nitrogen; when the micronuclei become small enough, they are disabled, either by crushing or because they cannot expand to a critical nucleation size when the subject ascends to altitude...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Our {{project was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the effect}} of time of day on multiple mechanisms influencing breathing stability and respiratory plasticity. We investigated if the number and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> events coupled to upper airway collapsibility, as well as the carbon dioxide reserve, chemoreflex sensitivity and arousal threshold during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were affected by the time of day. In addition, we examined if mild intermittent hypoxia (IH) initiates long-term facilitation of upper airway muscle activity leading to a reduction in the therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure required to eliminate breathing events. Methods: Male participants with obstructive sleep apnea completed a constant routine protocol that consisted of sleep sessions in the evening (10 PM to 1 AM), morning (6 AM to 9 AM), and afternoon (2 PM to 5 PM). On one occasion the number and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> events was ascertained for each sleep session. For breathing events detected during these sessions the rate of change of respiratory effort, maximum respiratory effort immediately prior to termination of an event, and the maximum tidal volume and the minimum partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO 2) immediately following an event were measured Participants then completed the same protocol on two additional occasions, where the critical closing pressure that demarcated upper airway collapsibility was determined on one, and baseline levels of carbon dioxide PET(CO 2) and minute ventilation, as well as the PET(CO 2) that demarcated the apneic threshold and hypocapnic ventilatory response were measured on the other (the order of these 2 visits was randomized). In the second aim of the study, male participants with obstructive sleep apnea were treated with twelve 2 -minute episodes of hypoxia (PETO 2 ≈ 50 mmHg) separated by 2 -minute intervals of normoxia in the presence of PETCO 2 that was sustained 3 mmHg above baseline. During recovery from the last episode the positive airway pressure was reduced in a step-wise fashion until flow limitation was evident. The participants also completed a sham protocol under normocapnic conditions, which mimicked the timeframe of the IH protocol. Results: The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> events was consistently greater in the morning compared with the evening and afternoon during N 1 and N 2, while an increase in event frequency was evident during N 1. The critical closing pressure was increased in the morning (2. 68 ± 0. 98 cmH 2 O) compared with the evening (1. 29 ± 0. 91 cmH 2 O; P ≤ 0. 02) and afternoon (1. 25 ± 0. 79; P ≤ 0. 01). The increase in the critical closing pressure was correlated to the decrease in the baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the morning compared with the afternoon and evening (r = − 0. 73, P ≤ 0. 005) [...] The nadir of core body temperature during sleep occurred in the morning and was accompanied by reductions in minute ventilation and PETCO 2 compared with the evening and afternoon (minute ventilation: 5. 3 ± 0. 3 vs. 6. 2 ± 0. 2 vs. 6. 1 ± 0. 2 l/min, P lt; 0. 02; PET(CO 2) : 39. 7 ± 0. 4 vs. 41. 4 ± 0. 6 vs. 40. 4 ± 0. 6 Torr, P 3 ̆c 0. 02). The carbon dioxide reserve was reduced, and the hypocapnic ventilatory response increased in the morning compared with the evening and afternoon (carbon dioxide reserve: 2. 1 ± 0. 3 vs. 3. 6 ± 0. 5 vs. 3. 5 ± 0. 3 Torr, P 3 ̆c 0. 002; hypocapnic ventilatory response: 2. 3 ± 0. 3 vs. 1. 6 ± 0. 2 vs. 1. 8 ± 0. 2 l·min(- 1) ·mmHg(- 1), P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The rate of change of respiratory effort was similar in N 2 compared to N 1 but the maximum respiratory effort immediately prior to event termination was greater (- 10. 7 ± 1. 2 vs. - 9. 6 ± 1. 0 cmH 2 O/s, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Likewise, tidal volume was increased (1169 ± 105 vs. 1082 ± 100 ml, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and PETCO 2 was decreased (37. 0 ± 0. 8 vs. 37. 7 ± 0. 8 mmHg P 3 ̆c 0. 05) following events in N 2 compared to N 1. A similar tidal volume and PETCO 2 response was evident following events in the morning compared to the evening independent of sleep stage. After exposure to IH the therapeutic pressure was significantly reduced (Δ CPAP = - 4. 95 ± 0. 5 cmH 2 O, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) without evidence of flow limitation (P 3 ̆e 0. 2) or increases in upper airway resistance (P 3 ̆e 0. 4). In contrast, a similar decrease in pressure was accompanied by significant flow limitation (P 3 ̆c 0. 003) and an increase in upper airway resistance (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) following completion of the sham protocol. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that time of day affects the duration and frequency of events, coupled with alterations in upper airway collapsibility and chemoreflex properties during sleep, which may contribute to increases in breathing instability in the morning compared with other periods throughout the day/night cycle in individuals with sleep apnea. We propose that increases in airway collapsibility in the morning may be linked to an endogenous modulation of baseline carbon dioxide levels and chemoreflex sensitivity, which are independent of the consequences of sleep apnea. We also conclude that alterations in the arousal threshold, reflected by an increase in respiratory effort at event termination, coupled to increases in tidal volume and reductions in PETCO 2 contribute to modifications in event duration and frequency associated with variations in sleep state or time of night. In addition, Exposure to IH decreases the therapeutic pressure required to eliminate apneic events which could improve treatment compliance. This possibility coupled with the direct beneficial effects of IH on co-morbidities linked to sleep apnea suggests that IH may have a multipronged therapeutic effect on sleep apnea...|$|E
40|$|Background: Continuous {{positive}} airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are {{two ways}} of noninvasive breathing support. Both give a continuous pressure, but NIPPV also supports every breath. Therefore NIPPV {{may be a better}} support, but may also cause more complications, because NIPPV blows more air into the lungs and stomach. It is important to determine the balance between effectiveness and complications between NIPPV and CPAP in preterm born infants in the NICU of a single participating center. Objective: In anticipation the results of an international trial, we aimed to investigate the differences between effectiveness and complications between the use of NIPPV and CPAP as a treatment method for preterm born infants in a single medical center. We formulated death or BPD as the primary outcome, and we formulated several secondary outcomes, such as the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> support (effectiveness) and gastrointestinal problems (complications). Methods: We included preterm born infants < 30 wk GA and < 1000 gram at birth, hospitalized at the NICU at the UMCG. They were treated with either NIPPV or CPAP, their treatment was decided by randomization. We compared both groups by comparing their differences between their effectiveness and complications. Results: 32 infants were included, 17 randomised to NIPPV and 15 to CPAP. Median gestational age (GA) of the NIPPV-group was 271 weeks (250 - 291) birth weight 840 grams (570 - 1000), median GA of the CPAP-group was 280 weeks (25 - 296) birth weight 900 grams (600 - 995). 29 % of the infants in the NIPPV-group either died, developed BPD or both, against 47 % of the CPAP-group (p= 0. 47). No differences were found in other respiratory outcomes, such as number of reintubations (7 (42 %) versus 6 (40 %) p= 1. 0) and duration of respiratory support (53 versus 40 days (p= 0. 407)). Gastrointestinal complications such as occurrence of NEC (4 (24 %) versus 4 (27 %) p= 1. 0) and growth (151 versus 152 g/wk (p= 0. 845) also showed no differences. Conclusions: No differences were found in effectiveness and complications when NIPPV is compared to CPAP. In anticipation {{of the results of the}} international trial, we found no differences in this small group of infants in a single participating center. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: For percutaneously tracheostomized {{patients}} with prolonged weaning and persisting respiratory failure, the adequate time point for safe decannulation and switch to noninvasive ventilation {{is an important}} clinical issue. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a tracheostomy retainer (TR) and the predictors of successful decannulation. Methods: We studied 166 of 384 {{patients with}} prolonged weaning in whom a TR was inserted into a tracheostoma. Patients were analyzed with regard to successful decannulation and characterized by blood gas values, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> previous spontaneous <b>breathing,</b> Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and laboratory parameters. Results: In 47 patients (28. 3 %) recannulation was necessary, mostly due to respiratory decompensation and aspiration. Overall, 80. 6 % of the patients could be liberated from a tracheostomy {{with the help of}} a TR. The need for recannulation was associated with a shorter <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> within the last 24 / 48 h (p < 0. 01 each), lower arterial oxygen tension (p = 0. 025), greater age (p = 0. 025), and a higher creatinine level (p = 0. 003) and SAPS (p < 0. 001). The risk for recannulation was 9. 5 % when patients breathed spontaneously for 19 - 24 h within the 24 h prior to decannulation, but 75. 0 % when patients breathed for only 0 - 6 h without ventilatory support (p < 0. 001). According to ROC analysis, the SAPS best predicted successful decannulation {[}AUC 0. 725 (95 % CI: 0. 634 - 0. 815), p < 0. 001]. Recannulated patients had longer <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> intubation (p = 0. 046), tracheostomy (p = 0. 003) and hospital stay (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: In percutaneously tracheostomized patients with prolonged weaning, the use of a TR seems to facilitate and improve the weaning process considerably. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> prior to decannulation, age and oxygenation describe the risk for recannulation in these patients. Copyright (c) 2012 S.

40|$|Exhibition Statement: Lesley Punton and Judy Spark share {{a concern}} in their {{attempts}} to bridge a certain sort of gap; that of the difference between the physical experience of specific varieties of ‘natural’ phenomena or places, and their articulation in human terms. Both feel the impossibility attached to this problem, but nonetheless remain dedicated to its resolution through the making of art. For these two artists, the making of an artwork is a process of interrogating lived experience and it is the language used to express this search, which is also a quest for other varieties of understanding, alternative ways of knowing the world. The question of whether such alternative interpretations are subjective or in some way universal is inherent to the work. The processes of Punton and Spark sustain common patterns; periods of concentrated engagement with objects and places of interest, an awareness during such engagement, of <b>duration,</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> of scale, and working methods which mirror these physical experiences; an almost meditative approach to drawing for example. The results stand as evidence of the inquiry, the process itself is what is important. The bodily experience of phenomena is reflected in the consideration of how, and for how long, the viewer physically encounters the work, which is ‘quiet’ and aims to draw the viewer into a contemplative ‘space’ in which they might imagine, or consider, their own process of engagement with ‘the things themselves. ’ Having recognised the similarities between their working practices, the two artists have begun to pay close attention to their contrasting approaches to the pursuit of an idea; Punton’s is deeply experiential, entirely dependent upon the measured contact of her feet with the ground of the remote environments she craves. Spark however, despite a natural bent towards phenomenological thinking and certain Eastern approaches to the natural world, feels unable to completely suspend her embeddedness within technologically bound western culture, for her a revised understanding of one, can only impact the other. From the dialogue generated by these commonalities of practice, as well as their disjuncture, these artists attempt to probe the gaps between experience, whether natural or technological, and its articulation, with the hope of uncovering the fertile ground of potential new understandings. The resulting work takes the form of drawings, photography and recorded sound.

40|$|Other {{than the}} martial component, the primary concern {{for many of}} the martial arts is {{answering}} the question, "what is self?". The task of answering that question has historically belonged to the martial arts {{to the extent that they}} both came out of Buddhist schools of thought. For many of the martial arts self knowledge is one of the principle components. Both Buddhism and Taoism talk about a 'way' of the world, which is also the 'way' of self. Self is the same for everyone as all beings are cut from the same cloth of self. When one asks the question "what is self?", it is quite surmising to hear that self has no inherent features. We have all heard the Buddhist claim that 'all is void', and will probably be more surprised to discover that this means that there is in fact no self at all. The significance of this is revealed when one experiences that the nature of all things is change. This is why there are no features to self, as soon as one defines self, that limited definition falls away and is replaced by a new one. The discovery of this is not as efacing as it may seem, as it offers in exchange for a fixed self, one that can accommodate all things. It is void that permits the presence of things. According to Buddhist thought, all suffering arises from the desire to have things remain the same. Accepting that they won't or can't liberates the self to the enjoyment of being in present time. The immediacy and inherent meaning in all things becomes infinitely available. Within change it is evident that all things are continuous, without distinction one from the other. In every sense, self belongs to the greater body of all existence. In martial arts the practice of meditation is essential. The first lesson of meditation is often to simply observe ones breath. In the observation of the full <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> the constancy of change becomes apparentand the experiencing of the exclusive truth of now is layed bare. In the performance of martial arts this is vital. As soon as the artists mind stops or fixes in a particular moment, fear may enter, or she may rely on thought rather than being to perform and thus lose the fluidity of free action and become victim to defeat. If in the design of a martial arts academy it was the intention of the architecture to provide evidence of change, it would not be necessary to create change because change is happening at all times and in all places. It may only be necessary to call attention to it. In tracing the lines of overflow of the Rio-Grande River for the course of forty recorded years, I reaffirmed the truth of change. While examining the discrepancy between and among each line I could not find the defining line of the river. I wanted to build th is into the architecture, and so this became my thesis. by Connie J.

The muscle samples from the patients, and especially those from the palatopharyngeus, showed several morphological abnormalities. The most striking findings were (i) increased amount of connective tissue, (ii) abnormal variability in fibre size, (iii) increased proportion of small-sized fibres, (iv) alterations in fibre type and MyHC compositions, (v) increased frequency of fibres containing developmental MyHC isoforms. Our findings point towards a pathological process of denervation and degeneration in the patient samples.

ParticipantsAdults over 16 years of age receiving mechanical ventilation. InterventionInspiratory muscle training versus sham or no inspiratory muscle training. Outcome measuresData were extracted regarding inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> unassisted <b>breathing</b> periods, weaning success and duration, reintubation and tracheostomy, survival, adverse effects, and length of stay. ResultsThree studies involving 150 participants {{were included in the}} review. The studies varied in time to commencement of the training, the device used, the training protocol, and the outcomes measured. Inspiratory muscle training significantly increased inspiratory muscle strength over sham or no training (weighted mean difference 8 cmH 2 O, 95 % CI 6 to 9). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in weaning success or duration, survival, reintubation, or tracheostomy. ConclusionInspiratory muscle training was found to significantly increase inspiratory muscle strength in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation. Despite data from a substantial pooled cohort, it is not yet clear whether the increase in inspiratory muscle strength leads to a shorter <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> mechanical ventilation, improved weaning success, or improved survival.

40|$|Chronically {{critically}} ill patients often undergo prolonged mechanical ventilation. The role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) during weaning {{of these patients}} remains unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the value of NIV and whether a parameter can predict the need for NIV in chronically {{critically ill}} patients during the weaning process. We conducted a prospective study that included chronically critically ill patients admitted to Spanish respiratory care units. The weaning method used consisted of progressive periods <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> trials. Patients were transferred to NIV when it proved impossible to increase the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> trials beyond 18  h. 231 chronically critically ill patients were included in the study. 198 (85. 71 %) patients achieved weaning success (mean weaning time 25. 45 ± 16. 71  days), of whom 40 (21. 4 %) needed NIV during the weaning process. The variable which predicted the need for NIV was arterial carbon dioxide tension at respiratory care unit admission (OR 1. 08 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 15), p= 0. 013), with a cut-off point of 45. 5  mmHg (sensitivity 0. 76, specificity 0. 67, positive predictive value 0. 76, negative predictive value 0. 97). NIV is a useful tool during weaning in chronically critically ill patients.

40|$|Purpose :To compare various {{recovery}} {{quality of}} sevoflurane and desflurane in elderly patients underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy, {{and to provide}} a reliable basis for anesthesiologists to choose anesthesia maintaining drugs. Method :Sixty elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy were selected from October, 2015 to May, 2016, and were divided into two groups by random number table, namely, the group of Dofetilide (group D) 30 cases, and sevoflurane (group S) 30 cases. The time of spontaneous respiration, the time of eye opening, the time of extubation and the time of awakening were recorded respectively in two groups. The incidence of nausea, vomiting and restlessness were also recorded. Result:There is no statistical difference comparing data of two groups. The time of spontaneous respiration, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing,</b> the time <b>of</b> conscious recovery, the time of extubation and the time of leaving the room were shorter in group D than in group S, the difference was statistically significant (P 0. 05). Conclusion :Compared with sevoflurane, desflurane can reduce the extubation and awakening time, improve the quality of awakening and speed up the turnover of surgery, and it has certain clinical application advantage for thoracoscopic lobectomy in elderly patients...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recorded lung and tumor respiratory motion with X-ray camera, in five patients with lung cancer as well as in five experimental dogs. We made random observation <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> cycle inhalation dura-tion, exhalation duration, and inhalation to exha-lation conversion within each lung cancer pa-tients and within each of the five animals. RESULTS: Respiratory inhalation <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> each dog and human> exhalation duration> ex-hale to inhale conversion length> inhalation to exhalation conversion length. During the four breathing cycles, the total respiratory duration differs, and the length <b>of</b> the same <b>breathing</b> phase is inconsistent.

40|$|This {{communication}} extends {{a statistical}} analysis of forced-descent decompression sickness at altitude in exercising subjects (J Appl Physiol 1994; 76 : 2726 - 2734) with a data subset having an additional explanatory variable, rate of ascent. The original explanatory variables for risk-function analysis were environmental pressure <b>of</b> the altitude, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> exposure, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> pure-O 2 <b>breathing</b> before exposure; the best fit {{was consistent with the}} idea that instantaneous risk increases linearly as altitude exposure continues. Use of the new explanatory variable improved the fit of the smaller data subset, as indicated by log likelihood. Also, with ascent rate accounted for, replacement of the term for linear accrual of instantaneous risk by a term for rise and then decay made a highly significant improvement upon the original model (log likelihood increased by 37 log units). The authors conclude that a more representative data set and removal of the variability attributable to ascent rate allowed the rise-and-decay mechanism, which is expected from theory and observations, to become manifest...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic {{ventilatory}} instabilities {{are widely}} attributed {{to an increase}} in the sensitivity or loop gain of the chemoreflex feedback loop controlling ventilation. A major limitation in the conventional characterization of this feedback loop is the need for labor-intensive methodologies. To overcome this limitation, we developed a method based on trivariate autoregressive modeling using ventilation, end-tidal Pco 2 and Po 2; this method provides for estimation of the overall “loop gain” of the respiratory control system and its components, chemoreflex gain and plant gain. Our method was applied to recordings <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> in 15 anesthetized, tracheostomized, newborn lambs before and after administration of domperidone (a dopamine D 2 -receptor antagonist that increases carotid body sensitivity). We quantified the known increase in hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity in response to domperidone; controller gain for O 2 increased from 0. 06 (0. 03, 0. 09) l·min− 1 ·mmHg− 1 to 0. 09 (0. 08, 0. 13) l·min− 1 ·mmHg− 1; median (interquartile-range). We also report that domperidone increased the loop gain of the control system more than twofold [0. 14 (0. 12, 0. 22) to 0. 40 (0. 15, 0. 57) ]. We observed no significant changes in CO 2 controller gain, or plant gains for O 2 and CO 2. Furthermore, our estimate <b>of</b> the cycle <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> periodic <b>breathing</b> compared favorably with that observed experimentally [measured: 7. 5 (7. 2, 9. 1) vs. predicted: 7. 9 (7. 0, 9. 2) breaths]. Our results demonstrate that model-based analysis <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> can 1) characterize the dynamics of the respiratory control system, and 2) provide a simple tool for elucidating an individual's propensity for ventilatory instability, in turn allowing potential therapies to be directed at the underlying mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that auditory rhythms affect both movement and physiological functions.

To address this question, we monitored the breath <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> participants exposed to three conditions: (a) ecological sounds <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> (b) artificial sounds <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> having equal temporal features as the ecological sounds, (c) no sounds (control). We found that participants’ breath duration variability was reduced in the ecological sound condition, more than in the artificial sound condition.

We interpreted our results according to the Theory of Event Coding, providing further support to its validity, and suggesting its possible extension in the domain of physiological functions which are both consciously and unconsciously controlled...|$|R
