Some have reported improved packaging methods to deal with such complications. Body packing is an on-going drug smuggling method and authorities across the world are always on the alert. Case Presentation: It has reported a case of death due to the effects of heroin concealed in a man who was attempting to smuggle the drug within his gastro-intestinal track. According to forensic procedure of sudden unnatural death, the decedent had to accept a series of examination such as CT scan, autopsy and toxicological analysis. He was found dead from acute heroin intoxication due to the rupture of drug packet in the stomach.

40|$|AbstractSolar cell {{performance}} decreases with increasing temperature, fundamentally owing to increased <b>internal</b> <b>carrier</b> recombination rates, caused by increased carrier concentrations. The operating temperature {{plays a key}} role in the photovoltaic conversion process. Both the electrical efficiency and the power output of a photovoltaic (PV) module depend linearly on the operating temperature. The various correlations proposed in the literature represent simplified working equations which can be apply to PV modules or PV arrays mounted on free-standing frames, PV-Thermal collectors, and building integrated photovoltaic arrays, respectively. The electrical performance is primarily influenced by the material of PV used. Numerous correlations for cell temperature which have appeared in the literature involve basic environmental variables and numerical parameters which are material or system dependent. In this paper, a brief discussion is presented regarding the operating temperature of one-sun commercial grade silicon- based solar cells/modules and its effect upon the electrical performance of photovoltaic installations. Generally, the performance ratio decreases with latitude because of temperature. However, regions with high altitude have higher performance ratios due to low temperature, like, southern Andes, Himalaya region, and Antarctica. PV modules with less sensitivity to temperature are preferable for the high temperature regions and more responsive to temperature will be more effective in the low temperature regions.

Unlike 0 D and 1 D nanostructures, such as quantum dots and nanowires, respectively, 2 D structures, such as nanomembranes, are unrivalled in their scalability for high yield manufacture and are less challenging in handling with the current transfer techniques. Furthermore, due to their planar geometry, nanomembranes are compatible with the current {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology. Due to these superior characteristics, there are currently different techniques in exfoliating nanomembranes with different crystallinities, thicknesses and compositions. In this work we demonstrate a new facile technique of exfoliating gallium nitride (GaN) nanomembranes with novel features, namely with the non-radiative cores of their threading-dislocations (TDs) being etched away. The exfoliation process is based on engineering the gallium vacancy (VGa) density during the GaN epitaxial growth with subsequent preferential etching. Based on scanning and transmission electron microscopies, as well as micro-photoluminescence measurements, a model is proposed to uncover the physical processes underlying the formation of the nanomembranes. Raman measurements are also performed to reveal the internal strain within the nanomembranes. After transferring these freely suspended 25 nm thin GaN nanomembranes to other substrates, we demonstrate the temperature dependence of their bandgap by photoluminescence technique, in order to shed light on the <b>internal</b> <b>carrier</b> dynamics. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The optical properties of various multilayer quantum cascade laser waveguides are investigated by solving Maxwell’s equations using a transfer-matrix method.

A Caughey-Thomas-like mobility model is used to estimate the temperature dependence of the electron mobility which is found to {{have a significant effect on}} the optical waveguide properties. The incorporation of this effect leads to better agreement with experimentally measured threshold current densities. In order to investigate the thermal properties of QCLs, a multi-dimensional anisotropic heat diffusion model is developed which includes temperature-dependent material parameters. The model is developed using finite-difference methods in such a way that is can be solved in both the time-domain and in the steady-state.

40|$|Fringe {{projection}} is {{an important}} technology for the measurement of free form elements in several application fields. It {{can be applied to}} measure geometry elements smaller than one millimeter. In combination with deviation analysis algorithms, errors in fabrication lines can be found promptly to minimize rejections. However, some fields cannot be covered by the classical fringe projection approach. Due to shadowing, filigree form elements on narrow or <b>internal</b> <b>carrier</b> geometries cannot be captured. To overcome this limitation, a fiberscopic micro fringe projection sensor was developed [1]. The new device is capable of resolutions of less than 15 m with uncertainties of about 35 m in a workspace of 3 x 3 x 3 mm. Using standard phase measurement techniques, such as Gray-code and cos-patterns, measurement times of over a second are too long for in-situ operation. The following work will introduce an approach of applying a new single image measuring method to the fiberscopic system, based on inverse fringe projection [2]. The fiberscopic fringe projection system employs a laser light source in combination with a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) to generate fringe patterns. Fiber optical image bundles (FOIB) are used as well as gradient-index lenses to project these patterns on the specimen. This advanced optical system creates high demands on the pattern generation algorithms to generate exact inverse patterns for arbitrary CAD-modelled geometries. Approaches of optical simulations of the complex beam path and the drawbacks of the limited resolutions of the FOIBs are discussed.

A simplified sinusoidal analysis of the series and parallel resonant converters is carried out with particular attention given to power switch behaviour. Resonant converter behaviour under various operating conditions and parameters is investigated {{in order to develop}} a complete understanding before power switch characterisation. Furthermore stresses on the power switch and the resonant tank under extreme conditions are determined. Three identically rated IGBTs representing the complete range of IGBT variants available today are selected for the ZCS and ZVS characterisation. Experimental results are obtained from two application circuits which produce practical resonant conditions. Test instrumcnlation includes a highly accurate Lecroy power measure system. PSpice results are obtained using an accurate IGBT model based on the Kraus model while 2 -D mixed mode simulations are used to study the <b>internal</b> <b>carrier</b> dynamics under resonant switching. A comprehensive analysis and modelling of the IGBT conduction and switching losses in ZCS and ZVS is carried out. Mathematical models are developed giving careful consideration to all the significant features and dependant parameters, namely collector current, switching frequency and case temperature. Model refinement and validation is carried out using the device characterisation results obtained above. The refined model can be made available in a manufacturer's datasheet either as characteristic equations or characteristic curves. A detailed study of the parasitic effects on IGBT power modules in hard switching and resonant switching conditions is presented. For resonant switching characterisation of the IGBT power module a test rig accommodating four different resonant inverter topologies is designed and built. Parasitic inductance effects due to each IGBT terminal is analysed individually in order to identify the effects clearly. Current sharing imbalances in paralleled IGBTs within power modules are comprehensively analysed. The findings and tools resulting from this research will be useful for various sectors in the power electronics industry. The IGBT and power diode characterisations as well as the power loss models will assist the power device designers in the development of optimised devices for future applications. Power device selection for resonant applications will be made accurate and easier by including the characteristic curves or equations within published datasheets. Furthermore optimisation of the parasitics in the power modules will be made possible for specific applications.

Their dependence upon the incoming light polarization is a well-known, but still debated, issue in the context of emerging optical telecommunication networks, fueling the need for a detailed polarimetric characterization of such structures.

Our approach to solving this problem involves decoupling the rules, giving them a simple, easy-to-understand representation, and creating an engine to apply these rules to incoming forms automatically. This paper presents our approach in detail, explains its parallelism and briefly presents the differences with other common rule-based engines. Keywords: Rule-Based systems, Form Validation. Frameworks. Parallel Programming. 1 INTRODUCTION The OMT/SIGS project at GTE Laboratories is aimed at automating order processing. The orders are loosely called Local Service Requests (LSRs) or Local Ser [...] ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that the size of}} internal droplets in primary emulsion determines emulsion dispersion and stability in emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) process for removal of lignin from pulping wastewater. Generally, primary emulsion contains kerosene, Aliquat 336, sodium bicarbonate, as well as Span 80 as diluent, <b>carrier,</b> <b>internal</b> phase, and surfactant, respectively. Hence, this study had looked into the parameters, including concentration of surfactant, carrier, and stripping agent; emulsification speed and time; as well as agitation speed and time. As a result, the diameter of the smallest droplets (1. 4 µm) was formed with maximum lignin extraction (95 %), minimum swelling (5 %) at 3 % (w/v) surfactant concentration, 12, 000 rpm of emulsification within 5 minutes, 0. 01 M of Aliquat 336, 0. 1 M of NaHCO 3, and 250 rpm of extraction within 10 minutes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to propose a tabu search {{heuristic}} for the split delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Production and Demand Calendars (VRPPDC). This new problem consists of determining which customers will be served by a common carrier, as well as the delivery routes for those served by the private fleet, in order to minimize the overall transportation and inventory costs. We first model this problem and then propose a simple decomposition procedure that can be used to provide a starting solution. Next, we introduce a new tabu search heuristic and we describe two new neighbor reduction strategies. Finally, we present the results of our extensive computational tests. According to these tests, our reduction strategies are efficient not only at reducing computing time but also at improving the overall solution quality.

40|$|The LysE {{superfamily}} {{consists of}} transmembrane transport proteins that catalyze export of amino acids, lipids and heavy metal ions. Statistical means {{were used to}} show that it includes newly identified families including transporters specific for (1) tellurium, (2) iron/lead, (3) manganese, (4) calcium, (5) nickel/cobalt, (6) amino acids, and (7) peptidoglycolipids as well as (8) one family of transmembrane electron <b>carriers.</b> <b>Internal</b> repeats and conserved motifs were identified, and multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees and average hydropathy, amphipathicity and similarity plots provided evidence that all members of the superfamily derived from a single common 3 -TMS precursor peptide via intragenic duplication. Their common origin implies that they share common structural, mechanistic and functional attributes. The transporters of this superfamily play important roles in ionic homeostasis, cell envelope assembly, and protection from excessive cytoplasmic heavy metal/metabolite concentrations. They thus influence the physiology and pathogenesis of numerous microbes, being potential targets of drug action...|$|R
