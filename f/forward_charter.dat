5000|$|In England {{the ancient}} London Stone {{has been put}} <b>forward</b> as a <b>charter</b> stone due to its {{proximity}} to lands once held by Canterbury Cathedral. [...] The Kirkby Stephen charter stone in Cumbria is till used on St Luke’s Fair day in October for {{the reading of the}} market's charter. Also in Cumbria is the Ca'an Stone in the main street of Kendal, once part of the market cross, but possibly older and once used as a place where proclamations were read.|$|R
50|$|Forward Movement {{was created}} {{during a time}} when the Episcopal Church seemed weary and divided. The 51st General Convention in 1924 charged the newly <b>chartered</b> <b>Forward</b> Movement to “reinvigorate {{the life of the church}} and to {{rehabilitate}} its general, diocesan and parochial work.” Bishop Henry Hobson of Southern Ohio chaired the Forward Movement Commission, which consisted of five bishops, five priests, and ten laymen. Although the National Council gave a small subsidy during its first three years, Forward Movement soon became a self-supporting ministry, largely through literature sales.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on {{the monthly}} data set from January 1992 to May 2012, this paper applies a VAR model and two {{time-varying}} coefficient models to analyze term structure in dry bulk freight market. The resulting three main empirical findings are as follows: 1) The response of long-term rate to short- term structural shock {{is relatively small}} and not statistically significant but the response of short-term rate to long-term structural shock is large and statistically significant. 2) Compared with the presumption that in backwardation the short-term rate is inclined to decrease but the long-term rate to increase, but in contango the opposite pressure would function, there is lack of evidence for the stable adjustment speed in both equations for the short- and long-term freight rate. 3) When the market is relatively above the normal level (more backwardation), {{the effect of the}} implied <b>forward</b> time <b>charter</b> (IFTC) rate on the actual TC rate becomes larger. When predicting the future TC rate based on IFTC rate, it recommends giving more weight to the IFTC rate in backwardation than in contango...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficiency and}} predictive power of implied <b>forward</b> shipping <b>charter</b> rates. In particular, we examine whether implied forward 6 -month time-charter rates, which are derived through the difference between time-charters with different maturities based on the term structure model, are efficient and unbiased predictors of actual future time-charter rates. Using a dataset for the period January 1989 to June 2003, results of different statistical tests, including the cointegration approach, suggest that implied forward rates are in fact unbiased predictors of future time-charter rates in the dry bulk freight market. In addition, {{it is found that}} implied forward rates yield superior forecasts compared to alternative univariate and multivariate time series models. However, while the unbiasedness hypothesis is found to hold, on average, we find that chartering strategies based on simple trend-following trading rules in this cyclical market are able to generate economic profits even out-of-sample. This highlights how standard tests for unbiasedness do not always capture cyclical predictable components in the market behaviour. [*][*]Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
25|$|Ramsay {{is said to}} {{have brought}} great energy to the talk of {{improving}} the College. He embarked on a round of after-dinner parties to promote the College, and in 1883 he was able to build a purpose-built laboratory. In 1884 the College came close to bankruptcy when the Treasurer announced that funds would dry up within two months. The College survived, but two professors were given notice of dismissal and their departments were placed on a self-supporting notice. At this time Welsh colleges were able to receive financial support but not English ones, so English colleges therefore decided to lobby the Government for funding. The result was that English colleges would receive a grant of £15000, of which Bristol gained the modest share of £1,200. Ramsay resigned his post in 1887 after being appointed Chair of Chemistry at University College, London. Although no longer Principal, after his resignation he used his influence to lobby the College council to appoint his assistant Morris Travers to the Chair of Chemistry when the position became vacant. Travers is credited with pushing <b>forward</b> the <b>Charter</b> campaign during the beginning of the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|The vision, {{design and}} {{implementation}} of e-governance in India with its attendant “datafication” leads to many pertinent questions about {{the changing nature of}} governance and state-citizen engagement. This Brief argues that data-based decision-making in India {{is part of a larger}} trend that seems to displace the complex ingredients of participatory governance - dialogue, deliberation, audit and answerability - in favour of a fait accompli that disempowers citizens. Whether it is biometric based authentication systems, online grievance mechanisms or Big Data based beneficiary rationalisation, the absence of modes for a meaningful right to be heard, right to contest and seek accountability, decouple citizenship from rights and justice. The authors take the view that digital technologies in governance and data-based solutions need to be harnessed towards strengthening grassroots democracy rather than alienating it. They put <b>forward</b> the <b>Charter</b> on Democratic Accountability in the Digital Age as a step towards consolidating this emerging dialogue on data governance / data in governance. The Brief ends with a stark warning: The civic-public value of the digital governance paradigm must be co-constructed by citizens. if the much acclaimed openness of the digital movement cannot be put to the service of participatory grassroots democracy, democracy itself runs the risk of being cannibalised. This brief is part of a series from IT for Change produced from its Voice or Chatter research project, which examines the relationship between ICT-mediated citizen engagement and democratic governance.

40|$|It {{has been}} more than a decade since Justice Arbour’s dissenting {{judgment}} in Gosselin, the first and only Supreme Court of Canada judgment recognizing positive rights under section 7. The jurisprudence that has developed in the intervening years presents some challenges to pursuing such a claim today. Yet the author offers the view that because of the special vulnerability of children, their capacity for development and the state’s treatment of children in other contexts, recognition of positive rights for children is consistent with Canada’s legal/political traditions, current laws and jurisprudence. Childhood, the refore, may well be the “special circumstance” necessary to push positive section 7 rights <b>forward</b> under the <b>Charter.</b> In light of the growing disparities in wealth in Canada, and the link between poverty and the ability to meet a child’s basic needs, such an outcome is urgently needed in the interests of justice to ensure that all children eventually have an equal opportunity to be involved in society’s most important institutions, which ultimately control distribution of wealth, goods and opportunity...|$|R
