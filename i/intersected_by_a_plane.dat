There {{are several}} {{processes}} used in mathematics which require to {{be distinguished from}} Induction, being not unfrequently called by that name, and being so far similar to Induction properly so called, that the propositions they lead to are really general propositions. For example, when we have proved {{with respect to the}} circle, that a straight line can not meet it in more than two points, and when the same thing has been successively proved of the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola, it may be laid down as a universal property of the sections of the cone. The distinction drawn in the two previous examples can have no place here, there being no difference between all known sections of the cone and all sections, since a cone demonstrably can not be <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> except in one of these four lines. It would be difficult, therefore, to refuse to the proposition arrived at, the name of a generalization, since {{there is no room for}} any generalization beyond it. But there is no induction, because there is no inference: the conclusion is a mere summing up of what was asserted in the various propositions from which it is drawn. A case somewhat, though not altogether, similar, is the proof of a geometrical theorem by means of a diagram. Whether the diagram be on paper or only in the imagination, the demonstration (as formerly observed(101)) does not prove directly the general theorem; it proves only that the conclusion, which the theorem asserts generally, is true of the particular triangle or circle exhibited in the diagram; but since we perceive that in the same way in which we have proved it of that circle, it might also be proved of any other circle, we gather up into one general expression all the singular propositions susceptible of being thus proved, and embody them in a universal proposition. Having shown that the three angles of the triangle ABC are together equal to two right angles, we conclude that this is true of every other triangle, not because it is true of ABC, but for the same reason which proved it to be true of ABC. If this were to be called Induction, an appropriate name for it would be, induction by parity of reasoning. But the term can not properly belong to it; the characteristic quality of Induction is wanting, since the truth obtained, though really general, is not believed on the evidence of particular instances. We do not conclude that all triangles have the property because some triangles have, but from the ulterior demonstrative evidence which was the ground of our conviction in the particular instances.|$|E

The present paper considers models where a statistically homogeneous system of hard spheres with random radii is <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> {{and the surface}} is formed by the spheres with centers close to this plane. Formulae are derived for various characteristics of such surfaces: for the porosity profile, i. e. the local porosity in dependence on {{the distance from the}} section plane and for the geometry of the sphere caps that look above the section plane. It turns out that these characteristics only depend on the first-order characteristics of the sphere system, its sphere density and the sphere radius distribution. Comparison with empirically studied biofilms shows that the model is realistic. </p...|$|E

40|$|In a {{proposed}} experiment, a measurement {{is to be}} made of the angular precession of a rotating superconducting gyroscope for the purpose of testing different general-relativity theories. For various reasons {{having to do with the}} design of the experiment, the superconducting shield surrounding the gyroscope is not spherically symmetric and produces a torque. There are two distinct features of the shield which lead to a torque on the gyroscope. First, its shape is a sphere <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane.</b> If the angular momentum of the gyroscope is not parallel to the rotational symmetry axis of the shield, there is a torque which is calculated. Second, there are small holes in the spherical portion of the shield. The earth's field can penetrate through these holes and give an additional torque which is also calculated. In the actual experiment, these torques must be accurately known or made very small in order to obtain meaningful results. The present calculation is sufficiently general for application over a wide range of experimental design parameters...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the theory}} of {{projective}} correspondence, the principle of affine correspondence and projective correspondence is proposed to resolve the intersection of non-circular quadric curved surface(NCQCS). According {{to the theory of}} projective geometry, the intersection that NCQCS intersect with a set of parallel <b>planes</b> is <b>a</b> group of homothetic curves. Taking the homothetic curves as corresponding element, spatial projective correspondence between any two homothetic curves is constructed. Similarly, the intersection that any NCQCS <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> set of <b>planes</b> through it axis is a group of similar curves. Taking the similar curves as associated element, spatial affine correspondence between any two similar curves is constructed.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to dynamic model-based feature prediction and feature planning for our laser scanner-based navigation system. The system enables autonomous precise maneuvering of vehicles relative to target objects based on 2 D laser range data. An adaptive tracking algorithm uses predicted features to localize the target. Jump edges, line segments, line intersections and free space areas are considered. Feature prediction {{is based on an}} attributed polygonal 3 D object model representing object surfaces, masking volumes and free space volumes. The model is <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> virtual scan <b>plane</b> to dynamically determine all detectable features for the current sensor pose.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the average-case-analysis {{of the number of}} pivot steps {{required}} by the simplex method. It generalizes results of Borgwardt (who worked under the assumpution of the rotation-symmetry-model) for the shadow-vertex-algorithm to so-called cylindric distributions. Simultaneously it allows to analyze an extended dimension-by-dimension-algorithm, which solves linear programing problems with arbitrary capacity bounds b in the restrictions Ax<=b, whereas the model used by Borgwardt required strictly positive right hand sides b. These extensions are achieved <b>by</b> solving <b>a</b> problem of stochastic geometry closely related to famous results of Renyi and Sulanke, namely: Assume that a_ 1, [...] .,a_m are uniformly distributed in a cylinder. How many facets of conv(a_ 1, [...] .,a_m, 0) will be <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional shadow <b>plane</b> along the axis of the cylinder.

40|$|In {{ultrasonic}} {{nondestructive evaluation}} (NDE) studies, impulse response {{is often used}} to evaluate internal defects. Under the far-field Born approximation [1], the impulse response can be written as the product of the second derivative of the area function with respect to the coordinate along the line-of-sight and a scattering constant which depends on the material properties as well as scattering directions [2]. The line-of-sight is a straight line along the illumination direction for pulse-echo tests, and the area function is an artificial time domain waveform equal to the target cross-sectional area <b>intersected</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> imaginary transverse <b>plane</b> travelling along the line-of-sight. Hence the double integration of the impulse response yields the product of the area function and the scattering constant. This product is also known as the ramp function response or the ramp response. Dividing the ramp response by its integral results the area function per volume of the target (normalized area function) [2] thus eliminating the unknown scattering constant. Since the area function (or its normalized form) contains the geometric information about the target, it has been employed in studies of both radar [3 – 5] and ultrasonic signal imaging [6]. In this paper, an ultrasonic CT algorithm is develped, using the area function from the Born approximation previously suggested <b>by</b> Tam [7]. <b>A</b> similar imaging technique for radar signals can be found in an earlier work done by Das and Boerner [5]...|$|R
40|$|<b>As</b> {{described}} <b>by</b> McLelland and Isachsen, {{the southern}} {{half of the}} Adirondacks are underlain by major isoclinal (F sub 1) and open-upright (F sub 2) folds whose axes are parallel, trend approximately E-W, and plunge gently about the horizontal. These large structures are themselves folded by open upright folds trending NNE (F sub 3). It is pointed out that elongation lineations in these rocks are parallel to X of the finite strain ellipsoid developed during progressive rotational strain. The parallelism between F sub 1 and F sub 2 fold axes and elongation lineations led to the hypothesis that progressive rotational strain, with a west-directed tectonic transport, rotated earlier F sub 1 -folds into parallelism with the evolving elongation lineation. Rotation is accomplished by ductile, passive flow of F sub 1 -axes into extremely arcuate, E-W hinges. In order to test these hypotheses a number of large folds were mapped in the eastern Adirondacks. Other evidence supporting the existence of sheath folds in the Adirondacks is the presence, on a map scale, of synforms whose limbs pass through the vertical and into antiforms. This type of outcrop pattern is best explained <b>by</b> <b>intersecting</b> <b>a</b> horizontal <b>plane</b> with the double curvature of sheath folds. It is proposed that sheath folding is a common response of hot, ductile rocks to rotational strain at deep crustal levels. The recognition of sheath folds in the Adirondacks reconciles the E-W orientation of fold axes with an E-W elongation lineation...|$|R
