The {{definitive}} article is archived by Wiley-Blackwell here: [URL] article discusses new forms of self-representation that have recently emerged among Austrian and German Romany or "Gypsy" writers. Their texts emphasize the performative nature of memory, culture, and writing. These memory performances suggest interesting forms of Vergegenw??rtigung that display the complex relationships between past and present, and between the majority and minority groups. Autobiographical writings and other artistic expressions by Ceija Stojka and Otto Rosenberg represent test cases {{of what it means to}} be "Austrian" or "German" today, especially after 1989. Writing and singing perform important acts of memory that continue the Romany tradition yet are also meant to disrupt the repression of Roma. These forms of autobiography can be viewed as critical auto-performances that create and undo themselves at the same time. Writing and performing from an <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective,</b> Stojka and Rosenberg urge us to rethink our notions of cultural and national identity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project {{described}} here is to demonstrate how the introduction of subject matter and principles from citizenship education into foreign language education combines objectives from both {{in order to give}} meaning to language education {{on the one hand and}} extend citizenship education beyond a focus on the local and the national on the other. In doing so, the educational aims of foreign language teaching – as well as its instrumental purposes – can be met and the scope of citizenship education is extended to include intercultural citizenship. The project was located in Higher Education in Argentina, where 76 students were learning English, and in Britain, where 23 students were learning Spanish. It focused on human rights violations during the football World Cup that took place in Argentina in 1978 during a period of military dictatorship and it was carried out in 2013 during a fourth-month period. Data were collected then and comprise documentary data (posters, PowerPoints, videos, etc.) and conversational data (online communication between the Argentinian and British students using Skype). This article describes the processes of the project and the ways in which students reacted, particularly the Argentinian students who felt personally involved, and demonstrates how the combination of language and citizenship education, when given the additional viewpoint of an <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective,</b> leads to significant developments in learners' lives: an identification with a transnational group and perspective, and a willingness to become directly and critically involved in action in the community...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{significance}} of Sámi and indigenous vocal and musical expression in ethno and indigenous political mobilizing in the 1970 s and particularly in June 1979. My point of departure is the Davvi Šuvva festival; the first Sámi and international indigenous culture and music festival after the establishing of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples. It took place on a hill in a Sámi and Swedish/Finnish border village {{in the north of}} Sweden {{and in the middle of}} Sápmi. My research is based on the interviews with people who organized the festival, artists and audience as well as written contemporary sources, a film about the event and 16 authentic tapes of recordings of the concerts at Davvi Šuvva. The oral sources of eye and ear witnesses represent insider views and experiences and the contemporary written sources of attending news paper journalists and writers from other magazines represent both <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective.</b> “Davvi Šuvva 1979 ” also documents the ethno political background of the festival and discusses various perspectives on collective identity. While powwow dance and traditional native chanting expressed First Nation and Cree Indian identity and Inuit identity was expressed by traditional drum dance and drum singing Davvi Šuvva also demonstrated how yoik conveyed various Sámi identities. My intention is to show how and why vocal and musical expressions had, and still have, a particular significance in oral indigenous cultures as a means of struggle. The conclusions reached are that manifestations of Sámi and indigenous cultural expression and resistance like the Davvi Šuvva festival contributed to pride, recovery, dignity and positive self awareness and that the festival as such strengthened Sámi identity and indigenous togetherness and belonging...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{decision}} making of coronary care nurses in acute situations. More specifically, the study explored how coronary care nurses take their decisions and what are the factors that underpin those decisions. Background: Studies on clinical decision making have focused on the effect of nurses' experience on decision making, and on the decisions that are made. Until now there is very little data available that focuses on coronary care nurse's clinical decision making in acute situations, and what the factors are that underpin those decisions. Therefore there was an urgent need to investigate the decision making of coronary care nurses in acute situations. Method: This study involved eight nurses from three coronary care units from hospitals in the North West of England. An interpretive approach based on the principles of ethnography from an <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective</b> was adopted. Data collection from coronary care nurses as they care for patients during an acute situation was used for this study. Both observation and interview were undertaken to ensure complete data collection of all aspects of decision making in real life settings. Results: What become apparent in the findings of this study was that contrary to much of the literature, the nurses on the coronary care units dealt with limited complex acute situation that need complex decisions. The decision making about patient care during the acute situations was quite simple and considered as custom. It was also discovered that nurses tend to focus on the physiological aspects of care rather than a more holistic approach. The data revealed that the decision making process is continuous. The assessment phase started using both analytical and intuitive models in order to observe the cues relating to the patient's situation. The nurses then moved towards the implementation of action strategies to solve the patient's problem. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDAfter South Africa {{became a}} {{democratic}} country in 1994, the South African education ministry devised curriculum changes {{at a national}} level that would reflect an equal education structure for all South Africans. Curriculum 2005 was implemented in 1998 with the curriculum changes gazetted in the Department of Education’s Revised National Curriculum Statement for Grades R- 9 (RNCS) (Schools). South African teachers had to be retrained to implement these curriculum changes. The legislation for teacher education is documented in the Norms and Standards for Educators (NSE) policy document (DoE, 2002). This exploratory phenomenological multiple case study explores teacher identity in connection to how primary school teachers view, perceive and implement the Community, Citizenship and Pastoral (CCP) role at three primary schools in the Western Cape education districts. The three schools chosen {{can be described as}} suburban advantaged, suburban disadvantaged and urban disadvantaged. The overall aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the connection between teacher identity and the views, perceptions and practices of primary school teachers at three schools in the Western Cape in relation to the practical, foundational and reflexive competences of their CCP role. In this multiple case study, qualitative methods are used. The qualitative methods include participant interviews, focus group discussions, unstructured observations and document analyses. Numerical data collected is presented in a quantitative format. An interpretative approach from an <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective</b> has been selected. Terre Blanche,Durrheim & Kelly’s (2006) steps in interpretative data analysis is adopted as well as Max-Neef’s (1991) transdisciplinary approach. This study is informative for a number of stakeholders: teachers, schools, Education Management Development Centres, the Western Cape Education Department and the National Education Department. I report on how teachers see their teacher identity and how this identity impacts on the way teachers view, perceive and approach their CCP role. Some internal and external factors that influence teacher identity include administrative stress, staff dynamics and the results and feedback from learners. The significance of this study lies in the revelation that all teachers, irrespective of their teaching environment or backgrounds, are in need of support. Based on the findings of this investigation I further propose a programme for teacher support that can be encouraged amongst teachers. These recommendations can influence both teacher performance and teacher longevity in schools. Further recommendations are for the extended school community and the synergy that can exist among the various stakeholders in education...|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} use of self-report and observer-rating scales {{is becoming more}} common in family therapy research. However, {{there is a lack}} of consensus among family researchers about how to conjointly interpret data from self-report and observer-rating assessment instruments. In particular, family researchers disagree about whether reports from family members and observers tap similar or fundamentally different aspects of family reality. In this study, I examined Olson 2 ̆ 7 s (1977; 1985) assertion that “insider” and “outsider” perspectives represent qualitatively different domains which should both be examined in order to get a complete clinical view of family functioning. Specifically, I analyzed data from David Olson 2 ̆ 7 s battery of assessment instruments for the Circumplex Model which were used to assess the functioning of 70 couples from both the <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Using confirmatory factor analysis, canonical correlation, and partial correlation, I obtained mixed but mostly negative support for the validity of the Circumplex Model as well as the utility of Olson 2 ̆ 7 s insider/outsider framework. Implications of this study for multi-perspective family assessment, the Circumplex Model, as well as the use of structural equation modeling in family research are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{inextricably}} {{intimate relationships}} connecting the dancer, the dance and the self {{indicate that the}} practice of dance is inherently a reflective practice of feedback looping. Professional dancers are aware of this in continuing self-critical analyses and reflections for self-improvement, striving for the ever-elusive perfection in performance. The reflective nature of learning dance is, however, less apparent to the student of dance due to the traditional master/apprentice approach to dance training. By making explicit the essentially reflective sequence of processes through which the self becomes the dancer of the dance, the locus of control is shifted towards the dance student, thereby increasing the sense of autonomy and intrinsic motivation for exploration, discovery and improvement of her or his own practice. This study documents the implementation of the 4 Rs approach to reflective practice in a university dance training context. Data include reflective observations of dance lessons, and teacher and student reflections on the reflective approach taken in these lessons. <b>Insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspectives</b> from students, the dance teacher and external researchers are taken to provide a nuanced understanding of the value of corporeal, visual and verbal reflection in dance for improved performance. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{interpersonal}} process model, interactions characterized by self-disclosure and empathic responding foster emotional intimacy {{between the two}} participating individuals (Reis & Shaver, 1988). This study provided ?<b>insider?</b> <b>and</b> ?<b>outsider?</b> <b>perspectives</b> of this model, examining the relation between perceived and observed behaviors in couple interactions and their relative contributions {{to the development of}} intimate feelings. The sample consisted of 102 community couples who completed measures of intimacy after engaging in videotaped discussions about relationship injuries that occurred both within and outside of the relationship. Both self-report and observational measures were used to assess disclosure and empathic responding during these discussions. There was significant agreement between self- and observer-report of men?s behavior, between self- and observer-report of women?s male partner?s behavior, and between partners? report of disclosure and empathic responding. There was mixed support for global distress and attachment style as predictors of differences between self- and observer-report. Whereas an earlier study using observational measures found gender differences in the effect of self-disclosure and empathic responding on intimacy (Mitchell et al., 2008), in this study self-report measures from the same sample indicated that perception of both an individual?s own and his or her partner?s disclosure and empathic responding predicted intimacy for both men and women. Observational measures provided incremental validity relative to self-report measures in predicting intimacy. These findings suggest that targeting certain personal and relational characteristics may be helpful in treating intimacy deficits and also indicate that self-report and observational measures provide unique information about the influence of behaviors on the development of intimate feelings in couple relationships...|$|R

Han Nah Jung, Liu Li, Xia Wang, Yu Ri Koh, and Shu-Ming Fung recounted journeying through their educational experiences in their native countries {{as well as in}} the United States. The purposes of this study were to (1) deepen and enrich our understanding of the women?s diverse educational journeys, (2) uncover the ideological nature of the lives of these women who may have become marginalized due to the issues of race, gender, and language, (3) look at their experiences as juxtaposed to my own as a person with both <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspectives,</b> <b>and</b> (4) use the women?s narratives to make recommendations for improving TESOL teacher education programs. This study explored the lived experiences of five East Asian women, utilizing a past-present-future timeline (e. g., Looking Back, Reflecting On, and Thinking Forward), grounded in critical and feminist perspectives, to examine how those experiences shaped their identities in different learning and teaching communities. This was accomplished through the utilization of electronic reflective autobiographical questions, electronic educational journal entries, in-depth interviews, and informal/formal conversations. The analysis of their narratives, as grounded in critical and feminist perspectives, revealed the interconnectedness between language, race, gender, and social class which were all deeply embedded in their educational journeys. Specifically, the women, despite being from primarily privileged backgrounds, experienced varying degrees of marginalization within their TESOL programs as a result of issues pertaining to language, gender, and race. However, their pre-service and/or volunteer teaching experiences served to heighten their identities as burgeoning English (Korean) language teachers. Findings from the studies such as this should serve to begin dialogues around renewing and reconceptualizing better TESOL curricula and teacher education programs and provide some momentum for instituting improvements in these TESOL programs over the coming years...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a linking study designed to provide empirical evidence {{on which to base}} claims about the connection between the listening test suite of the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The investigation was guided by the recommended methods and procedures set out in the manual Relating language examinations to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: learning, teaching, assessment (Council of Europe, 2009), and entailed the stages of familiarisation, specification, standardisation and empirical validation. In addition, the project involved an innovative research design marked by a) a pilot stage to evaluate the suitability of two different standard setting methods for a linking study with listening test materials (the basket method and the modified Angoff method), and b) an asynchronous “twin-panel” approach. This methodology allowed for the inclusion and comparison of both <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspectives</b> through a panel of six language testing/teaching/standard setting experts without prior knowledge of the GEPT suite and a separate panel of six teachers/researchers/developers with an intimate knowledge of the GEPT suite. Preliminary alignments and cut scores were established by the researchers at the specification stage. Informed by the pilot study, a two-step adapted version of the basket method was developed which requires the standard setter to assign each item to a particular CEFR “basket” and, in addition, to decide whether a just-qualified, a mid, or a high test-taker at the particular CEFR level would already be able to answer the item correctly. After a familiarisation process with the CEFR, the GEPT, and the standard setting procedures, this modified basket method was used by the panels to judge the CEFR level of GEPT listening items. Validation checks were realised through judgement reliability analyses, judgement comparisons across panels, and qualitative analysis of recorded panel discussions. Based on the full linking study – including individual and combined panel data analyses – recommendations are made for the alignment of the GEPT listening suite with the Common European Framework of Reference. In addition, a set of suggestions is formulated in order for the GEPT listening tests to be more easily articulated with the CEFR descriptors, and in so doing to increase the validity of alignment to the framework...|$|R

40|$|Engaging with {{participants}} on Facebook during ethnographic fieldwork {{has become increasingly}} prevalent in research, especially when exploring complex and sensitive consumption issues (Chenail, 2011; Piacenti et al., 2014). Such engagement not only provides a complementary medium of communication but also provides a context {{and a source of}} data from which emic and etic interpretations can be made (Baker, 2013; Dogruer et al., 2011). Despite, extant literature focuses predominantly on "how-to" aspects of integrating Facebook in ethnographic research (Baker, 2013), thus, creating a need to amiliorate epistemological and methodological issues of integrating Facebook in ethnographic research. For example, further research can help ethnographic researchers to understand the ways in which Facebook, as a methodological tool in ethnographic research, can encourage close rapport {{with participants}} leading to rich and thick interpretations of complex phenomena. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to theorise epistemological and methodological implications of integrating Facebook in conventional ethnographic research. Accordingly, we present three research questions. Firstly, how to engage with participants on their Facebook profiles to build a productive rapport with them during ethnographic fieldwork? Building on friendship theories (Owton and Allen-Collinson, 2014; Tillmann-Healy, 2003), we suggest that Facebook engagement encourages rapport building by enabling researchers to gradually develop dialogical researcher-participant relationships by paying close attention to aspects such as practice, pace, context, and the 'ethics of friendships' (Tillmann-Healy, 2003). Secondly, what challenges inherent to conventional ethnographic research does increased rapport enable researchers to overcome? We propose that Facebook helps overcome three challenges inherent to conventional ethnography: 1) negotiating access and immersion, 2) developing multiple perspectives, and 3) providing rich and thick interpretations. Thirdly, how Facebook engagement enables the navigation of these challenges? Our findings contribute to consumer and cross disciplinary ethnographic literature (Baker, 2013; Piacenti et al., 2014) and provide evidence that utilising Facebook allows researchers to overcome such challenges by expanding the researcher's field, improving participants' trust and confidence of the researcher, bringing both <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perspectives,</b> <b>and</b> diluting the power hierarchy often found in participant-researcher relationships. However, we also propose that our contributions have implications beyond conventional ethnography and are relevant to wider netnographic(Kozinets, 2010; 2015) and social mediaoriented ethnographic research (Postill and Pink, 2012). Our proposed framework could be useful for netnographic researchers seeking to build a close rapport with participants as it sheds light on epistemological and methodological issues about one of the popular social networking sites that provides, as Kozinets (2015, p. 35) classifies, a "hyving social experience". In addition, we also contribute to an emerging body of cross-disciplinary literature on "friendship as method" (Owton and Allen-Collinson, 2014; Ellis, 2007; Glesne, 1989; Tillmann-Healy, 2003) by theorising the role of Facebook engagement in inspiring and sustaining 'friendships' with participants during ethnographic research. We have structured the paper as follows: Firstly, we engage with cross-disciplinary literature on ethnography, netnography, theories of friendship, and Facebook. Secondly, we introduce the research methodology, and the overarching ethnographic research process. Thirdly, we draw from our ethnographic fieldwork to illustrate how integrating Facebook facilitates friendships with participants and allows us to investigate deeper and richer details of their everyday lived experiences during important transitions, in our case, the transition from single to marital status. Finally, we discuss some of the important ethical/moral implications of "friendship as method" and the complexities of integrating Facebook in ethnographic research and elaborate on the ways in which we addressed such complexities...|$|R
40|$|Introduction/Background: Despite the {{consensus}} {{on the importance of}} participation as an outcome measure of rehabilitation a lot of problems remain in the operational application of the concept. There is still a need for a comprehensive participation measure combining the <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> the <b>outsiders</b> <b>perspective</b> of the patient. Therefore a new participation measure, the GPS (The Ghent Participation scale) has been developed. Material and Methods: Objective: To examine the psychometric of the Ghent Participation Scale (GPS). Design: Cross sectional study with a test-retest sample. Patients: 365 former rehabilitation outpatients from 8 diagnostic groups in 6 rehabilitation centers. Material: The GPS and the IPA (Impact on participation and autonomy), the USER-Participation (The Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation Participation - USER) and the SF- 36 (Medical outcome study Short Form). Results: The GPS addresses participation in 3 dimensions: (1) performing activities according to preferred choices and wishes, (2) performing activities leading to social appreciation and acceptance (3) the need to delegate activities. The GPS shows a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α between 0. 752 and 0. 83). On item level, the test retest reliability was good, weighted kappa’s ranged between 0. 57 and 0. 88. On the dimension level: intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between 0. 80 and 0. 90. The construct validity was supported by high correlations between subscales form the GPS and 4 subscales of the IPA (range, r= - 0. 71 to - 0. 87) and 2 subscales of the USER-P (range, r= 0. 54 to 0. 72). Standardized response mean (SRM) ranged between 0. 23 and 0. 68 and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranged between 68 and 88 %. Conclusion: The GPS appears to be a reliable and valid measure to rate participation irrespective of the individual’s health condition. The GPS is responsive and is able to detect changes over time...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{acknowledged}} that the researcher has a personal interest or ‘stake’ in the research, and the emphasis on reflexivity in qualitative research has arisen out of a willingness to acknowledge the researcher’s ‘agenda’, almost as if to ‘come clean’ about it. This still assumes that the researcher’s subjectivity may ‘contaminate’ the research {{and needs to be}} kept away from participants’ accounts which are seen as holding more claims to ‘truth’. Objectives: This paper examines some implications of the researcher co-participating in their own research, using the example of a recently completed study of the experience of ‘sensing the presence of the deceased’ in bereavement. The focus of the study was on the perceivers’ subjective experience; it asked what role this experience might play in post-bereavement meaning-making. This presentation considers some potential benefits and pitfalls of being both the researcher and one of the researched and the methodological implications of taking a mixed insider-outsider perspective. Design: Data were collected through one-to-one semi-structured interviews, using open-ended questions to enable participants to describe their experiences as freely as possible. The transcribed interviews were subjected to a version of thematic analysis. Methods: Participants were recruited through non-religious community groups and snowballing. Participants had to have reported at least one ‘sense of presence’ experience and to have been bereaved for at least 18 months. Twelve participants were included, two of whom were the researchers themselves, who interviewed each other. Rather than attempting to ‘bracket’ personal experiences, it was decided to acknowledge the researchers’ subjectivities more openly but place clear limitations on them by subjecting them to the parameters of participants’ accounts. All accounts underwent the same coding process and codes were then grouped meaningfully under initial themes. Data extracts were collated accordingly. Overarching themes were developed and repeatedly checked and reviewed. Results: Seven overarching themes were identified across the data set, three of which were considered key: ‘finding benefit in the continuation of the deceased’, ‘finding benefit in the continued relationship’ and ‘finding meaning through existential, spiritual and religious sense-making’. There was considerable variation between individual accounts, and the researchers’ accounts did not stand out as more or less homogeneous compared {{to the rest of the}} data set. It was found that co-participation led to a greater emphasis on reflexivity during the analysis and it was noted that variability in data treatment may occur equally when dealing with one’s own material as when dealing with that of another. Awareness of any data being potentially self- or other-generated led to an attitude of decentredness or ‘mindfulness’, a stance beyond a traditional insider or <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective.</b> Conclusions: Methodologically, it was concluded that active co-participation can promote empathy and reflexivity and encourage a levelling between researcher and researched. Traversing the traditional boundary between ‘subject’ and ‘object’ and assuming a dual insider-outsider identity may constitute a creative tension and entail shifts in perspective. Furthermore, moving back and forth between an <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> an <b>outsider</b> <b>perspective</b> can lead to a greater sense of ‘epoché’ than traditional ‘bracketing’...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores several {{dynamics in}} <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> activism in the anti-war movement: insider-outsider cooperation and conflict in protest coalitions; transnational protest events' success in uniting <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> outsiders; <b>and</b> coupling of <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> tactics such as protesting and voting. Insider-outsider cooperation in protest coalitions helps to facilitate successful protest events involving rainbow coalitions of <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders.</b> Such events catalyze future insider-outsider cooperation, illustrate which parties are movement allies, educate parties about protesters' concerns, educate protesters about coupling <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> tactics, <b>and</b> may help remobilize activists as voters in subsequent elections. Key rival arguments that are investigated are whether grievances opposing U. S. unilateralism in Iraq, on {{which there was}} a strong issue consensus, are as important as Tarrow's politically opportune domestic targets, such as a government joining the "Coalition of the Willing," in accounting for dynamics in <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> activism. Cross-national surveys of protesters are paired with content analysis of news coverage of transnational anti-war protest events and with elite interviews of activists. While domestic targets appear to exert some centripetal forces facilitating cooperation between <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders,</b> issue consensus or issue discord on grievances can create either centripetal forces that unite or centrifugal forces that unleash conflict. Grievances have the power to unite or to divide us, and whether they do depends on the issue consensus in the movement and the public about them. Grievances with issue consensus unite us, exerting centripetal forces on <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> activism, whereas grievances with issue discord divide us, wielding centrifugal forces on <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders.</b> Opposing U. S. unilateralism in Iraq without the United Nations, on which there is issue consensus, brings together <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> in protest coalitions, at protest events, and in protesters' tactical choices, and thus has the potential to remobilize protesters as voters. Conversely, linking opposition to war in Iraq with other grievances on which there is discord, such as opposition to war in all cases, opposition to globalization, and support of Palestine, divides <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> in protest coalitions and at protest events and may lead protesters to expand their globalized protest involvement...|$|R

40|$|Draft, {{comments}} welcome A growing literature {{argues that}} politics in mature welfare states {{is characterized by}} new distributive conflicts. New risk groups are expected to advocate specific policies, which respond to their particular needs. The dualization-literature conceptualizes these risk groups in terms of <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders,</b> depending on their labor market vulnerability. In this paper, we test whether <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> differ in their policy preferences. Redistribution and social investment typically target the needs of outsiders, while social insurance and performance-related incomes are more advantageous for insiders. Hence, we test whether we find insider-outsider divides with regard to preferences for these policies. In addition, we also test interaction effects with education, since high- <b>and</b> low-skilled <b>outsiders</b> have distinctive risk profiles and needs. The analysis is based on micro-level data from the ESS 2008. The results consistently confirm the expected insider-outsider divide with regard to all analyzed policy preferences (redistribution, social investment, social insurance and the respondent’s support for performance-related incomes). Further, the analysis of interaction effects with education shows that insider-outsider divides on social investment and social insurance prevail only among the medium- and high-skilled respondents, whereas attitudes on the redistribution of income differ between <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> throughout the whole workforce. The paper provides evidence that the increasing dualization of labor markets is reflected in individual preferences and attitudes. This is an important result for studies that analyze the political mobilization of <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> <b>and</b> – more generally – the implications of dualization for post-industrial welfare politics. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} compensatory-discrimination policies in a caste-based segregated economy where some high-paid positions in a certain industry are reserved for low-caste insiders {{as a consequence of}} the implementation of the policies. Cultural attitudes towards preferences for work-loving and leisure-loving traits evolve endogenously. The economy will converge to the efficient (inefficient) equilibrium with larger (smaller) fractions of work lovers among the <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> populations if the profits in the industry with the purview of the reservation policy are sufficiently low (high) or the profits in the industry without the purview of the reservation policy are sufficiently high (low). Changes in the degree of compensatory-discrimination policies will affect the dynamics for <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> differently. ...|$|R

40|$|For a long time, the {{corporate}} governance decisions and the connected disclosure activities were often direct {{to the satisfaction}} of shareholders’ expectations, sometimes with significant differences related to the characteristics of the stock markets and the composition of {{the corporate}} ownership.

The emergence of the concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Stakeholder Relations Management involves modifications in the corporate governance approach, according with the philosophy of sustainable development as critical element for long-term success in global markets.
