25|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>genomics</b> is a {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology that attempts {{to make use of}} the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. <b>Functional</b> <b>genomics</b> focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, and protein–protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. <b>Functional</b> <b>genomics</b> attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products.

25|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} been used to conduct genome-wide analyses of mRNAs – unprocessed and processed – thus providing insights into alternative splicing. For example, results from use of deep sequencing indicate that, in humans, an estimated 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, with a number of pre-mRNA transcripts spliced in a tissue-specific manner. <b>Functional</b> <b>genomics</b> and computational approaches based on multiple instance learning have also been developed to integrate RNA-seq data to predict functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. Deep sequencing has also aided in the in vivo detection of the transient lariats that are released during splicing, the determination of branch site sequences, and the large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts.|$|E

C. elegans is particularly useful for RNAi research for two reasons: firstly, the effects of gene silencing are generally heritable, and secondly because delivery of the dsRNA is extremely simple. Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood, bacteria such as E. coli that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract. This [...] "delivery by feeding" [...] is just as effective at inducing gene silencing as more costly and time-consuming delivery methods, such as soaking the worms in dsRNA solution and injecting dsRNA into the gonads.

40|$|Endometriosis is {{a common}} estrogen-dependent {{gynecological}} disease influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified eight genomic regions with strong evidence for association with endometriosis risk and excellent replication in multiple studies. The results represent a significant breakthrough toward understanding endometriosis. However, the significance can be realized only when the associated DNA sequence variation {{is linked to the}} altered regulation and/or function of specific genes and pathways modifying endometriosis risk. This review sets out the multiple steps required to interpret the genetic association results, identify the specific genes likely to be responsible for the altered risk within each region, and obtain the necessary genomic evidence connecting the genetic results to the target genes. Strategies include fine mapping, <b>functional</b> annotation, <b>genomics,</b> and target gene identification through gene expression, epigenetics, and cell-based studies to define direct interactions between causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and target genes.
