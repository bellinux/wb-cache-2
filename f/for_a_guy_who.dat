And, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> died in the pilot, I {{consider}} myself pretty fortunate." [...] Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar. The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony. Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter's help, but when asked, Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story.|$|E

NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work".

500|$|McConaughey and Harrelson {{were among}} a small pool of actors {{considered}} suitable candidates for top billing. Producers contracted McConaughey, {{who had recently}} finished filming Killer Joe (2011), well before True Detective was greenlit by HBO. Pizzolatto, impressed with the actor's performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), originally assigned him the role of Martin Hart, but McConaughey offered [...] "a really compelling argument" [...] for portraying Rustin [...] "Rust" [...] Cohle. When asked about his decision to switch parts in a Variety interview, McConaughey replied: [...] "I wanted to get in that dude’s head. The obsession, the island of a man—I’m always looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> monologues. It’s something really important as I feel I’m going into my better work." [...] To prepare, the actor studied his character through what he described the [...] "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle", a 450-page document he created detailing Rustin's evolution {{over the course of}} the story.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the series}} is an anthology, each season has a {{self-contained}} narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012. True Detective anthology format only required actors to commit to a single season, so Pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing. McConaughey, who had recently finished filming Killer Joe (2011), was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season. Impressed with his performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart, but McConaughey convinced him {{to give him the}} part of Cohle. When asked in a Variety interview about his decision to switch parts, the actor replied, [...] "I wanted to get in that dude's head. The obsession, the island of a man—I'm always looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> monologues. It's something really important as I feel I'm going into my better work." [...] To prepare for the role, McConaughey created a 450-page analysis—the [...] "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle"—to study his character's evolution during the season.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hot" [...] was {{the third}} single, {{released}} in October 2007. The song was written by Lavigne herself and Evan Taubenfeld; it showcased Lavigne at her most revealing. The lyrics describe Lavigne's feelings <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> [...] "makes [...] feel hot". The song's music video was considered her sexiest to date at the time. The single was the least successful in the US, charting only at No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, yet it managed {{to reach the top}} 10 in Japan and Canada, and top 20 in Australia. A version of the song was recorded in which the chorus was replaced with lyrics in Mandarin.|$|E

John Aizlewood of Q {{felt that it}} is [...] "let down by Reznor's refusal to trouble himself with melody and by some embarrassing lyrics". NMEs Victoria Segal panned its music as [...] "background" [...] and accused it of [...] "chas 'crossover'", with [...] "grey rock sleet masquerading as a storm beneath a haze of 'experimental' textures." [...] Scott Seward of The Village Voice facetiously commended Reznor for [...] "once again ... pioneering the marriage of heavy guitars, moody atmospherics, electronic drones and beats, and aggressive singing. Just like Killing Joke 20 years ago." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was even less receptive, writing that [...] "Reznor delivers double-, every second remixed till it glistens like broken glass on a prison wall.

[...] During a 2001 interview with Bob Costas, Hank was asked whether he would have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy.

Hanks told New York magazine in 1986, [...] "Acting classes looked like the best place <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> liked {{to make a lot}} of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, and all that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky, {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Daredevil and Jessica Jones, serves as costume designer for Luke Cage as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that {{was introduced in}} Jessica Jones. Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the [...] "rich and colorful history" [...] of Harlem, and Coker's own vision. In looking {{to pay homage to}} Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is trying to keep his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.|$|E

RTÉ offered Ryan a new five-year contract worth €600,000 a year in July 2007. Ryan said that just before this he {{came very close to}} signing a deal with Denis O'Brien to present a daytime programme on Newstalk which was about to go national. He was offered several millions more than RTÉ were offering him. Ryan considered the deal, thinking of how one of his best friends Willie O'Reilly was head of sister station Today FM and was heavily involved with the other stations. However negotiations fell apart as Ryan cautioned on how delicate the situation was, with RTÉ looking at his contract and deciding if he was of value to them any more. O'Brien allegedly disappeared and Ryan was told he was out of coverage. The irony was not lost on him – [...] "pretty incredible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> owns most of the world's mobile telephones".

[...] Heisler also praised the subplot of the episode, saying, [...] "I enjoyed Steve's momentary career as a chicken sexer, complete with Roger's cock-fighting hijack-wow, I guess I never thought I'd be writing those words either." [...] He went on to give the episode a B-, the lowest grade of the night, tying with King of the Hill episode [...] "A Bill Full of Dollars", but scoring lower than The Simpsons episode [...] "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" [...] and Family Guy episode [...] "Tales of a Third Grade Nothing".|$|R

5000|$|By {{the time}} The Offspring began writing new {{material}} for their fourth studio album in 1995-1996, {{they were the}} biggest act of Epitaph's roster and had originally declined to leave the label before signing a recording contract with Columbia Records. Following the widespread commercial success of the band's previous album, Smash, frontman Dexter Holland wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz decided to sell Smash to a major label in [...] "return <b>for</b> <b>a</b> royalty override on it," [...] an action that the band did not like. Gurewitz had approached several major labels, such as Geffen, Capitol and Sony, in attempt to sign The Offspring. The band eventually signed to Columbia, and Holland recalled that they [...] "took less money" [...] with the label and the signing [...] "was not {{to try and make}} more money." [...] Holland also claimed that The Offspring signed to Columbia because they would not [...] "record for someone who thinks Gurewitz can force them to" [...] and would not [...] "record <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> worse than <b>a</b> major label."

2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Stephanie Maslansky {{returned from}} the same role on Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in Jessica Jones. The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, [...] "is not made for serious moments", but the series was able to poke fun {{at it in the}} brief scene, with Cage saying [...] "You look like a damn fool" [...] to himself when wearing it. In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is trying to keep his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as [...] "a wealthy, successful businessman", and wears a lot of suits from Dolce & Gabbana and Zegna. One of his suits for the show was custom made. To pay homage to the comic character, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a [...] "subtle shade of green" [...] to avoid being [...] "flamboyant". The character subsequently is always wearing a [...] "subtle piece of green", like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character. For the character Shades, brands such as Hugo Boss, Helmut Lang, Prada, and Ferragamo were used [...] "because he wasn't trying to hide who he was", while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume. That look includes leather pants and an [...] "interesting cold-shoulder"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.|$|E

[...] The Village Voice also gave it a favorable review and stated: [...] "As the dying industry is still breathing in the toxins of useless filler, patrons like John Legend are fully indulging their creativity in all its flawed glory, just like the soul giants of yesteryear." [...] AllHipHop likewise gave it a positive review and stated: [...] "Even if Evolver is less cohesive due to the integration of the Pop sound to the alternative styles Legend played around with in Once Again, it still is light years ahead of any artist mimicking his suave persona." [...] The Boston Globe similarly gave it a positive review and stated that, [...] "As the title suggests, Legend is a work-in-progress, and this stage in his evolution is worth hearing."

[...] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for Supernaturals second season due to his role on Grey's Anatomy. Although he lent his voice for the third season episode [...] "Long-Distance Call," [...] future appearances of Morgan as the character after the second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule.

[...] The scheduling conflict has continued into the sixth season of Supernatural, with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the writers had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] instead of Ellen Harvelle, but due to concerns {{that they would not be}} able to secure Morgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they would have (temporarily) return in the episode. During the {{production of}} the fifth season, Morgan had an interview with MovieWeb in which he stated that no one from the show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed the desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed to be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and he felt that John's storyline had ended too soon.|$|R

Lauren Martin of Fact gave the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Whilst Earl may have the lyrical indie corner down with Doris, Trap Lord posits Ferg as the more ambiguous of the two, once again shifting the goal-posts of what rap can achieve in 2013 with its endearing, street-rap-goes-weird mindset." [...] Dan Buyanovsky of XXL gave the album an L, saying [...] "There are a few shining moments on Trap Lord, like the swaying “Hood Pope,” which finds Ferg crooning about finding his purpose in bleak surroundings, and “Cocaine Castle,” a ruminating, meandering ode to the dark side of drug excess. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who’s</b> able to craft such challenging songs, it’s a shame to see him waste his talent on a batch of hood anthems, but maybe that’s all it takes to become a Trap Lord. On the album’s intro, A$AP Mob’s leader A$AP Yams proclaims, “The limbs never been so relaxed, ever.” You can’t help but wonder if Ferg hadn’t been so relaxed making Trap Lord, it might’ve come out a much stronger work." [...] Anthony Asencio of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Overall, A$AP Ferg’s Trap Lord, is a solid, if an sometimes-uninspired effort. It occupies that zone between the mindless “turn up” music and projects that have gotten <b>a</b> praise <b>for</b> being entertaining enough to at least partially negate <b>a</b> desire <b>for</b> more depth. Ferg is at his best on the handful of songs that reach for something more than male bravado and flossing. But, in the end, listeners don’t get enough of those or his agile rhyme cadences to push this into the realm of an upper-echelon album." ...|$|R
