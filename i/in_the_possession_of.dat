5|$|The {{history of}} the Cotton {{manuscript}} itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions {{that it may have}} been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> at least two of them. It was owned by John Leland, the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the dissolution of the monasteries, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to have been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> Matthew Parker from some time after that until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, the Cotton manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of Lord Lumley and by 1621 the manuscript was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> Robert Cotton. The Cotton library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in Westminster to Essex House in the Strand and then moved again in 1730 to Ashburnham House in Westminster.

5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a rival keeper before the heroes invade {{and try to do}} the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E
