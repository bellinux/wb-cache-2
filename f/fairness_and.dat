5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its {{shows such as}} Washington Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words have been accused by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization <b>Fairness</b> <b>and</b> Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E

40|$|In an {{increasing}} number of studies and papers, the social and political dimensions and principles of agroecology are claimed to be what distinguishes agroecology from other ecologization paradigms or strong from weak agroecology. Among them, the notions of justice <b>and</b> <b>fairness</b> appear as central both in arguments and commitments and in certain specific practices that are experienced by agroecological networks. This communication explores the politics and the practice of justice <b>and</b> <b>fairness,</b> considering arguments <b>and</b> commitments but also actual practices developed in agroecological networks. Three main types of networks are considered here: producer-consumer CSA-type networks, which focus on justice <b>and</b> <b>fairness</b> between farmers <b>and</b> consumers (and sometimes between consumers), formal or informal producers groups which raise issues of <b>fairness</b> between farmers, <b>and</b> territorial agrifood policies which try to deal with justice <b>and</b> <b>fairness</b> within a larger range of social actors involved in the production, distribution and consumption of food. This analysis is based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in such networks in France since 3 to 15 years, which also allows to assess changes in these politics and practice of justice <b>and</b> <b>fairness</b> partly due to internal and external controversies and to learning and reflexive processes but also to interactions between networks at various scales...|$|R
