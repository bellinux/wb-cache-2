He called global warming a hoax in a 2009 Fox Business interview, saying, [...] "You know, the greatest hoax <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been around in many, many years if not hundreds of years has been this hoax {{on the environment and}} global warming." [...] He acknowledges there is clear evidence of rising temperatures {{in some parts of the}} globe, but says that temperatures are cooling in other parts.|$|E
500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> {{a lot to do with}} it." [...] Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.|$|E
500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|We {{stared at}} him astonished, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> he been any other man than the father of my betrothed, I should have struck him. Retief, I noticed, lifted his hand to do so, then let it fall again, muttering: [...] "Let be; he is possessed with a devil." ...|$|R
60|$|However, {{here was}} a {{survival}} {{of the use of}} charm stones, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>had</b> the stone been uninscribed (as it was accidentally inscribed with concentric circles by turning in its stone sockets), my friend's Highland ancestors might have been less apt to think it a fairy thing, and use it in cattle healing.|$|R

2500|$|Maloney {{had trouble}} {{settling}} {{into the club}} but after a somewhat lacklustre start to his Villa career, he began to show his best form. Maloney has acknowledged that his football had been suffering but remained optimistic about his future at the club: [...] "Homesickness has affected my form. I haven't played well enough {{to play in the}} team and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> shown, so hopefully now things can change." [...] Both O'Neill and teammate Stiliyan Petrov, who were both at Celtic during Maloney's time there, had expressed their desire for Maloney to stay at the club despite reports linking him with a move back to Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|Yanni {{explained}} that [...] "the most influence I’ve ever had from music was doing (soundtracks for) movies, ... mostly instrumental music," [...] mentioning {{his love for}} the work of Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams. The Augusta Chronicle's Kelly Jasper noted that most of Yanni's music is instrumental, indicating that Yanni surmised that the lack of lyrics is what allowed his music to become popular internationally. Yanni went on to say, [...] "There are no lyrics in my music for the most part, so the whole message is transmitted through the rhythm, melody, and sounds, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> to do with crossing all the borders and being able to go to different countries.” [...] "It is very difficult, if not impossible, to lie with instrumental music because it deals in emotions only." [...] He has also said that words operate in a different area of the brain, and lyrics [...] "tend to put a song into a box." ...|$|E

In addition to the thinness of which I have spoken, his handsome countenance had grown more ethereal; his eyes were full of the shadows {{of things that were}} to come.|$|R

6000|$|I respond {{without delay}} to {{the blessing of}} your letter of the 6th--which gives me so general a good {{impression}} of you all that I must somehow celebrate it. I {{like to think of}} your tranquil--if the word be the least applicable!--Chocorua summer; and as the time of year comes round again of my sole poor visit there (my mere fortnight from September 1st 1904), the yearning but baffled thought of being with you on that woodland scene and at the same season once more tugs at my sensibilities and is almost too much for me. I have the sense of my then leaving it all unsated, after a beggarly snatch only, and of how I might have done with so much more of it. But I shall pretty evidently have to do with what I got. The very smell and sentiment of the American summer's end there and of Alice's beautiful [...] "rustic" [...] hospitality of overflowing milk and honey, to say nothing of squash pie and ice-cream in heroic proportions, all mingle for me with the assault of forest and lake and of those delicious orchardy, yet rocky vaguenesses and Arcadian [...] "nowheres," [...] which are the note of what is sweetest and most attaching in the dear old American, or particularly New England, scenery. It comes back to me as with such a magnificent beckoning looseness--in relieving contrast to the consummate tightness (a part, too, oddly, of the very wealth of effect) du pays d'ici. It isn't however, luckily, that I have really turned [...] "agin" [...] my landscape portion here, for never so much as this summer, e.g., have I felt the immensely noble, the truly aristocratic, beauty of this splendid county of Sussex, especially as the winged car of offence has monstrously unfolded it to me. This afternoon an amiable neighbour, Mrs. Richard Hennessy, motored me over to Hurstmonceux Castle, which, in spite of its being but about ten miles [...] "back of" [...] Hastings, and not more than twenty from here, I had never yet seen. It's a prodigious romantic ruin, in an adorable old ruined park; but the splendour of the views and horizons, and of the rich composition and perpetual picture and inexhaustible detail of the country, had never more come home to me. I don't do such things, however, every day, thank goodness, and am having the very quietest summer, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> melted away for me (how they do melt!) since I came to live here. I miss the tie of consanguinity--that I have so often felt!--and now (especially since your letter, for you mention his other plans) I find myself calling on the hoped-for Bill in vain. We lately have had (it broke but yesterday) a splendid heated term--very highly heated--following on a wholly detestable June and July and having lasted without a lapse the whole month up to now--which has been admirable and enjoyable and of a renewed consecration to this dear little old garden. I hope it hasn't broken for good, as complications, of sorts, loom for me next month--but the high possibility is that we shall still have earned, and have suffered for in advance, a fine August-end and September. My window is open wide even now--but to the blustering, softly-storming, south-windy midnight. And through thick and thin I have been very quietly and successfully working. It all pans out, I think, in a very promising way, but it is too [...] "important" [...] for me to chatter about save on the proved, or proveable, basis that now seems rather largely to await it. And I grow, I think, small step by small step, physically easier and easier, and seem to know, pretty steadily, more and more where I am.... I have been following you and Alice in imagination to the kind and beautiful Intervale hospitality--my charming taste of which has remained with me ever so gratefully and uneffacedly, please tell the Merrimans when you have another chance. You tell me that Alice and Harry lift all practical burdens from your genius--than which they surely couldn't have a nobler or a more inspiring task;--but what a fate and a fortune yours too--to have an Alice reinforced by a Harry, and a Harry multiplied by an Alice! L'un vaut l'autre--as they appear to me in the wondrous harmony. You don't mention Harry's getting to you at all--but my mind recoils with horror from the thought that he is not in these days getting somewhere. It's a blow to me to learn that Bill is again to hibernate in Boston--but softened by what you so delightfully tell me of your portrait and of the nature and degree of his progress. If he can do much and get on so there, why right he is of course to stay--and most interesting is it to learn that he can do so much; I wish I could see something--and can't your portrait be photographed? But I lately wrote to him appealingly; and he will explain to me all things. Admirable your evocation of the brave and brown and beautiful Peg--of whom I wish I weren't so howlingly deprived. But please tell her I drench her with her old uncle's proudest and fondest affection. I hang tenderly over Aleck--while he, poor boy, hangs so toughly over God knows what--and fervently do I pray for him. And you and Alice I embrace.|$|E

5000|$|With Allies Miller danced a solo called Rain, which {{received}} more favorable reviews than Allies for its innovative movement: Acocella described how Miller, {{wearing a red}} velvet dress, {{lay on her back}} and crawled feet first onto a carpet made of real grass and earth. While critics generally viewed Rain as a blend of Miller's personal vision with social commentary on everything from the environment to African liberation—symbolically, the colors in the piece were black, red, and green—Miller has said that Rain is more of a spiritual journey to the interior than a search for roots. As she told Bromberg, [...] "You're not left with the fact of blackness but the fact of me. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> to do with where I'm going.
