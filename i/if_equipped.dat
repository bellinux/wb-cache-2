5|$|The AH-64E Apache has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches can request to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. UAVs can search for enemies and, <b>if</b> <b>equipped</b> with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The Tavor uses a bullpup configuration, {{in which}} the receiver, bolt carrier group and {{magazine}} are placed behind the pistol grip.

25|$|After {{the train}} has cleared the crossing, the bells (if silenced) may begin ringing again (such as the Florida East Coast Railway), and the gates (<b>if</b> <b>equipped)</b> begin to rise.

Naturally, this would only be available for tracks which exist in real life, there is no information on which or how many circuits in total will support the feature.|$|E
25|$|About 30 {{seconds before}} {{arriving}} at the crossing, the train trips a track circuit near the crossing, triggering the crossing signals. The lights begin to flash alternately, and a bell (or bells) mounted at the crossing begins ringing. After several seconds of flashing lights and ringing bells, the crossing gates (<b>if</b> <b>equipped)</b> begin to lower, which usually takes 5–10 seconds. Some AWDs silence the bell once the gates are fully lowered (typically seen on most Norfolk Southern and CSX crossings); most continue ringing the bells throughout (Union Pacific, BNSF Railway). Some crossings will not sound the bell at all after dark in the case that it is installed near a residential area. The lights continue to flash throughout regardless.|$|E

25|$|The Norden bombsight was {{developed}} {{during a period}} of United States non-interventionism when the dominant U.S. military strategy was the defense of the U.S. and its possessions. A considerable amount of this strategy was based on stopping attempted invasions by sea, both with direct naval power, and starting in the 1930s, with USAAC airpower. Most air forces of the era invested heavily in dive bombers or torpedo bombers for these roles, but these aircraft generally had limited range; long-range strategic reach would require the use of an aircraft carrier. The Army felt the combination of the Norden and B-17 Flying Fortress presented an alternate solution, believing that small formations of B-17s could successfully attack shipping at long distances from the USAAC's widespread bases. The high altitudes the Norden allowed would help increase the range of the aircraft, especially <b>if</b> <b>equipped</b> with a turbocharger, as with each of the four Wright Cyclone 9 radial engines of the B-17.|$|E
25|$|The Predator air {{vehicle and}} sensors are {{controlled}} {{from the ground}} station via a C-band line-of-sight data link or a Ku-band satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 Multi-spectral Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture thermographic camera (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame radar images. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, <b>if</b> <b>equipped.</b>|$|E

The rear seats and rear center armrest pad also folded forward while the trunk divider dropped back, which allowed for generous cargo room. Numerous interior features were exclusive to the Charger including door panels, courtesy lights, as well as premium trim and vinyl upholstery. The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather electroluminescence lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls <b>if</b> <b>equipped.</b> The dash housed a 0 to 6000 rpm tachometer, a 0 to [...] speedometer, as well as alternator, fuel, and temperature gauges as standard equipment.|$|E

2500|$|Several Japanese models {{included}} an All Wheel Drive version (ATTESA). The engines {{used in the}} Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a [...] "redtop" [...] SR20DET (154kW/206hp). This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the Pulsar GTi-R (169kW). It had only a single throttle body as opposed the GTi-R multiple throttle body, smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large top mount intercooler, while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller front mount intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper <b>if</b> <b>equipped</b> with a spoiler.|$|E

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, {{the genius of the}} two men was entirely different.
