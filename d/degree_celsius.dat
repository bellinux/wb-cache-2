5|$|This {{species is}} {{increasingly}} affected by avian malaria, {{the incidence of}} which has tripled in the last 70 years, in parallel with increasing global temperatures.

5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
