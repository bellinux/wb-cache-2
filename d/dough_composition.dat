40|$|Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) {{contents}} {{were evaluated}} in sixty-two commercial digestive and semi-sweet biscuits marketed in Spain. Values ranged from 3. 1 mg·kg- 1 to 182. 5 mg·kg- 1, {{with an average}} of 14. 4 mg·kg- 1 with a huge variability. Influence of <b>dough</b> <b>composition</b> on HMF level was also investigated. Replacing reducing saccharides by saccharide alcohols such as maltitol or lactitol will significantly reduce the formation of HMF during baking. Distribution of HMF in different zones through the biscuit was analysed and, as expected, HMF was heterogenously distributed, with the highest percentage of the compound located in the upper and border sides of the biscuits. This study establishes a dietary exposure of the Spanish population to HMF from biscuits as 2. 3 μg per kg of body weight per day. © 2009 VÚP Food Research Institute. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Currently, glucosylisomaltol (GIM) and galactosylisomaltol (GAI) {{are often}} applied as {{chemical}} markers {{of the extent}} of non-enzymatic browning reaction during different technological processes implying thermal treatment, such as baking or milk sterilisation. GIM and GAI content was evaluated in 62 commercial digestive and semi-sweet biscuits marketed in Spain. An average content of 4. 12 and 7. 42 mg/kg for GIM and GAI is reported in this food commodity, although a huge variability was observed among samples. The influence of <b>dough</b> <b>composition</b> on GIM and GAI level was also investigated. In the case of GIM, fibre decrease its generation, but on the contrary, GAI was favoured through the Maillard reaction in dietetic biscuits due to higher levels of protein related to the addition of fibre. Distribution in different zones (upper, lower, border and middle sides) of the biscuit was investigated, concluding that GIM and GAI are not homogenously formed and the levels increased from the lower side, middle and border to the upper side. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Large {{deformation}} {{rheological properties}} of short <b>doughs</b> of various <b>composition</b> were determined in uniaxial compression. Apart from a sugar-free dough, all doughs studied showed pronounced yielding and flow behaviour. Yielding occurred at very small strain, indicating strong strain dependence. At small strain, systems were predominantly solid-like; at large strain they behaved more like strain-rate thinning liquids. The doughs showed large differences in apparent biaxial extensional viscosity, depending on fat and sucrose contents. It is concluded that yielding behaviour is {{strongly influenced by}} intact flour particles that act as defects in the material. The occurrence of such particles {{is determined by the}} presence of sucrose, which delays gluten development through its effect on solvent quality. The sucrose also facilitates formation of a non-fat continuous phase, since it increases the quantity of solvent. © 1999 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|Large {{deformation}} {{rheological properties}} of short <b>doughs</b> of various <b>composition</b> prepared under various mixing times were determined in uniaxial compression. Sucrose-syrup doughs exhibited prominent yielding and flow behaviour. Their apparent biaxial extensional viscosity decreased with increasing sucrose content. The stress-strain curves for the sugar-free doughs indicated a stronger elastic contribution to deformation {{than did those}} for the sucrose-syrup doughs. The deformability of the former doughs increased with increasing water content. Regardless of dough type, mixing time had a pronounced effect on dough consistency. In addition, it drastically changed {{the shape of the}} stress-strain curve for a sugar-free dough. These results are discussed in terms of the structure of short doughs. It is concluded that sucrose delays, if not inhibits, gluten development and promotes formation of a non-fat continuous phase, whereas mixing promotes formation of a continuous fat phase. © 1999 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|Porous, large surface area, {{metastable}} zirconias, are {{of importance}} to catalytic, electrochemical, biological, and thermal insulation applications. Combustion synthesis is a very commonly used method for producing such zirconias. However, its rapid nature makes control difficult. A simple modification {{has been made to}} traditional solution combustion synthesis to address this problem. It involves the addition of starch to yield a starting mixture with a ``dough-like'' consistency. Just 5 wt% starch is seen to significantly alter the combustion characteristics of the ``dough. '' In particular, it helps to achieve better control over reaction zone temperature that is significantly lower than the one calculated by the adiabatic approximation typically used in self-propagating high-temperature synthesis. The effect of such control is demonstrated by the ability to tune <b>dough</b> <b>composition</b> to yield zirconias with different phase compositions from the relatively elusive ``amorphous'' to monoclinic (> 30 nm grain size) and tetragonal pure zirconia (< 30 nm grain size). The nature of this amorphous phase has been investigated using infrared spectroscopy. Starch content also helps tailor porosity in the final product. Zirconias with an average pore size of about 50 mu m and specific surface area as large as 110 m 2 /g have been obtained...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of oxygen}} during mixing of bread dough was {{investigated}} using a unique air-tight mixer in which oxygen {{content of the}} atmosphere surrounding the dough was fixed at different levels ranging from 10 to 30 %. Effects of the presence in bread <b>dough</b> <b>composition</b> of various O- 2 consumers, such as yeast, lipoxygenase (LOX), and additional glucose oxidase (GOX) and/or soybean or horse bean flour (containing LOX), were studied in order to characterize the competition phenomena for oxygen in the different conditions. O- 2 uptake by dough during mixing was followed and relaxation tests were performed on the resulting bread dough. Variation of O- 2 level of the gaseous atmosphere had no theological impact on basic bread dough (with no additional oxidative system), even though this level was found to {{lead to an increase}} of O- 2 consumption by dough, especially at the beginning of mixing. The competition for O- 2 consumption among yeast, LOX and GOX was decreased by kneading under a 30 % O- 2 atmosphere, enabling GOX to reveal its structuring effect. Finally, mixing bread dough containing GOX under O- 2 -enriched atmosphere enabled keeping a standard dough relaxation index, even though dough water content was increased. This opens new perspectives for improving bread softness...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of food production processes is facilitated by tools which explore {{the interaction between}} process design, operation conditions and product characteristics. In this work an approach how to set-up a simulation model is presented for the phenomena and transformations which occur during baking and which fix the product quality. The simulation model has three consecutive parts: mass and heat transport in the product, transformations concerning starch state transition and color, {{and the formation of}} quality attributes (color, softness, crispness and staling). The model for mass and heat transfer is based on laws of conservation and expressed in partial differential equations for spatial products. The starch state transition and color formation are a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information, while the product quality model is mainly based on qualitative information. The model is applied to three bakery products: bread, biscuit and a cake-type. The results show that the model estimates the product quality and its transformations as a function of <b>dough</b> <b>composition,</b> baking and storage condition. The results fit well to observed changes of properties and product quality during baking. Industrial relevance Food industries require tools to evaluate processing options in the feasibility phase of process design. Therefore, simulation of process models is important for this purpose. However, knowledge of different aspects is subject to area of expertise (for example heat and mass transfer versus product quality formation) and often these areas are hardly connected. This work presents a systematic modeling approach for the dominant processes during baking and their interconnection. The main functions of the model are to explore the consequences of choices in design, to rank design options and to find in what direction properties will change when operational conditions change. Moreover, the model can be used for sensitivity analysis to explore on what items further information must be gathered...|$|E
40|$|International audienceX-ray {{tomography}} is {{a relevant}} technique for the dynamic follow-up of gas bubbles in an opaque viscoelastic matrix, especially using image analysis. It {{has been applied}} here to pieces of fermenting wheat flour <b>dough</b> of various <b>compositions,</b> at two different voxel sizes (15 and 5 mm). The resulting evolution of the main cellular features shows {{that the creation of}} cellular structures follows two regimes that are defined by a characteristic time of connectivity, t(c) [30 and 80 min]: first (t = t(c)) they become connected since the percolation of the gas phase is limited by liquid films. During the first regime, bubbles can be tracked and the local strain rate can be measured. Its values (10 (- 4) - 5 x 10 (- 4) s(- 1)) are in agreement with those computed from dough viscosity and internal gas pressure, both of which depend on the composition. For higher porosity, P = 0. 64 in our case, and thus occurring in the second regime, different cellular structures are obtained and XRT images show deformed gas cells that display complex shapes. The comparison of these images with confocal laser scanning microscopy images suggests the presence of liquid films that separate these cells. The dough can therefore be seen as a three-phase medium: viscoelastic matrix/gas cell/liquid phase. The contributions of the different levels of matter organization can be integrated by defining a capillary number (C-a(*) = 0. 1 - 1) that makes it possible to predict the macroscopic dough behavior...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{high-throughput}} wheat breeding {{techniques have}} resulted in the need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective means to predict tortilla making performance for larger numbers of early generation wheat lines. Currently, the most reliable approach is to process tortillas. This approach is laborious, time consuming, expensive and requires large sample size. This study used a multivariate discriminant analysis to predict tortilla quality using kernel, flour and dough properties. A discriminant rule (suitability = diameter > 165 mm + day 16 flexibility score > 3. 0) was used to classify wheat lines for suitability in making good quality tortillas. One hundred eighty seven hard winter wheat (HWW) varieties from Texas were evaluated for kernel (hardness, diameter, and weight), flour (protein content, fractions and <b>composition),</b> <b>dough</b> (compression force, extensibility and stress relaxation from TA-XT 2 i) and tortilla properties (diameter, rheology and flexibility). The first three principal components explained 58 % of variance. Multivariate normal distribution of the data was determined (Shapiro-Wilk p > 0. 05). PCA identified significant correlation between stress relaxation force and rollability. Canonical correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between kernel and tortilla properties (p? = 0. 75), kernel diameter and weight contributed the highest to this correlation. Flour and tortilla properties were highly correlated (p? = 0. 74). Glutenin to Gliadin ratio (GGratio), IPP and peak time contributed highest to this correlation and can explain > 60 % of variability in tortilla texture (force, distance and work to rupture). The second canonical variate of flour properties is a measure of flour protein content and can explain 26 % of the variability in tortilla rollability. Dough and tortilla properties were significantly correlated (p? = 0. 82, 0. 68, 0. 54, 0. 38 and 0. 29). Dough stress relaxation force after 25 seconds is negatively correlated with tortilla diameter (r = - 0. 73). Kernel hardness, diameter and weight are the best predictors of tortilla texture after 16 days. Glutenin to gliadin ratio and IPP contributed significantly to tortilla texture. This is the first study to identify the contribution of protein content on tortilla rollability score. Dough extensibility can explain 37 % of tortilla rollability. Stress relaxation is the best predictor of tortilla diameter. Tortilla quality variation is attributed to kernel, flour, and dough properties. Logistic regression and stepwise variable selection identified an optimum model comprised of kernel hardness, GGratio, dough extensibility and compression force as the most important variables. Cross-validation indicated 83 % prediction efficiency for the model. This emphasizes the feasibility and practicality of the model using variables that are easily and quickly measured. This is the first model {{that can be used to}} simultaneously predict both tortilla diameter and rollability. It will be a useful tool for the flat bread wheat breeding programs, wheat millers, tortilla processors and wheat marketers in the United States of America...|$|R
40|$|Wheat is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal in the production of a very wide range of products such as bread, cookies, cakes and breakfast cereals. Such different end-products can be obtained by varying the ingredient bill and/or processing conditions (Shewry, 2009). However, not every wheat flour type is equally suited for each application. Therefore, flour quality determination is of great (economical) importance. Adequate flour quality determination is, however, difficult because of the complexity of the system. Indeed, wheat flour contains different constituents that contribute to its properties and the levels and/or functionality of these flour constituents vary between different flour types. The general objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate methods for assessing the quality of European wheat flour. An important focus point was the investigation of the relative value of solvent retention capacity (SRC) test methodologies when compared to more general flour and dough characterization methods for differentiating European flour samples of different bread, cookie and cake making quality. SRC tests are based on quantifying the swelling behavior of flour polymer networks and, hence, their ability to retain a given medium. By doing so, the method relates flour functionality to specific flour constituents. A SRC profile of flour consists of its water retention capacity (WRC), sodium carbonate SRC (SCSRC), sucrose SRC (SuSRC) and lactic acid SRC (LASRC) values. Evidently, the bread, cookie and cake making qualities of a set of European wheat flours were also investigated. In a first experimental part, the SRC readings of a set of 19 European wheat flour samples, used commercially for different end-products, were determined and compared with those from some typical North American wheat flour samples. WRC, SCSRC and LASRC readings were mostly higher than those of some typical North American soft wheat flour samples, but in the range of those of some typical North American hard wheat flour samples. For the SuSRC readings, no distinction could be made between our European flour samples and those of typical North American hard or soft wheat flour samples. In general, based on data in literature of chemical <b>compositions,</b> <b>dough</b> properties and SRC profiles, the 19 European wheat flours appeared better suited for bread making than for cookie or cake making. This was investigated in the second part of the experimental work. Furthermore, it was verified whether the knowledge base relating to SRC tests could be extended to typical European wheat flour. Strong linear relations were observed between flour damaged starch contents and both the WRC and SCSRC readings. Modifying specific flour constituent properties and contents illustrated that proteins, damaged starch and solvent-accessible arabinoxylan contributed to all SRC readings, but each of these flour polymers contributed more to one specific SRC test. Flour proteins, especially the glutenins, contributed mostly to LASRC test results and likely restricted the swelling of damaged starch in the SCSRC test. Damaged starch largely determined the SCSRC reading of flour, but also affected the other three SRC readings. Water-extractable arabinoxylan only contributed to the SuSRC reading, whereas the water-unextractable, but still solvent-accessible arabinoxylan contributed to all SRC readings in general and to the SuSRC reading in particular. In general, the knowledge base relating to SRC tests could be extended to European wheat flour. In a second experimental part, the quality of the European flour samples for the production of three common wheat-based food products in the Western world, namely straight-dough bread, sugar-snap cookies and pound cakes, was assessed. Thereafter, the relative suitability of the SRC tests and more general flour and dough characterization methods to differentiate flour samples of different bread, cookie or cake making quality were evaluated. For bread making, variables related to flour protein content and/or quality were positively related to bread volume. The SRC variables did not show the best correlation with the bread making quality of European wheat flour. However, the LASRC was the test of choice for assessing the bread making quality of flour, especially when the obtained LASRC value was corrected for the contribution of non-glutenin polymers (e. g. damaged starch and arabinoxylan) by dividing the LASRC value by the sum of the SCSRC and SuSRC values. For cookie making, all variables indicative for flour water holding capacity were suitable for assessing cookie making quality of flour. For the current flour sample set, the WRC even correlated better with the cookie diameter than commonly applied methods that measure the amount of water necessary to develop visco-elastic dough. Furthermore, the SuSRC value was negatively related to the dough spread rate during baking. Next to flour water holding capacity, flour protein quality also appeared an important flour quality specification for sugar-snap cookie making. The higher the level of gluten in flour that are unextractable in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing buffer (large gluten proteins), the earlier the cookie dough stopped spreading during baking. For cake making, flour protein content, flour water holding capacity and minimum batter viscosity during baking were positively related to the cake volume which itself is the net result of the oven spring and the collapse that takes place during cake making. The flour proteins had a positive influence on batter viscosity during baking and the quality of the proteins determined the resistance of the crumb structure to collapse. The damaged starch contents were positively related to the oven spring values. The minimum batter viscosity during baking is a useful variable because high viscosities during baking allow the batter to retain expanding gas cells and thereby improve cake volume. For the current flour sample set, especially flour water-extractable arabinoxylan content, but also flour protein and damaged starch contents, contributed to the minimum batter viscosity during baking. All in all, SRC variables were less suitable for assessing the cake making quality of flour. Nevertheless, the SuSRC values were positively related to the minimal batter viscosity during baking. WRC, SCSRC and SuSRC values, which are positively related to flour damaged starch content, were also indicative for the batter expansion during baking. Furthermore, the desired flour characteristics for pound cake making corresponded more to the characteristics desired for straight-dough bread making than those desired for sugar-snap cookie making. Taken together, within the boundaries of our study, we logically assume that the SRC tests are good alternative tests to differentiate European flour samples of different cookie making quality. To a lesser extent, they are useful to differentiate European flour samples of different bread or cake making quality. status: publishe...|$|R
