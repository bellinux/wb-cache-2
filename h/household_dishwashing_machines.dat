40|$|An {{ambitious and}} novel {{approach}} to engineering design and sustainability {{has been taken}} to explore the potential of drawing parallels between mechanical and biological systems for the possible development of sustainable engineering design metrics using a thermodynamic model. This approach looks to biology. Natural selection has given biological beings and processes high exergetic efficiencies, even while being only 30 - 40 % energy efficient on the cell level. This energy inefficiency, resulting in a release of heat, can then be used to aid in driving other biochemical processes. The Gibbs free energy becomes more negative proportionally {{with an increase in}} temperature, resulting in a more favorable reaction. This effective use of waste heat from cell processes actually results in an increase in overall efficiency of an organism, around 50 - 60 %. As in all systems the boundary defines the analysis.

Currently the company is Scandinavian’s leading supplier in its business field. Since 2004, Wexiödisk belongs to an Italian group, called the Ali Group. For being a successful organisation, it is not only necessary to make decisions, but to implement the right ones. Wexiödisk’s present success, as shown in its leading position, can be led back among other things to a number of beneficial decisions. A decision is concerned with the selection of an action often out of a number of alternatives. In order to choose the right one, decision-makers need some guidance, which is partially provided by information gathered by management accounting. Tools used in the management accounting area are consequently considered as a helpful support. Also Wexiödisk focuses on some of these tools, including the costing system, profitability, costing tools and budgeting, which will be presented in this thesis. The costing system contributes to the available knowledge of costs, building the basis for several decisions, like determining prices. Profitability is used especially for decisions concerning discontinuing operations, whereas budgeting deals with the evaluation of investments. These financial information supports decisions made in Wexiödisk. Various decision-making models have been identified in literature to examine this process of decision-making. Out of this pool a sequential model was chosen to illustrate the decision-making steps in Wexiödisk. This model divides the decision-making process into several stages that follow each other. However, it will be illustrated that the decision-making process in Wexiödisk is a bit more complex and cannot be easily squeezed into these steps. It will become apparent in this paper that this process is influenced by many people, making it difficult to determine one final decision-maker as well as a certain decision-making point. Besides, experiences, feelings, preferences and other qualitative factors can have an impact on decisions in Wexiödisk. Nevertheless, financial information affects the decision-making process. In Wexiödisk the role of management accounting information is interwoven and integrated in the whole decision course, having the ability to influence the process at almost every stage...|$|R
30|$|The {{xenobiotic}} compounds benzotriazole (BTri), 5 -tolyltriazole (5 -TTri), and 4 -tolyltriazole (4 -TTri) are polar micropollutants {{commonly used}} as corrosion inhibitors. 4 - and 5 -TTri are commercially available as tolyltriazole mixture (TTri) that {{is widely used}} in metal finishing and as corrosion protection in cooling systems [1, 2]. Among other applications, these three benzotriazole species are mainly used as anticorrosives in aircraft deicing or breaking fluids [3], in <b>household</b> <b>dishwashing</b> detergents for silver protection [4], and as UV stabilizers [5, 6]. Due to an annual production volume of around 9, 000 tons in the USA and probably a much higher global production [7, 8], their widespread usage, high polarity (logP 1.26 and 1.78 for BTri and TTri, respectively), high water solubility, and poor biodegradability, these compounds occur in nearly all aquatic compartments [9 – 12]. This includes ground water with up to 1, 548  ng/L (all three compounds) [13], river systems with up to 7, 997  ng/L for BTri, and 19, 396  ng/L for TTri [14], and the North Sea (up to 40  ng/L, all three benzotriazoles) [15, 16]. Highest concentrations of 128 and 198  mg/L for BTri and TTri, respectively, were detected at a perched water monitoring well at an international airport [17]. Concentrations above 40  mg/L for BTri and 6  mg/L for 5 -TTri show toxic effects in Microtox® tests (Vibrio fischeri light emission as toxicity test system, Azur Environmental, Oceanside, CA, USA) and other organisms [18 – 20]. Thus, benzotriazoles might exhibit detrimental effects on aquatic systems [21]. However, due to their high efficiency in protecting metal surfaces from corrosion, their low costs, and a general low toxicity, these chemicals are frequently used in industrial and household applications [7, 22]. As wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are incapable of completely removing these compounds during the treatment process [6, 23 – 25], WWTP effluents constitute a major point source for benzotriazoles in the receiving rivers. Several workgroups reported different removal efficiencies in conventional WWTP ranging from 13 % to 62 % for BTri, 11 % to 74 % for 5 -TTri, and far less for 4 -TTri [26 – 29]. At laboratory conditions, biological removal of BTri is also incomplete while one study with 5 -TTri showed its biodegradation under aerobic conditions within 91  days [9]. Reported half-lives of BTri and 5 -TTri with 114 and 14  days [9], respectively, are not applicable in WWTP where hydraulic retention times (HRT) are often below 15  h during biological treatment [9]. Therefore, these three compounds are ubiquitous in river water across Europe receiving WWTP effluents [14].|$|R

Recent scientific advancement in cost-effective GW treatment for non-potable reuse (including gardening, irrigation and toilet flushing) suggest that there is a great potential for GW reclamation and reuse in the developing world. However, reclamation and reuse of GW from bathroom/shower sources alone is of particular interest to urban reuse due to its low pollution load and high availability (Jefferson et al. 1999). In addition, GW from kitchen sources is considered to be less favorable for reuse due to its high concentration of pollutant load. This study deals with the characterization of GW to better understand the physical, chemical, microbial and nutrient composition of GW from Indian households. The study also aims to explore various cost-effective treatment options available for point source treatment and reuse.|$|R

In this investigation, we screened the foaming properties (foaming power and foam stability) by a standardized method very similar to the Ross–Miles foaming tests to identify which surfactants are suitable for applications requiring high foaming, or, alternatively, low foaming. The results obtained for the synthesized surfactants are compared to those obtained for an industrial sample of secondary alkanesulfonate (Hostapur 60) and to those of a commercial sample of sodium dodecylsulfate used as reference for anionic surfactants. The foam formation and foam stability of aqueous solutions of the two samples of dodecanesulfonate are compared as a function of their isomeric distribution. These compounds show good foaming power characterized in most cases by metastable or dry foams. The highest foaming power is obtained for the sample rich in primary isomers which also produces foam with a relatively high stability.

40|$|Global {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} {{from the burning}} of fossil fuels stood at a record 8. 38 gigatons of carbon (GtC) in 2006, 20 percent above the level in 2000. Emissions grew 3. 1 percent a year between 2000 and 2006, more than twice the rate of growth during the 1990 s. Carbon dioxide emissions have been growing steadily for 200 years, since fossil fuel burning began on a large scale {{at the start of the}} Industrial Revolution. But the growth in emissions is now accelerating despite unambiguous evidence that carbon dioxide is warming the planet and disrupting ecosystems around the globe. In 2000, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) laid out projections of how greenhouse gas emissions were likely to evolve during the twenty-first century due to economic, demographic, and technological changes. The high-end scenario combined rapid economic growth and globalization with intensive fossil fuel use and was used as the IPCC's upper limit for estimates of future climate change in its recent 2007 report. Yet this upper-limit projection predicted annual emissions growth of only 2. 3 percent between 2000 and 2010 [...] far less than the 3. 1 percent annual increase observed so far this century. With CO 2 emissions currently exceeding the worst-case scenario, we can expect that temperature and sea level rise will likely do the same. Five countries are responsible for over half of fossil-fuel-related CO 2 emissions, and the United States and China alone account for more than a third. The United States has been the world's largest emitter for over a century, releasing 1. 66 GtC in 2006, or 19. 8 percent of global emissions. It is now closely followed by China, where growth in emissions has been driven by a rapid increase in coal consumption [...] China is currently opening an average of two coal-fired power plants a week. Emissions in China have more than doubled since 1990, reaching 1. 48 GtC in 2006, or 17. 7 percent of the world total. Analysts expect that China will overtake the United States to become the world's largest emitter before 2009. The other countries in the top five are Russia, India, and Japan, respectively accounting for 5. 2, 4. 7, and 4. 1 percent of global CO 2 emissions. Of these, India has had the fastest growth in emissions, which have tripled since 1981. The increase in emissions from India and China reflects the rapid industrialization and economic growth currently happening throughout Asia. Since 2000, carbon dioxide emissions in Asia have grown five times faster than emissions in the rest of the world. The region, which produced less then 10 percent of global emissions in 1970, now accounts for almost a third of the world total. These national and regional numbers mask huge differences in per capita CO 2 emissions. After the tiny nations of Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Singapore, the United States has the largest per capita emissions in the world. At 5. 5 tons of carbon, per person U. S. emissions are almost five times greater than those in China, and almost 200 times greater than those in the poorest countries in the world. The United Nations calculates that an average air-conditioner in Florida is responsible for more CO 2 every year than a person in Cambodia is in a lifetime, and that a <b>dishwashing</b> <b>machine</b> in Europe annually emits as much as three Ethiopians. In general, richer countries have higher per capita emissions, but important examples show that emissions do not have to be correlated with standard of living. California, where the average income is well above the U. S. mean, still has per capita emissions just over half the national average. Many countries in Europe also have per capita emissions less than half those in the United States and yet still have a comparable standard of living. Fossil fuel burning is not the only source of carbon dioxide emissions. Currently, roughly 2 gigatons of carbon are released every year as forests are logged for timber or burned to provide agricultural land or pasture. Deforestation is most severe in Indonesia and Brazil, countries with some of the largest remaining stands of tropical rainforest. Together, these two countries account for more than half of emissions from land-use change. Carbon dioxide from both fossil fuel burning and deforestation is accumulating in the atmosphere. Ice core records indicate that there is more CO 2 in the atmosphere now than at any point in the last 650, 000 years. In 2007, the atmospheric CO 2 concentration was 384 parts per million (ppm), up from 280 ppm at the start of the Industrial Revolution. Between 2000 and 2007, atmospheric CO 2 concentration grew by an average of 2 ppm per year, the fastest seven-year increase since continuous monitoring began in 1959. Only about half of the CO 2 released into the atmosphere every year actually remains there, as at least 45 percent is rapidly removed by carbon sinks such as plants and the ocean. As carbon dioxide emissions grow and the planet warms, however, studies suggest that these sinks will begin to saturate and will be unable to continue taking up the same share of emissions. Carbon dioxide is less soluble in a warmer ocean, for example, and warmer soils tend to hold less carbon, so as temperatures rise, a smaller proportion of CO 2 emissions will be taken up by land and ocean sinks. A detailed examination of the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 concentration published in late 2007 suggested that a slowdown in sink uptake may already be occurring [...] much earlier than scientists had anticipated. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide, in combination with other greenhouse gases, have already raised global average temperature by 0. 8 degrees Celsius, with more than two thirds of that increase coming since 1980. This warming is already affecting natural systems around the world: climate scientists have documented trends of more heat waves, longer and more-intense droughts, higher sea level, more-frequent heavy rain events, and stronger hurricanes. Increasing CO 2 levels are also acidifying the ocean, making survival more difficult for organisms such as coral that use calcium carbonate to form their structure. The pH (a measure of acidity where a lower value indicates more acidic conditions) of the surface ocean has already decreased by 0. 1 points and could drop a further 0. 3 - 0. 4 points by 2100 if carbon dioxide emissions are not reduced. This would threaten the existence of organisms that play key roles in the marine ecosystem. The IPCC projects that without policy measures to address global warming, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning could more than double between 2000 and 2030, a trajectory that would make it almost impossible to avoid a temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. Increasing evidence suggests that even a warming of less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures would constitute "dangerous" climate change, something nations have already committed to avoid under the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is clear that to prevent the most serious and irreversible effects of climate change, the world must act swiftly to substantially cut emissions. Energy efficiency measures and existing technologies such as wind power and plug-in hybrid electric cars, combined with programs to protect and restore the world's forests could cut net global carbon dioxide emissions 80 percent by 2020, a goal outlined in Plan B 3. 0 : Mobilizing to Save Civilization by Lester R. Brown. Putting this plan into action would halt and reverse the longstanding trend of growing carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R
