6000|$|... "In one way, {{it looks}} like that, but, after all, a jibe's quite a common thing with a <b>fore-and-after.</b> If you run her off to lee when she's going before it her mainboom's bound to come over. Of course, nobody would run her off in a wicked breeze unless he had to, but you'd no choice with the ice in front of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Dawn! That I did; and the Regulus, and the Manhattan, and the Wilful Girl, and the Deborah-Angelina, and the Sukey and Katy, which, my dear young lady, I may say, was {{my first}} love. She was only a <b>fore-and-after,</b> {{carrying}} no standing topsail, even, and we named her after two of the river girls, who were flyers, in their way; at least, I thought so then; though a man by sailing a packet comes to alter his notions about men and things, or, for that matter, about women and things, too. I got into a category, in that schooner, that I never expect to see equalled; for I was driven ashore to windward in her, which is gibberish to you, my dear young lady, but which Mr. Powis will very well understand, though {{he may not be}} able to explain it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{but so many}} bloody sloops," [...] growled the mate. [...] "Such in-and-in <b>fore-and-afters</b> {{that their}} booms won't stay guyed-out, even after you've been at the pains to use a hawser." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{fleet of}} <b>fore-and-afters</b> at anchor {{has its own}} slender graciousness. The setting of their sails resembles more than {{anything}} else the unfolding of a bird's wings; the facility of their evolutions is a pleasure to the eye. They are birds of the sea, whose swimming is like flying, and resembles more a natural function than the handling of man-invented appliances. The fore- and-aft rig in its simplicity and the beauty of its aspect under every angle of vision is, I believe, unapproachable. A schooner, yawl, or cutter in charge of a capable man seems to handle herself as if endowed with the power of reasoning and the gift of swift execution. One laughs with sheer pleasure at a smart piece of manoeuvring, as at a manifestation of a living creature's quick wit and graceful precision.|$|R
6000|$|... “Promotion {{should go}} {{according}} to length of sarvice,” said the major- domo; “and if-so-be that they ship a hand for my berth, or place a new steward aft, I shall throw up my commission {{in less time}} than you can put a pilot-boat in stays. Thof Squire Dickon “—this was a common misnomer with Benjamin—” is a nice gentleman, and as good a man to sail with as heart could wish, yet I shall tel the squire, d’ye see, in plain English, and that’s my native tongue, that if-so-be he is thinking of putting any Johnny Raw over my head, why, I shall resign. I began forrard, Mistress Prettybones, and worked my way aft, like a man. I was six months aboard a Garnsey lugger, hauling in the slack of the lee-sheet and coiling up rigging. From that I went a few trips in a <b>fore-and-after,</b> in the same trade, which, after all, was but a blind kind of sailing in the dark, where a man larns but little, excepting how to steer by the stars. Well, then, d’ye see, I larnt how a topmast should be slushed, and how a topgallant-sail was to be becketted; and then I did small jobs in the cabin, such as mixing the skipper’s grog. ‘Twas there I got my taste, which, you must have often seen, is excel lent. Well, here’s better acquaintance to us.” Remarkable nodded a return to the compliment, and took a sip of the beverage before her; for, provided it was well sweetened, she had no objection to a small potation now and then, After this observance of courtesy between the worthy couple, the dialogue proceeded.|$|E
5000|$|Alma Doepel {{was built}} in 1903 in Bellingen, NSW, by Frederick Doepel and named after his {{youngest}} daughter Alma. Until 1915 she operated between Sydney and the northern rivers district of New South Wales. In late 1915 she was sold to Tasmanian owners and commenced operation in Tasmania, mainly carrying timber and goods between Hobart and Melbourne. She was fitted with an auxiliary engine in 1916, and again in 1936. In a 1937 refit her rig was simplified from having square topsails on the foremast to having a <b>fore-and-after</b> rig. In 1943 she was requisitioned by the army, refitted and renamed AK82, and used as an army supply vessel running from Townsville and Darwin to Papua New Guinea. After the war she was reverted to merchant vessel configuration, resuming operation in Tasmania in 1946. From 1961 to 1975 she was stripped of her rigging and used to carry limestone, before being sold, for the scrap value of her engines, to the Melbourne company Sail & Adventure in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|The Royal Air Force {{field service}} cap {{is often called}} a forage cap (also known as the chip bag or Thunderbird hat) has no peak and because of its {{longitudinal}} cut is called a [...] "fore-and-after". Its two ornamental buttons at the front can be unfastened in order to let down earflaps for harsh weather. (The German army forage cap of the Second World War was similar, but of two distinct types, one with an eye-shading peak or bill, the other without.) The field service caps worn by group captains and above have additional light blue ("Minerva blue") piping. [...] The field service cap was worn by RAF personnel for everyday purposes from 1936, completely superseding the previously worn peaked cap in December 1939, until about 1950 when it was superseded by the RAF blue beret (introduced after the Second World War) for officers of the RAF Regiment and all other ranks and the SD cap for other officers. RAF field service caps can still be bought privately and worn on duty by all ranks as working dress. They are commonly worn with flying suits, as they are easier to stow in a pocket or cockpit than SD caps, but only air vice-marshals and above are authorised to wear them with combat uniform. [...] The <b>fore-and-after</b> is still worn by airmen in other services, such as the U.S. Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinearities}} {{in human}} body dynamics is discussed {{by focusing on}} the intrinsic (passive) and reflexive (active) dynamics of head-neck complex (HNC). An experiment is first designed to measure the passive responses of HNC to horizontal <b>fore-and-after</b> vibration. The intrinsic frequency response function between the HNC angular velocity and the trunk horizontal acceleration is obtained in the frequency range of 0 : 5 10 Hz. It is shown that nonlinear distortions of the human intrinsic responses to the vibration can be characterized by using frequency domain identification method if the excitation is a non-predictive random. The physical dynamic parameters of human HNC are then obtained and discussed. A second experiment is designed to measure the reflexive dynamics of the head in response to the vibration. The reflexive dynamics of the HNC is also modeled and characterized by using frequency domain identification method. The results suggest that the role of human sensory systems, visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensors, can be modeled by adding linear control elements to the passive HNC model. It is shown that the passive and active dynamics of the HNC can be characterized by utilizing the experiment and analysis for frequency domain. This allows not only reducing the nonlinear distortion of the measured head dynamics but also characterizing the level of nonlinearities...|$|E
