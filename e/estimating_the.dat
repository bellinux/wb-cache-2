5|$|<b>Estimating</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings {{made at the}} times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> {{parameters}} of a distribution from data, the method of maximum likelihood (MLE), can break down in various cases, such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions. In these cases the method of maximum spacing estimation may be successful.|$|E
50|$|The 2002 {{national}} census <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> {{population of}} Kisoro at 11,330. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> population at 12,700 in 2010.

50|$|The 2002 {{national}} population census <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> town's {{population at}} 17,000. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> 2010 population at 21,100. In 2011, UBOS <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> population at 21,700.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} of Nagongera at 9,440. In 2010, UBOS <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> mid-year population at 11,600. In 2011, UBOS <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> population at 11,800.|$|R
5|$|Another way of <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> age of {{the cluster}} is {{by looking at the}} lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly {{destroyed}} in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Estimating</b> <b>the</b> exact rate {{at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> value of a building {{to make sure that}} it meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
50|$|The 2002 {{national}} census <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> town's {{population at}} 5,900. In 2010, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> population at 8,100. In 2011, UBOS <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> population at 8,400 people.|$|R

5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> city's population {{is that part of}} it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{estimated}} {{a demand}} for 1,283 VLA in the following 20 years if airport congestion remains constant, up to 1,771 VLAs if congestion increases, with most deliveries (56%) in Asia-Pacific, and 415 very large, 120-tonne plus freighters. For the same period, Boeing was <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> demand for 590 large (B747 or A380) passenger airliners and 630 freighters.|$|E
5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> parameters of a univariate statistical model. The method requires maximization of the geometric mean of spacings in the data, which are {{the differences between the}} values of the cumulative distribution function at neighbouring data points.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} census in 2002 <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> {{population of}} Kaabong at 13,100. In 2010, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> population at 22,300. In 2011, UBOS <b>estimated</b> <b>the</b> mid-year population at 23,900.|$|R

5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> number of riders who would board the {{system at the}} Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium–thorium dating, uranium–lead dating and uranium–uranium dating. Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets {{in the making of}} high-energy X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running from left to right and depth increasing down the page.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} (in lieu of direct measurements) {{is the fact}} that most of these storms did not threaten land. As Kenna and Patricia were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes. While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to test equipment and conduct research.|$|E
5|$|This {{estimate}} was made {{prior to the}} Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states {{to opt out of}} the Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the related federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the frontiers}} of the Roman Empire, silk became a {{monetary}} standard for <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> value of different products. Hellenistic Greece appreciated the high quality of the Chinese goods and made efforts to plant mulberry trees and breed silkworms in the Mediterranean basin. Sassanid Persia controlled the trade of silk destined for Europe and Byzantium.|$|E

5|$|While other European {{clubs have}} mainly marketed to {{international}} audiences, Bayern {{has focused on}} Germany. Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fifth-most valuable football club in their annual list, <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> club's value at US$1.235billion. As a result of Bayern's finals appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League, the club's brand value has reached US$786million, up 59% from the previous year. Among European teams, this is ahead of Real Madrid's US$600million and behind first-placed Manchester United, whose brand is valued at US$853million. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|The guns in {{the back}} of the {{forecastle}} have defied explanation, but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the aftcastle, aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted. The list of ammunition, small firearms, longbows, arrows, pikes, and bills closely matches the archaeological evidence. As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the Mary Rose, it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> size of the crew.|$|E
