These include a paramacellodid lizard; the turtles Thalassemys sp., Plesiochelys etalloni, and a {{juvenile}} eucryptodiran; plagiaulacid multituberculate, dryolestid, and docodont mammals known from teeth; a diverse actinopterygian <b>fish</b> <b>fauna</b> dominated by Lepidotes sp. but also including Macromesodon sp., Proscinetes sp., Coelodus sp., Macrosemius sp. (or Notagogus sp.), Histionotus sp., Ionoscopus sp., Callopterus sp., Caturus sp., Sauropsis sp., Belonostomus sp., and Thrissops subovatus; and five morphotypes of hybodonts plus the neoselachians Palaeoscyllium sp., two distinct Synechodus sp., and two distinct Asterodermus sp.|$|E
5|$|The fauna {{includes}} {{several species of}} zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is oligotrophic (nutrient-poor), the native <b>fish</b> <b>fauna</b> is relatively scarce, and the only endemics are Rasbora tobana (strictly speaking near-endemic, since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake) and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish. The latter species is threatened by deforestation (causing siltation), pollution, changes in water level and the numerous fish species that have been introduced to the lake. Other native fishes include species such as Aplocheilus panchax, Nemacheilus pfeifferae, Homaloptera gymnogaster, Channa gachua, Channa striata, Clarias batrachus, Barbonymus gonionotus, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Danio albolineatus, Osteochilus vittatus, Puntius binotatus, Rasbora jacobsoni, Tor tambra, Betta imbellis, Betta taeniata and Monopterus albus. Among the many introduced species are Anabas testudineus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Osphronemus goramy, Trichogaster pectoralis, Trichopodus trichopterus, Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii.|$|E
40|$|Aim Assessing the {{consequences}} of a future increase in non-native species introductions and native species extirpations on taxonomic similarity among <b>fish</b> <b>faunas.</b> Location World-wide. Methods We designed 42 scenarios of future species introductions and extirpations to simulate future fish composition for 1054 river basins. Using these simulated future compositions, we computed the change in taxonomic similarity among pairs of <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> from historical to future situation at the river basin, biogeographic realm and world scales. Results According to all our scenarios, taxonomic similarity among <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> will strongly increase in the future at the three spatial scales considered. <b>Fish</b> <b>faunas</b> from the Southern Hemisphere, which are currently the less affected by taxonomic homogenization, are forecasted to show the steepest changes. Our scenarios also reveal that non-native species introductions will account for most of the predicted changes, whereas the effect of native species extirpations will be weak. Main conclusions The predicted future taxonomic homogenization will blur the current high level of taxonomic dissimilarity among freshwater <b>fish</b> <b>faunas,</b> and therefore, imperil the conservation programmes based on beta-diversity mapping...|$|R

5|$|The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as {{vertebrate}} fossils, {{including those}} of dinosaurs, are quite common. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the <b>fish</b> <b>fauna.</b> Mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial Didelphodon. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus {{has been found in}} marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus and Hypacrosaurus. Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and caenagnathids. Intermingled with the Albertosaurus remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod Albertonykus were found. Adult Albertosaurus were the apex predators in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.|$|E

40|$|During the Silurian Period, {{as shown}} here by data from Gotland, Sweden, and {{other regions of}} the Baltoscandian paleocontinent, <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> were struck hard by extinctions caused by the late Ludlow Lau Event, also known for being {{associated}} with the largest positive stable carbon isotope excursion of the Phanerozoic.

25|$|The Patagonian {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> <b>fauna</b> {{is relatively}} restricted {{compared to other}} similar Southern Hemisphere regions. The Argentine part {{is home to a}} total of 29 freshwater fish species; 18 of which are native. The introduced are several species of trout, common carp and various species that originated in more northerly parts of South American. The natives are osmeriforms (Aplochiton and Galaxias), temperate perches (Percichthys), catfish (Diplomystes, Hatcheria and Trichomycterus), Neotropical silversides (Odontesthes) and characiforms (Astyanax, Cheirodon, Gymnocharacinus and Oligosarcus). Other Patagonian freshwater fauna include the highly unusual aeglid crustacean.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>fauna</b> {{was remarkably}} uniform, {{suggesting}} {{that very few}} families survived the Permian extinction. There were also many types of marine reptiles. These included the Sauropterygia, which featured pachypleurosaurus and nothosaurs (both common during the Middle Triassic, especially in the Tethys region), placodonts, and the first plesiosaurs. The first of the lizardlike Thalattosauria (askeptosaurs) and the highly successful ichthyosaurs, which appeared in Early Triassic seas soon diversified, and some eventually developed to huge size during the late Triassic. Subequatorial saurichthyids have also been described in Early Triassic strata.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Examination of the <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> of {{estuaries}} in New Zealand {{suggests that}} they have resident faunas of low diversity. However the estuaries serve as pathways in the migrations of a few marine fish species anj {{a wide range of}} freshwater fish species. For this reason it is important that estuaries remain free from pollution and habitat modification...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the biota and fisheries of estuaries are considered {{in the context of}} a contemporary definition that recognizes the physico-chemical features of the different estuary types found worldwide, i. e. macrotidal v. microtidal and permanently open v. seasonally open v. normally closed. The ways in which fishes use estuaries as a habitat and for feeding and reproduction are categorized and exemplified by fishery-important species from their constituent guilds. Marine species, and particularly their juveniles, dominate the <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> of permanently open estuaries. The prevalence and abundance of species either confined to estuaries or represented by estuarine populations that are discrete from their marine counterparts are far greater in systems that are periodically closed to the sea by sandbars at their mouths. Anthropogenic activities are continuing to have marked effects on estuarine environments and, in extreme circumstances, have had highly deleterious impacts on the <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> and fisheries of these systems...|$|R
50|$|However, {{tetrapod}} {{material in}} the earliest stage of the Carboniferous, the Tournaisian, remains scarce relative to fishes in the same habitats, which can appear in large death assemblages, and is unknown {{until late in the}} stage. <b>Fish</b> <b>faunas</b> from Tournaisian sites around the world are very alike in composition, containing common and ecologically similar species of ray-finned fishes, rhizodont lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians, sharks, and holocephalans.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of non-native fish {{can lead to}} the predation of the native <b>fish</b> <b>fauna</b> or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with ruffe. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example roach, are only at risk for as little as three days.|$|E
25|$|In a 1996 biotic {{assessment}} of upper Searsville Lake {{and the lower}} floodplain of Corte Madera Creek, Stanford biologists wrote that the native species likely included coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), sculpin, California roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), hitch (Lavinia exilcauda), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), and perhaps three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidontus), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). They noted that the only native species observed with any regularity {{in the study area}} are Sacramento sucker and rainbow trout, and attributed the now depauperate native <b>fish</b> <b>fauna</b> to dislocation of hydrologic connectivity due to the dam, transformation of the habitat above the dam from lotic to lentic, and the fact that Searsville Reservoir harbors many non-native species of centrarchid fishes (sunfish, black bass, and crappie) which prey on virtually all historically native fishes. They noted that federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii) occur in the lotic portions of Corte Madera Creek below the dam but not above, likely due to depredation by non-native fish and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus).|$|E

Species-area curves are presented for the <b>fish</b> <b>faunas</b> within both continents. We show that ecological factors statistically explain most of the variation in freshwater fish species richness for both continents. Effects of historical factors are shown to be statistically significant, but add only a little to the variance already explained by ecological factors. Our analyses further indicate that rivers (which flow directly into the ocean) support fewer species of fish than do similarly sized tributaries. The immigration-extinction hypothesis appears to provide a plausible explanation for this observed pattern. The fact that in our final model, a continental effect is still highly significant, leads us not to exclude the possibility of some other historical influences in generating different overall species richness levels on the two continents.
