40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) {{consists}} of {{a high proportion of}} biodegradable matter, which when disposed to landfill decomposes leading to the formation of gas and leachate. Concerns over the environmental impacts of landfill emissions have resulted in efforts to identify alternative management options for MSW. <b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> constitutes a significant fraction of MSW, and its management presents considerable challenges due to its highly putrescible nature and the environmental, public health, and amenity implications. <b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> (FWDs) were introduced to the United States in 1927 as convenient and hygienic means to grind <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> at source and dispose of it directly to the sewer for treatment with wastewater. However, although FWDs are used in many countries throughout the world, their potential as a waste management option has not been fully considered. The authors review existing literature on the potential impacts of FWD use and investigate whether there are sufficient data to ascertain the sustainability of these units. Findings demonstrate that the use of FWDs is effective in reducing the amount of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> disposed of to landfill. However, the impacts of their use on water consumption, sewerage system, and wastewater treatment processes require further investigation before this option can be accepted as a sustainable alternative to landfill. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{treatment}} of increased strength wastewater (WW) {{as a result}} of the use of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> is considered to be an economically viable intervention. This is because of its potential methane generation and the production of reduced amount of sludge at low capital and operational costs. However, the anaerobic treatment performance in cold areas (< 20 oC) is considered to be inefficient, necessitating an additional aerobic biological step to ensure the removal of residual carbon and nutrients. This paper using the GPS-X Hydromantis simulator assesses the potential integration of anaerobic-aerobic treatment processes for enabling the successful {{treatment of}} increased strength WW at low temperatures, using the upflow anaerobic sludge bed high-rate bioreactor. Findings demonstrate that while low temperatures can be a limiting factor to the performance of anaerobic treatment of increased strength WW, the benefits offered by this process over those of the conventional aerobic treatment processes can still be in support of its uptake. Gaining an improved insight into how anaerobic-treatment limitations can be solved from a social, economic and environmental perspective is critical in determining the potential opportunities and threats that this intervention can create. Further research developments should focus on exploring the potential of new technologies and interventions to retain the full value of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and of WW generated, either in the same or separated pathways...|$|R
40|$|The EU Landfill Directive {{requires}} Member States {{to reduce}} the amount of biodegradable waste disposed of to landfill. This has been a key driver for the establishment of new waste management options, particularly in the UK, which in the past relied heavily on landfill for the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW in the UK is managed by Local Authorities, some of which in a less conventional way have been encouraging the installation and use of household <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> (FWDs) as an option to divert <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> from landfill. This study aimed to evaluate the additional burden to water industry operations in the UK associated with this option, compared with the benefits and related savings from the subsequent reductions in MSW collection and disposal. A simple economic analysis was undertaken for different FWD uptake scenarios, using the Anglian Region as a case study. Results demonstrated that the significant savings from waste collection arising from a large-scale uptake of FWDs would outweigh the costs associated with the impacts to the water industry. However, in the case of a low uptake, such savings would not be enough to cover the increased costs associated with the wastewater provision. As a result, this study highlights the need for policy intervention in terms of regulating the use of FWDs, either promoting them as an alternative to landfill to increase savings from waste management, or banning them as a threat to wastewater operations to reduce potential costs to the water industry...|$|R
40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> {{management}} is currently attracting both regulatory and public attention due to new {{greenhouse gas emission}} targets, targets relating to waste reuse, recycling and the diversion of waste from landfill, {{as well as other}} policies related to sustainability. The research presented in this thesis addressed two of the management options currently available namely the use of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> (FWDs) and the anaerobic co-digestion of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> with sewage sludge, because of their relevance to the water industry. The use of FWDs was studied and results demonstrated that they can bring substantial benefits to local authorities through reductions in cost from waste collection, but can also present challenges to the water industry due to the need to treat additional wastewater. Policy implications were identified, and given the prospect of FWDs application, the incorporation of anaerobic treatment processes into municipal wastewater treatment operations was investigated as a viable technology which could be implemented to give environmental and economic benefits independent of the prevailing climatic conditions. The anaerobic co-digestion of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> with sewage sludge, well-established in other European countries but still in its infancy in the UK, was investigated as an alternative <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management option. With sustainability becoming a driver for change in waste management practices, this option was found to have considerable potential, but significant capital investment and operational expenditure could be required to create new assets or upgrade existing ones. A multi-criteria framework was developed to support decision-making aim to select the appropriate <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management option based on sustainability. It was concluded that diverting <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> from landfill is not only a challenge, but an opportunity that can lead to more sustainable solutions. Balancing the relationship between water, food and energy is the real means to viable solutions and the ultimate approach to deliver overall benefits.

Through comparing the amount of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> between 12 apartment complexes with the RHWC policy (treatment group) and 61 apartment complexes (control group) without the policy, we attempt to identify whether the RHWC can contribute in reducing <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> In June 2013, all these apartment complexes adopted an apartment complex unit-based food-waste system (i. e., Community-Based Waste Charging system-CWC), but, in January 2016, the 12 apartment complexes introduced the RHWC policy, while the other 61 apartment complexes kept the CWC policy. This natural experiment setting allows us to compare the difference in the quantity of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> between these two payment policies. The RHWC uses a weight based payment design, through which each household is electronically charged for the weight of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> they disposes, while the CWC uses a group incentive system where residents pay the same price by dividing total amount of waste charge by total number of household in apartment complex.

Results of the assessment are applicable to disposal of low-level radioactive waste (LLW), uranium mill tailings, hazardous waste, and sanitary landfills. Three kinds of <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>unit</b> covers or barriers to water infiltration are being investigated: (1) resistive layer barrier, (2) conductive layer barrier, and (3) bioengineering management. The resistive layer barrier consists of compacted earthen material (e. g., clay). The conductive layer barrier consists of a conductive layer {{in conjunction with a}} capillary break. As long as unsaturated flow conditions are maintained, the conductive layer will wick water around the capillary break. Below-grade layered covers such as (1) and (2) will fail if there is appreciable subsidence of the cover, and remedial action for this kind of failure will be difficult. A surface cover, called bioengineering management, is meant to overcome this problem. The bioengineering management surface barrier is easily repairable if damaged by subsidence; therefore, it could be the system of choice under active subsidence conditions. The bioengineering management procedure also {{has been shown to be}} effective in dewatering saturated trenches and could be used for remedial action efforts.
