A small airfield, Wellingore Heath, was opened on land bordering Navenby in 1917, to provide a base for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service.

Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an <b>ideal</b> <b>situation</b> it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E

50|$|An <b>ideal</b> speech <b>situation</b> was a term {{introduced}} in the early philosophy of Jürgen Habermas. It argues that an <b>ideal</b> speech <b>situation</b> is found when communication between individuals is governed by basic, implied rules.

Furthermore, all participants would be motivated solely by the desire to obtain a rational consensus.|$|R
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an <b>ideal</b> <b>situation,</b> the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E

The general approach for fluorescent sensors is {{to attach the}} protein to one extremity of an optic fibre implanted under the skin whilst the other extremity {{is connected to the}} detection subsystem, which includes a path splitter (sliced fibre or dichroic mirror) to allow the fibre to transmit both the excitation and the emitted light, a filtered light source (in general, a laser), and a filtered photodetector (a CCD or a PMT). The information thus collected is then analysed with a computer.|$|E

In 1925, aircraft builder Donald Douglas and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler worked together with Caltech president Robert Millikan to bring a state-of-the-art aeronautical research laboratory to the Pasadena college. Douglas recruited some of Caltech's best and brightest students for his company. Douglas utilized the lab's wind tunnel and research staff while designing his DC-1, 2, and 3. In this way, the DC-3, undoubtedly {{one of the most}} successful aircraft designs ever built, represented more than just a single designer's project. It was a regional product, the result of an alliance of business and science created over the preceding five decades.|$|E

25|$|As {{sugar levels}} in the grape rise, acid levels fall. All wines need some degree of acidity {{in order to be}} {{balanced}} and avoid tasting flabby or dull. Acidity is also a key component in food and wine pairing so its presence in wine is important with winemakers trying to harvest grapes before acid levels fall too low. The stress to maintain acid levels is not as bearing {{due to the fact that}} winemakers can rectify the situation somewhat by later adding acids during the winemaking process (winemakers can also rectify deficiencies in sugar levels by chaptalization). However natural acids in the grape play other roles in the development of flavor and aroma compounds as well as fighting against the effects of spoilage organisms so the most <b>ideal</b> <b>situation</b> for winemakers is to try and harvest while acid levels are acceptable.|$|E

In these <b>ideal</b> <b>situations,</b> close mobiles can transmit/receive 6 bits per RU while far mobiles may transmit/receive 4 [*]bits per RU. If the scheduler always allocated the RUs to the mobiles in these <b>ideal</b> <b>situations,</b> an overall efficiency of 5 [*]bits per RU would be obtained which yields a theoretical maximal system throughput of 1600 [*]Kbps. Comparing this value to the highest traffic load in Figure 11 (a) (1280 [*]Kbps) further demonstrates the good efficiency obtained with the opportunistic schedulers that nearly always serve the mobiles when their channel conditions are very good. This result also shows that the WFO scheduling has slightly better performances than the two other opportunistic schedulers. Keeping more mobiles active (cf. Figure 11 (b)) but with a relatively lower traffic backlog (cf. Figure 8 (a)), the WFO scheme preserves multiuser diversity and takes more advantage of it obtaining a slightly higher bit rate per subcarrier (cf. Figure 11 (a)).|$|R

The report also notes that Mrs. Hayden was unknown to the commissioners and despite the land having significant liabilities was waiting to become a state park by 1930. The delay in its transformation stemmed from a request that William Brainerd, one of Selden and Harriet's sons, have life use of the property. William Brainerd died in 1936 and the terms of the will were completed. At a later date, the State of Connecticut dismantled the buildings and established the Brainard Homestead State Park.|$|E
