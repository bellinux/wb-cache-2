Though no further regular season games were moved, the finals series hosted by the Aces was held at La Trobe University as well.|$|E
5|$|Going Clear was {{released}} in {{a limited number of}} theaters on March 13, 2015, and aired on HBO on March 29, 2015. It was a major ratings success and by mid-April 2015 <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> 5.5 million viewers, making it the second most-watched HBO documentary in the past decade.

5|$|In November 2009, a local street, Durant Avenue, {{was renamed}} to Detective Russel Timoshenko Way in the detective's honor. Incidentally, {{following}} the controversial decision to rename a street to Sean Bell Way for police shooting victim Sean Bell, some community members had recommended {{doing the same}} for Timoshenko. However, the latter case <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> much less media attention.|$|E

By {{the time of his}} death fourteen years later, he <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present.|$|E
5|$|Life is Worth Living was not {{the only}} DuMont program to achieve double-digit ratings. In 1952, Time {{magazine}} reported that popular DuMont game show Down You Go <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> an audience estimated at 16 million viewers. Similarly, DuMont's summer 1954 replacement series, The Goldbergs, achieved audiences estimated at 10 million. Still, these series were only moderately popular compared to NBC's and CBS's highest-rated programs.|$|E
5|$|Orcinus orca is {{the only}} {{recognized}} extant species in the genus Orcinus, one of many animal species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in Systema Naturae. Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his Piscium & aquatilium animantium natura of 1558, {{part of the larger}} Historia animalium, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> a great deal of local interest.|$|E

5|$|Robson's {{success with}} Ipswich <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> the {{attention}} of many bigger clubs, {{and he had been}} linked with the Manchester United job when Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to Ron Atkinson instead. It was the Football Association who lured Robson away from Portman Road a year later, when he accepted their offer to manage the England national team in July 1982.|$|E
5|$|StG 77 {{was also}} in action, escorted by JG 27 Bf 109s. StG 77s 52 Ju 87s were joined by 40 Ju 88s of KG 54. Both {{formations}} were heading for No. 10 Group RAF's airfields. StG 77 was targeting RAF Warmwell. The Geschwader failed to find its target, dropping its bombs at random. The other Ju 87 units <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> much attention and StG 77 escaped unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|The Cup Series {{was started}} in 1949, with Jim Roper winning the first series. By 2008, the most prestigious race in the series, the Daytona 500 <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> more than 17 million {{television}} viewers. Dynasties {{were born in the}} 1950s with racers like Lee Petty (father of Richard Petty, grandfather of Kyle Petty) and Buck Baker (father of Buddy Baker).|$|E
50|$|Rocamadour <b>has</b> <b>attracted</b> {{visitors}} for its {{setting in}} a gorge above {{a tributary of}} the River Dordogne, and especially for its historical monuments and its sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which for centuries <b>has</b> <b>attracted</b> pilgrims from many countries, among them kings, bishops, and nobles.|$|R

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad had preached the {{religion}} of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622. He <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition {{from the rest of}} the Quraysh, the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as Yathrib; Medina means City). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to Damascus which the Muslims intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.|$|E
5|$|Other {{government}} {{decisions in}} 1929 <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> controversy as well. Page handed down his last budget on 22 August, which hinted at the burgeoning debt crisis and {{introduced a new}} tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover the deficit. The tax was very unpopular with the public, and the entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it. Bruce, supported by the Brigden Report of 1929, also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with the powerful protected industries.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} {{of the first half of}} 1876, Sitting Bull's camp {{continually}} expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} {{collectible}} cars collapsed {{as a result}} of the recession over the six-year period from 1989–94; for example, a highly collectible Ferrari 250 GTO sold for just $3.5 million in 1994, an $11.1 million loss from its sale price in 1989. The Jaguar XJ220 <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} against the government of Porfirio Díaz broke out in late 1910, after Díaz had his rival Francisco Madero imprisoned and had announced his own victory in a falsified election. Madero's earlier vague promises of agrarian reforms <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> many supporters. He himself escaped from prison and fled to Texas, from where he issued his famous Plan of San Luis Potosí. This manifesto called for an armed uprising against the Porfiriato and establishment of free and democratic elections. As a response to Madero's proclamation, violent clashes began throughout Mexico in November 1910.|$|E

5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case <b>had</b> <b>attracted</b> {{a great deal of}} {{attention}} in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
