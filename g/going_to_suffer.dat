2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut {{and it was just}} a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson to you and to all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Jordan Grand Prix F1 team {{principal}} Eddie Jordan {{believed that}} the departure of Briatore and Symonds from Renault on 16 September was an effective admission of guilt. Former three-time Formula One World Champion and former team owner Sir Jackie Stewart said of the Singapore scandal that [...] "There is something fundamentally rotten and wrong {{at the heart of}} Formula One. Never in my experience has Formula One been in such a mood of self-destruction. Millions of fans are amazed, if not disgusted, at a sport which now goes from crisis to crisis with everyone blaming everyone else." [...] Former three-time Formula One World Champion and former Jaguar Racing team manager Niki Lauda, while comparing the Singapore incident to the 2007 espionage scandal declared that [...] "This , though, is new. The biggest damage ever. Now the FIA must punish Renault heavily to restore credibility in the sport." [...] Former 1996 F1 World Champion Damon Hill described the Singapore crash as [...] "not a very good episode" [...] for the sport and said of the future of F1 that [...] "I'm concerned the sport is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> as a genuine challenge, which is what I always felt it should be and would like it to be, of skill and competitiveness". Former racing driver Eddie Irvine, who retired from Formula One at the end of 2002, {{believed that the}} response to the Singapore incident had been an overreaction, stating that [...] "This [...] is probably slightly {{on the wrong side of}} the cheating thing but in days past every team have done whatever they could to win – cheat, bend the rules, break the rules, sabotage opponents", [...] "his is just the FIA going on a crusade". He also speculated that the FIA would be lenient on Renault F1 and not expel them, due to the sport's current [...] "shaky" [...] condition after recent team departures.|$|E

[...] According to Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine, the game [...] "blends the stuff of nightmares with stylish sound and graphics. Sadly, the developer should have spent longer on the gameplay." [...] Edge found neither plot nor gameplay appealing: [...] "It’s just a murky brew of meaningless, exploitative dysfunction filling an empty game, and it leaves a bitter taste." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Atherothrombosis, ischaemic {{heart disease}} (IHD), {{cerebrovascular}} disease (CVD) and peripheral arterial dis-ease (PAD) {{are a major}} cause of mortality and are predicted to be {{the leading cause of death}} world-wide by 2020. It is now recognised that CVD is part of a family of atherothrombotic diseases such as PAD and IHD. However, despite receiving contemporary evidence-based preventative drug therapy, patients with established arterial disease and those with multiple risk factors for atherothrombosis both experience high cardiovascular (CV) event rates with a 4. 7 % yearly rate of hard events. People with symptomatic atherosclerosis in 1 vascular bed are at a higher risk of subsequent events in other beds, e. g. patients who suffer a stroke are at a high risk of <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> a coronary event, with a 10 year CV event risk of 42. 8 %. These findings support the need for increased awareness among physicians and patients for the amount of vascular cross-risk that is related to the overlap between the various beds of atherothrombosis. Atherothrombosis in stroke patients should be considered as a global arterial disease. We present a systematic review of the literature relating to the risk of non-cerebral (especially sub-clinical) atherothrombotic events in ischaemic stroke pa-tients...|$|R

He could hurt her. He had power over her. What a pang shot through his heart! There would be an irresistible delight in playing on the emotions of this woman. He could no more help it than the shame that surged over him at consciousness of his littleness.

40|$|Given {{the failure}} of many peace-building {{operations}} to ensure a sustainable peace, it is perhaps {{not surprising that the}} prospect of retaliatory violence in post-conflict societies is frequently identified as a security and development concern. Drawing on a critique of the so-called &# 039;therapeutic security paradigm&# 039;, this paper critically examines discourses of traumatization in TimorLeste. At one level, it is noted that the bio-psychological model of &# 039;trauma&# 039; can be incongruous with East Timorese notions of health, widely understood as being socially embedded and relational, rather than biological and individual. On another, the paper argues that there is no one-to-one correlation between experiencing events that might be classified as &# 039;traumatic&# 039; and <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> a pathological traumatization. Individual and community resilience should not be underestimated, and the rationale for international supervision of &# 039;traumatized&# 039; societies should be questioned. Therapeutic interventions, such as the East Timorese Commission for Truth and Reconciliation, may be a pragmatic option given the lack of international support for pursuing criminal justice or financial reparations. However, remedies aimed at the psyche that {{come at the expense of}} the material may pose a greater threat to sustainable and secure community than does pathological traumatization, particularly at this time of acute social change...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} all-IP {{mobile network}} infrastructures based on 3 rd Generation IP Multimedia Subsystem philosophy are characterised by radio access technology independence and ubiquitous connectivity for mobile users. Currently, great focus is being devoted to security issues {{since most of}} the security threats presently affecting the public Internet domain, and the upcoming ones as well, are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>suffered</b> by mobile users in the years to come. While a great deal of research activity, together with standardisation efforts and experimentations, is carried out on mechanisms for signalling protection, very few integrated frameworks for real-time multimedia data protection have been proposed in a context of IP Multimedia Subsystem, and even fewer experimental results based on testbeds are available. In this paper, after a general overview of the security issues arising in an advanced IP Multimedia Subsystem scenario, a comprehensive infrastructure for real-time multimedia data protection, based on the adoption of the Secure Real-Time Protocol, is proposed; then, the development of a testbed incorporating such functionalities, including mechanisms for key management and cryptographic context transfer, and allowing the setup of Secure Real-Time Protocol sessions is presented; finally, experimental results are provided together with quantitative assessments and comparisons of system performances for audio sessions with and without the adoption of the Secure Real-Time Protocol framework...|$|R
