5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery,</b> and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery,</b> and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E

Against the Washington Capitals on November 28, Horton along with teammates Olli Jokinen, Kamil Kreps and Stephen Weiss scored shootout goals to help Florida win the game. For {{the first time since}} March 2007, Horton scored 2 goals in a game to help the Panthers win over the Atlanta Thrashers on December 28. Horton and linemate David Booth combined for three goals against the New York Islanders, of which Horton scored two.

Horton scored against Vancouver Canucks goalie and former Panther Roberto Luongo in a shootout to help the Panthers win 43, giving them their first win over Vancouver since 1999. Horton scored a goal against the Washington Capitals to help Florida win 42 in the game after Richard Zednik suffered a neck injury in which he had his <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> cut by a skate.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{intraoperative}} use of a new angle-independent ultrasound scan device (EchoFlow [EF]) in measurement of <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> velocities after endarterectomy. Specifically, the purpose was to determine the reproducibility of velocity measurements obtained with EF and to compare these measurements with the velocity measurements obtained with duplex ultrasound scan. Methods: Velocity measurements of the common, internal, and <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> were performed by the operative surgeon with EF in 65 consecutive patients after carotid endarterectomy (36 female, 29 male; mean age, 71 years). Three velocity measurements were obtained from each of the arteries with EF and compared with the velocity measurements obtained with duplex ultrasound scan performed by a radiologist. Results: Velocity measurements obtained with the EF device were reproducible in the common, internal, and <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (intrapatient correlation coefficients, 0. 95, 0. 96, and 0. 95, respectively). Seventy-five percent of common, 88 % of internal, and 78 % of <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> velocity measurements obtained with the angle-independent ultrasound scan device were within 25 cm/s of the velocities measured with duplex ultrasound scan. The mean differences in velocity measurements between EF and duplex scan were − 12 cm/s in the common, − 8 cm/s in the internal, and − 11 cm/s in the <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> Differences between the EF device and duplex scan velocity measurements correlated with increasing arterial velocities in each of the three arteries measured (P <. 05). Conclusion: Reproducible measurements of <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> velocity may be obtained with a new angle-independent Doppler system after endarterectomy. Most measurements obtained with the EF system are clinically comparable with those obtained with standard duplex ultrasound scan. This novel low-cost device may be useful in the intraoperative assessment of hemodynamic adequacy of carotid endarterectomy. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 374 - 80. ...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral {{constriction}} of the carotid sinus area, {{the immediate}} arterial {{branches of the}} sinus, or (perhaps) the vertebral arteries, and bilateral resection of the carotid sinus produces a significant, persistent hypertension in dogs, the highest levels occurring in the carotid sinus area constricted dogs. Pathogenesis is still unsettled. IN. 1954 our research group reported thatmodest to high level, persistent hyperten-sions could be produced in dogs by bilateral constriction of the carotid sinus area {{by means of a}} plastic clamp which reduced the volume pulse of the sinus and the internal <b>carotid,</b> occipital, and <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> to ap-proximately one third normal. 1 This report suggested that the hypertension was probably not due to altered carotid sinus function but to altered cerebral hemodynamics.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Revascularization of the {{internal}} or <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> is occasionally indicated for symptomatic atherosclerotic common <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion or long-segment high-grade stenosis beginning at its origin. I report the outcome of axillary artery-based bypass grafts to the distal common, internal, or <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> Methods: Between 1981 and 1997, 29 axillary-to-carotid bypass grafting procedures were performed on 28 patients, 15 men and 13 women, {{with a mean age}} of 68 years. Indications were transient ischemia in nine patients, amaurosis fugax in four patients, completed stroke in six patients, and nonlateralizing global ischemia in nine patients. Twenty-three common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> were totally occluded, and six had long-segment stenosis of 90 % or greater beginning at the origin. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 25 procedures, and synthetic grafts were used in four. Grafts were placed to 13 internal, eight distal common, and eight <b>external</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> Results: There were no perioperative deaths; one stroke occurred (3. 4 %). No lymphatic or peripheral nerve complications occurred. In a 1 - to 11 -year follow-up period (mean, 4. 5 years), there were no graft occlusions, one restenosis of 50 % or greater, and two restenoses of 70 % or greater. The 1 -year stenosis-free rate for 50 % or greater stenosis was 93 %, and the 5 - and 10 -year rates were 87 %. No late ipsilateral strokes occurred. The 5 - and 10 -year survival rates were 64 % and 28 %, respectively. Coronary artery disease was the major cause of late mortality. Conclusion: Axillary-to-carotid bypass grafting for severe symptomatic common carotid occlusive disease is safe, well tolerated, durable, and effective in stroke prevention. There is a high late mortality rate because of coronary artery disease in patients with severe proximal common carotid occlusive disease. (J Vasc Surg 1999; 30 : 1106 - 12. ...|$|R
