5000|$|The portal gear {{configuration}} is {{also sometimes}} called a <b>drop</b> <b>gear</b> or drop gearset configuration (which, despite its similarity {{to the term}} dropped axle, produces the opposite effect).|$|E
50|$|A {{change was}} made to the <b>drop</b> <b>gear</b> ratio {{compared}} to the previous year's event, where cars were reaching the rev limiter on the main straight. The ratio change was aimed {{to reduce the amount}} of time that cars spent on the limiter, lessening the risk of damage to the drivetrain. Overtaking at the first corner was made easier, as the top speed of the cars on the main straight was no longer restricted by the limiter.|$|E
50|$|The Harbour Trust boats Commissioner and Customs No. 1 had {{two sets}} of torpedo <b>dropping</b> <b>gear</b> fitted to each boat thereby adding two more torpedo boats to the fleet. In 1885 the {{government}} steamers Lion and Spray were fitted with six-pounder Armstrong guns. Spray was later fitted with {{two sets of}} torpedo <b>dropping</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gordon {{was armed}} with three 1-inch Nordenfelt guns and carried {{two sets of}} <b>dropping</b> <b>gear</b> for Whitehead torpedoes. She was manned by 11 men.|$|R
25|$|The WC was {{the first}} farm tractor to have rubber tires as {{standard}} equipment, and the first tractor tested on rubber in the Nebraska tractor tests. The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a steel wheel with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping {{the cost of the}} tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC <b>drop</b> <b>gearing</b> at the rear (bull-gear-with-pinion final drives), which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter drive wheels. <b>Drop</b> <b>gearing</b> had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|R
5000|$|The 'portal' {{type design}} of {{the front and rear}} axles means that the centre of the axle is above the centre of the wheel, thus {{increasing}} ground clearance under the axle without the need to increase the wheel diameter. Power is transmitted from the axle to the wheel via <b>drop</b> <b>gears</b> in each wheel hub.|$|R
50|$|The spar torpedoes were {{replaced}} with Whitehead mobile torpedoes, {{which could be}} launched from the torpedo boats by means of <b>dropping</b> <b>gear</b> amidships. However the narrow hull remained stable only if both torpedoes were dropped simultaneously. There was no question of flotilla tactics, since the four harbours were too far apart. Rather, each boat was a single shot weapon, but integrated into the overall defence plan for each harbour.|$|R
25|$|Power is {{transferred}} from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the final drive ratio are fixed with <b>drop</b> <b>gears</b> {{at the front of}} the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple plate clutch. The cars run on E85 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of 112 litres.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{formation}} of the Queensland Maritime Defence Force the colonial government decided to supplement the recently acquired vessels with a small torpedo launch. HMQS Midge was specifically built in England by J. Samuel White, Cowes, for this purpose and shipped out to Australia in 1887. She was of wooden construction using a combination of teak and mahogany, and cost 5,000 pounds sterling. Displacing 12 tons, she was [...] long, had a [...] beam and a draught of [...] The ship was armed with one 3-pounder gun and two machine guns. Originally she carried one spar torpedo and later had two sets of <b>dropping</b> <b>gear</b> for 14 inch torpedoes.|$|R
5000|$|GM {{versions}} are passenger side differential <b>drop,</b> standard rotation <b>gears,</b> kingpin knuckles and 35 spline axle shafts.|$|R
50|$|Constructed by Thornycroft of Chiswick, HMQS Mosquito was {{launched}} on 16 July 1884, having been before being completed in 1885. With a gavanised steel hull, she was designed {{with a top}} speed of 21 knots; however, was only able to achieve 17.21 knots during trials. The ship was built to a standard design; TB 191 of Tasmania and the New Zealand Defender-class torpedo boats were identical. Lonsdale and Nepean of Victoria, built in 1883-1884, were also identical, except in mounting fixed torpedo tubes. Displacing 12 tons, she was 63 ft long, and had a 7.5 ft beam. She had a complement of seven and was equipped with two sets of <b>dropping</b> <b>gear</b> for 14-inch torpedoes. Construction cost 3,500 pounds sterling.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{versions}} are driver's side differential <b>drop,</b> reverse-cut <b>gears,</b> and kingpin knuckles up to 1991. The later axles have ball joints. Ford Dana 60 axles mostly feature 35 spline inner axle shafts, {{but some are}} 30 spline. Larger brakes and 35 spline outer shafts were made standard in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The skipper {{then comes}} {{up with the idea}} to try to hide the tour boat in a nearby {{boathouse}} and wait for Chief Brody's arrival. As the skipper brings the tour boat to a stop inside the boathouse and looks for somewhere to tie it up, a sound is heard somewhere near the back of the boathouse. As the stressed skipper tries {{to figure out what it}} was, a loud crashing noise breaks the silence as the walls of the boathouse begin to shake. The skipper realizes that the shark is ramming itself into the outside of the boathouse trying to break in. The skipper tries to drive off, but is unable to get the tour boat to <b>drop</b> into <b>gear.</b> After several seconds of fighting with the tour boat's throttle, the skipper finally gets it to <b>drop</b> into <b>gear</b> just as the shark finally breaks a hole through the wall and surfaces inside of the boathouse, grazing the side of the tour boat.|$|R
50|$|The Curve di Lesmo are two corners {{that are}} not {{as fast as they}} used to be, but are still {{challenging}} corners. The first is blind, entered at 264 km/h in fifth <b>gear,</b> <b>dropping</b> to fourth <b>gear</b> at 193 km/h, and has a slight banking. The second is a fifth gear entry at 260 km/h, apexing in third gear at 178 km/h, and {{it is very important that}} all the kerb is used. A mistake at one of these corners will result either in a spin into the gravel or an overtaking move into Variante Ascari.|$|R
25|$|A B-17G {{operated}} by Intermountain Airlines, an actual Central Intelligence Agency front company, fitted with the Fulton recovery system, <b>drops</b> rescue <b>gear</b> to James Bond and his Bond {{girl in the}} Bahamas {{at the conclusion of}} the 1965 film Thunderball. This aircraft had actually been used by the CIA to insert and recover agents in the Arctic that had checked on an abandoned Soviet ice station under Project COLDFEET in 1963.|$|R
25|$|The British naval {{mission to}} Serbia was {{intended}} to support Serbian efforts to resist the Austro-Hungarian flotilla, consisting of monitors and patrol vessels, operating on the Danube. For this task Troubridge commanded {{a small group of}} seaman and marines armed with eight 4.7 inch naval guns. They were later reinforced with a 45-foot picket boat fitted with torpedo <b>dropping</b> <b>gear.</b> Allied control of the Danube became strategically vital after the Gallipoli Campaign began, as it prevented river-borne supplies from reaching the Black Sea, from where they could be transported to Turkey. Despite initial success in preventing Austro-Hungarian domination of the waterway, the entry of Bulgaria to the war and the combined Austrian-German-Bulgarian offensive in October caused the disintegration of the Serbian position. Troubridge and his force retreated with the Serbian army to the Adriatic coast, reaching the small port of San Giovanni di Medua. Troubridge took command of the evacuation and oversaw the withdrawal of the remains of the army and many thousands of refugees to Corfu throughout December and January.|$|R
500|$|Robinson volunteered in April for an {{even more}} {{dangerous}} mission, following the Turkish capture of [...] submarine HMS E15 which had stranded below the guns of Fort Dardanus near Kepez Point. All efforts to destroy this craft had so far failed and it was considered vital for naval morale {{that it was not}} salvaged by the enemy. Robinson took command of two picket boats from the battleships [...] and , each armed with two torpedoes mounted on the gunwales in <b>dropping</b> <b>gear,</b> and entered the Dardanelles under cover of darkness on 18 April. Caught in a blaze of searchlights, and under heavy fire from the Turkish artillery and machine guns, both boats miraculously arrived unscathed. A carelessly-directed Turkish searchlight briefly illuminated E15. The boat from HMS Majestic under the command of Lt Goodwin seized the opportunity and attacked. The first torpedo missed, and seconds later the boat was struck by a shell that blew away much of her stern, mortally wounding one of her crew and causing her irreparable damage. Undeterred, Goodwin went in again and scored a direct hit with his second torpedo, just forward of the conning tower, wrecking the submarine.|$|R
5000|$|After the midair {{explosion}} of the Space Shuttle [...] "Challenger" [...] in 1986, the 106th Rescue Wing was designated to provide support for every shuttle launch thereafter. In October 1991, an HH-60 and a tanker flew to an endangered sailboat about 250 miles south of its base. The Pave Hawk and HC-130 <b>dropped</b> survival <b>gear</b> to the vessel, which was riding out the storm, and began their return to base. Both aircraft encountered severe weather conditions and the helicopter was unable to take on fuel.|$|R
5000|$|Dodge {{versions}} were {{passenger side}} differential <b>drop,</b> standard rotation <b>gears,</b> kingpin knuckles and 35 spline axle shafts in early models. The 2nd Generation axles were driver's side with ball joints. 30 spline axle shafts were {{used instead of}} 35 splines, except 2000, 2001 and 2002 models which were equipped with 32 spline axle shafts.|$|R
5000|$|Following the Inside Edition investigation, many {{magazines}} also {{focused on}} the team and their extreme stunt riding. One crew member is quoted saying [...] "Most normal people pull over when they see lights or hear sirens, we immediately <b>drop</b> a <b>gear</b> and hammer it. There isn’t a police car out there that {{can keep up with}} these bikes, so it’s a no-brainier. You have to constantly scan for police. If you see one, run the other way regardless - don’t wait for them to find a reason to pull you over. The police are here to f--k you over, so whey give them the chance?” ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{deals with}} dropped {{streaming}} video packets {{from the viewpoint}} of minimizing future dropped packets, as well as restoring data lost in packets already <b>dropped,</b> specifically <b>geared</b> toward real-time transmission of H. 263 + bitstream. Minimization of future dropped packets is achieved by an adaptive least mean squares bandwidth (BW) controller predicting the available bandwidth supported by the Internet with relatively little loss. Restoration of lost video data is performed by a combination of error concealment (EC) techniques, including interpolation of border pixels in DCT domain. All algorithms presented are computationally inexpensive and thus suited for real-time video applications. Index Terms — Available bandwidth, feedback channel, least-mean-squares algorithm, real-time rate control, video streaming...|$|R
50|$|Work still {{remained}} to be done, however, for soon after winding up {{the rescue of}} Homing Birds crew, Bering Strait received orders to rendezvous with the high-speed minelayer , {{to pick up the}} crew of a Superfortress that had ditched around 22:30 hours on 10 February 1945. The violent landing had claimed the lives of four of the B-29s crew. A patrolling “Dumbo” spotted the men the next morning, <b>dropped</b> survival <b>gear,</b> and covered them until Robert H. Smith picked them up that afternoon. On the morning of 12 February 1945, Bering Strait embarked the seven survivors of the third B-29. Returning to Saipan on 15 February, the ship disembarked the airmen the same day.|$|R
50|$|As the B-17 limps {{closer to}} base, Dearborn orders the landing <b>gear</b> <b>dropped.</b> Only one wheel descends due to {{electrical}} failure caused by battle damage, but the crew {{are able to}} manually lower the malfunctioning wheel just before landing. The ground crew and a humbled Lt. Colonel Derringer race to greet them with jubilant cheers. The crew exits the battered bomber and celebrate their victory with Daly on an ambulance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of landing gear semi-active control for a small trainer aircraft in a multibody framework. The behavior of single passive landing <b>gear</b> <b>drop</b> test simulation models and of a complete aircraft landing simulation model, developed and implemented in the commercial multibody code ADAMS in previous works, is compared to the that of analogous models equipped with semi-active shock absorber controllers. The control strategy and the controller tuning and sensitivity tests are briefly outlined {{and the results of}} its application to the landing gears is presented. The reduction in peak vertical attachment load values for the landing <b>gear</b> <b>drop</b> tests ranges from 5 % to 35 %, depending on the test conditions, and in the complete aircraft landing simulation, it is in the order of 5 % to 20 %, once again depending on the particular landing configuration. Comparisons between the drop tests and complete landing simulations in corresponding conditions are made, and the significant sensitivity tests are repeated on the complete aircraft model. ...|$|R
50|$|Through its River Room event facility, St. Paul's {{provides}} {{a site for}} a wide range of community activities, including wedding receptions, concerts, school proms, training seminars, fund-raising galas, and meetings of local community and business organizations. Saint Paul's also hosts athletes competing in the Augusta Ironman Triathlon each September, providing a pasta dinner for competitors, a <b>gear</b> <b>drop</b> for the swim event, drinks and snacks for participants and volunteers, and a quiet space for spiritual preparation.|$|R
5000|$|On February 13, 2011 a SALSA Jetstream 31 {{arriving}} in Port-au-Prince from Cap Haitien experienced {{issues with the}} left-wing landing gear locking into landing position due to a hydraulics system failure. After 30 minutes of attempting to <b>drop</b> the landing <b>gear,</b> the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing with {{only two of the}} three wheels locked for landing. All 19 passengers and 2 crew members safely evacuated with minor injuries. The aircraft, HH-ANA, was significantly damaged.|$|R
50|$|After the car's 1926 launch, Mark 1 {{production}} {{actually started}} in 1927 at Percy's engine factory, due to some {{resistance in the}} main works to the new design. It was such a critically acclaimed success that after fewer than a thousand cars had been produced the works quickly shut down side-valve production and tooled up for the new Nine in early 1928. This switch to the main factory coincided with several modernisations of the Mark 1 - the cone clutch was <b>dropped,</b> the <b>gear</b> lever and handbrake were moved from the right to {{the centre of the}} car and a Riley steering box was adopted, thus making the car the Mark II. The Mark III was a gentle update of the II at the end of 1928, evolving stronger wheels and a different arrangement of rods to the rear brakes.|$|R
50|$|Luyendyk guided his {{teammate}} Goodyear (second place), {{and the rest}} of the field around at a slow pace. As the cars came out of turn four, they anticipated seeing the white flag (indicating one lap to go), and it was clear to them the race would finish under caution, as did IMS Radio Network announcer Bob Jenkins. Without any warning, USAC officials suddenly displayed the white and green flag at the starter's stand, and the race was back underway. A startled Luyendyk, running about 85 mph, hastily <b>dropped</b> a <b>gear,</b> and punched the throttle to accelerate. The entire field was caught off-guard, and to make matters worse, the yellow caution lights around the track remained illuminated. The confusion made some drivers unsure if the green flag was in error, and if the conditions were safe to race.|$|R
5000|$|Engine RPM {{seemed to}} be more a {{function}} of accelerator pedal position than of actual road speed. [...] "Flooring" [...] the accelerator pedal would cause the engine speed to flare (even though there is no automatic downshift and no torque converter lockup to disengage). As the car would accelerate, RPM would further climb, but by a disproportionately smaller amount. Even more strangely, manually downshifting (see above) with the gas pedal already [...] "floored" [...] would not increase RPM in proportion to the 1.8:1 <b>drop</b> in <b>gear</b> ratio. The Dynaflow aural experience was similar to that of a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) (though modern electronically controlled CVT's address this throttle position dependent engine speed (and sound) characteristic by artificially inserting stepwise ratio changes instead of a truly continuous or constant rate change in order to simulate more driver-satisfying genuine shifts).|$|R
5000|$|In October 1991, an HH-60 and {{a tanker}} flew to an {{endangered}} sailboat about 250 {{miles south of}} its base. The Pave Hawk and HC-130 <b>dropped</b> survival <b>gear</b> to the vessel, which was riding out the storm, and began their return to base. Both aircraft encountered severe weather conditions and the helicopter was unable to take on fuel. The HH-60 was forced to ditch in the Atlantic Ocean about 60 {{miles south of the}} base in what would later become known as [...] "the Perfect Storm", and all but one member of the crew were saved by the crew of the United States Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa. TSGT Alden Smith, a pararescueman (PJ), lost his life fulfilling the squadron's motto That Others May Live. The mission was recounted in both a best selling book and major motion picture.|$|R
2500|$|Enterprise also lacked RCS {{thrusters}} (which were {{useless in}} atmospheric flight) and hydraulic mechanisms for {{the landing gear}}; the landing gear doors were simply opened {{through the use of}} explosive bolts and the <b>gear</b> <b>dropped</b> down solely by gravity. [...] As it was only used for atmospheric testing, Enterprise featured a large nose probe mounted on its nose cap, common on test aircraft because the location provides the most accurate readings for the test instruments, being mounted {{out in front of the}} disturbed airflow.|$|R
40|$|A {{landing gear}} {{is a good}} example of a highly {{nonlinear}} multidisciplinary system. Using hybrid modelling, nonlinear behaviour can be abstracted to discontinuous behaviour. Bond graphs are an established and intuitive method for constructing mathematical models of multiphysics dynamic systems. The Hybrid Bond Graph is therefore used here to demonstrate the modelling of a landing <b>gear</b> <b>drop</b> test. A distinction is drawn between structural and parametric discontinuities, represented using controlled junctions and elements. Causally static and dynamic bond graphs are compared. A mixed Boolean mathematical model is obtained from the causally dynamic graph...|$|R
50|$|A further {{complication}} was {{the unpredictable}} behaviour of the Eastleigh type of steam reverser employed. If this reverser misbehaved under the fluctuating pressures {{present in the}} steam chest, the locomotive {{seemed to have a}} will of its own. For example, if the reverser <b>dropped</b> into full <b>gear,</b> the slackness in the motion would make the valves overrun their designed full travel. This would result in the locomotive taking off like an unleashed race horse, high coal consumption, throwing the fire out of the chimney and running the risk of a violent high-speed slipping.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stranding}} {{was soon}} noticed by aeroplanes of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), and {{reported to the}} Hindu Kush, the Allied submarines HQ and depot ship. It was considered imperative that the E15 be destroyed to prevent the Turks from salvaging her. Several attempts were made; first, the British submarine B6, with Brodies brother on board, tried to sink her by torpedo but missed. Later, during the night, the destroyers HMS Grampus and Scorpion (commanded by the future Admiral A.B. Cunningham of World War II British Mediterranean Fleet fame), attempted to find her, but failed. The following morning, British submarine B11 also failed to locate the beached E15 owing to dense fog. Then the battleships [...] and [...] were ordered in but, prevented by intense fire from the Turkish shore batteries from getting within 11,000 metres of the submarine, were obliged to withdraw. Meanwhile, seaplanes attempted to bomb the stricken E15 but also failed.Finally, {{on the night of}} 18 April, two 17 metre picket boats, one from Triumph, the other from Majestic, both armed with two 14-inch (356 mm) diameter torpedoes mounted in <b>dropping</b> <b>gear,</b> went in. Lieutenant Commander Eric Robinson commanded the expedition from Triumphs boat; Lieutenant Claud Herbert Godwin skippered the boat from Majestic. Departing at 2200 hrs, the two vessels managed to navigate the narrow channel for seven miles before being detected and illuminated by searchlights, attracting a hail of fire from both shores. Miraculously both boats remained unscathed, and when one carelessly directed searchlight briefly illuminated the stricken submarine, Godwin seized his chance. Blinded by the lights, his first shot missed, and seconds afterwards the Turkish gunners scored their only hit, blowing away part of the stern and mortally wounding one seaman. Undeterred, Godwin went in again and fired his second torpedo, which struck E15 just forward of the conning tower, but well below the waterline. Robinson, observing his comrades plight, unhesitatingly brought his boat alongside and rescued them. Now doubly laden, Triumphs boat fled downstream unobserved, the Turkish gunners concentrating their fire on the drifting and abandoned wreck of her sister ship.|$|R
5000|$|At seven o'clock, Dundee {{gave the}} order to advance, {{at which point the}} Highlanders <b>dropped</b> their <b>gear,</b> fired what muskets they had and charged. Mackay's forces, {{realising}} the battle was on, stepped up their rate of fire; however, due to a shallow terrace on the hillside shielding the advancing Jacobites, this fire was partly masked. Eventually the lines met, and Mackay's men in the centre were [...] "swept away by the furious onset of the Camerons". Killiecrankie is the first recorded use of the plug bayonet by British troops in battle; it increased firepower by converting every man into a musketeer and eliminating the need for pikemen but required training and confidence in its use. Since the bayonet fitted into the barrel of the musket and prevented further reloading or firing, fixing them was delayed until the last possible moment; inexperience in this relatively new weapon and the speed of the Jacobite charge meant Mackay's force were effectively defenseless once the Highlanders came to close quarters and their retreat quickly turned into a rout in which 2,000 were killed.|$|R
50|$|In one of {{the opening}} exchanges, Crusaders wing Rico <b>Gear</b> <b>dropped</b> the ball from a high kick, the {{resulting}} play lead to a Hurricanes penalty. David Holwell missed the penalty attempt, it being taken from 30m out and near the touchline. The Hurricanes scored first through a long range Piri Weepu penalty goal in the 12th minute. Daniel Carter {{had an opportunity to}} level the scores with a penalty kick, but missed as well. Carter did make two penalties, leaving the half time score 6-3 in favour of the home side. Weepu went down several times {{in the first half and}} was momentarily knocked out.|$|R
