5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's <b>final</b> <b>design.</b> One World Trade Center's <b>final</b> <b>design</b> consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{designs for the}} energy being were {{considered}} for this episode; however, the final version was decided upon due to a desire to keep the design simple.

5|$|The {{design of}} Fort Tigné was mainly {{based on the}} Lunette d'Arçon, {{as well as the}} work of Marc René, marquis de Montalembert. The <b>final</b> <b>design</b> by Antoine Étienne de Tousard {{resulted}} in a revolutionary fortification, which made it one of the oldest polygonal forts in the world.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the <b>final</b> <b>design</b> {{was agreed}} in 1723, and it {{incorporated}} {{the work of}} de Tigné as well as Charles François de Mondion, the Order's military engineer. The new fort was to be square in shape, with four bastions and two cavaliers. The fort was financed by, and named after, the Portuguese Grand Master, António Manoel de Vilhena. He also set up the Manoel Foundation, a fund responsible for the maintenance and garrison of Fort Manoel and its outworks.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{the council}} held a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20. The <b>final</b> <b>design</b> had to include two full sized tennis courts, a bowling green, a cycling track, cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators. Although not fully complete, York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921. A cycling track surrounding the perimeter fence was in use by September of the same year.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, Sony gave fans {{a chance}} to design the film's poster with a prize of an {{undisclosed}} amount of cash, a free screening of the film, and with the <b>final</b> <b>design</b> being the film's poster. On February 16, 2002, Nick Des Barres, a 23-year-old aspiring actor and ex-video game magazine designer, was announced as {{the winner of the}} competition.

5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of the ruined church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios {{with a plan}} to build a fire and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. Palacios completed a design that fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His <b>final</b> <b>design</b> was said to have been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain.|$|E

The images and themes chosen represent Canadian accomplishments in science, technology, and exploration. The themes for the <b>final</b> <b>designs</b> were announced {{to the public at}} a media event on 20 June 2011 by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Jim Flaherty, the Minister of Finance, and William J. S. Elliott, commissioner of the RCMP.|$|R
5|$|Jet Kiss was {{commissioned}} by Sound Transit {{as part of their}} public art program in 2008, during planning and <b>final</b> <b>design</b> of the station. The initial concept was met with a mixed reception from the public over its use of warplanes, resulting in design modifications. It was installed in early 2015, and the station was opened to the public on March 19, 2016.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 2008, the FTA {{reversed}} the earlier decision and approved the above-ground project, {{saying that it}} met standards for cost efficiency, construction and ridership, moving it closer to receiving the $900 million in federal funding. Officials told The Washington Post that the project would move into the <b>final</b> <b>design</b> stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The <b>final</b> <b>design</b> therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E

5|$|The NJDOT is {{rebuilding}} the interchange at U.S. Route 46 and Valley Road in Clifton. This project will reconfigure ramps, bring bridges up to standard, and will provide for three-lane connections between Route 3 and U.S. Route 46. It {{is projected to}} cost more than $150million.

5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but <b>final</b> <b>design</b> and testing was farmed out to commercial firms {{with the understanding that}} production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop the smallest of the German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The first concept sketch {{portrayed the}} {{character}} as {{wearing a red}} hat with a green base and a white business shirt with a tie. SpongeBob's look gradually progressed to brown pants {{that was used in}} the <b>final</b> <b>design.</b> SpongeBob was designed to be a child-like character who was goofy and optimistic in a style similar to that made famous by Jerry Lewis.|$|E
30|$|Aiming at {{eliciting}} {{the different}} interface representations (pillar 3), a participatory practice was conducted. From the <b>final</b> <b>designs,</b> several norms {{that represent the}} system tailorable behavior were defined, implemented and tested with final users, {{as described in the}} next sub-sections.|$|R
50|$|The Totnes Pound was re-launched in June 2014 in {{denominations}} of t£1, t£5, t£10 and t£21. The <b>final</b> <b>designs</b> {{feature the}} author Mary Wesley, 'father of the computer' Charles Babbage, musician Ben Howard {{and the social}} activist and philanthropist Dorothy Elmhirst.|$|R
50|$|Brunel's patent {{specification}} shows wooden framed machines, which, while they show {{many of the}} principles of the machines actually installed bear little resemblance to the <b>final</b> <b>designs.</b> The machines submitted by Brunel to the Admiralty for evaluation are now in the National Maritime Museum. Once the contract with the Admiralty had been placed Bentham engaged Henry Maudslay to make them, and it is clear the <b>final</b> <b>designs</b> had considerable input from Bentham, Maudslay, Simon Goodrich, (mechanician to the Navy board) as well as Brunel himself. Due to Bentham's absence in Russia, it was Goodrich who actually brought the block mills into full production. Brunel's payment was based on the saving the Navy made with the new system.|$|R
5|$|The flight-deck cruiser was a {{proposed}} {{type of aircraft}} cruiser, warships combining features of aircraft carriers and light cruisers designed by the United States Navy during the period between World War I and World War II. Several designs were proposed for the type, but none were approved for construction. The <b>final</b> <b>design</b> was developed just before World War II, and the entry of the United States into the war saw the project come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the engraver sketched out a peer's helmet on the <b>final</b> <b>design,</b> which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer's helmet as a compliment to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|The large {{triangular}} plaza on {{the west}} side of One World Trade Center, facing the Hudson River, was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street. However, the steps were changed to a terrace in the <b>final</b> <b>design.</b> The terrace can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street. The terrace is paved in granite, and has 12 sweetgum trees, in addition to a block-long planter/bench.|$|E
