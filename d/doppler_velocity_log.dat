Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and <b>Doppler</b> <b>Velocity</b> <b>Logs</b> (DVL) have complementary characteristics and are promising sensors that could enable fully autonomous underwater navigation in unexplored areas without relying on additional external Global Positioning System (GPS) or acoustic beacons.

40|$|A {{correlation}} <b>velocity</b> <b>log</b> (CVL) is an ultrasonic navigation aid {{for marine}} applications, in which velocity is estimated using an acoustic transmitter and a receiver array. CVLs offer advantages over <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>logs</b> (DVLs) in many {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) applications, since they can achieve high accuracy at low velocities even during hover manoeuvres. DVLs require narrow beam widths, whilst ideal CVL transmitters have wide beam widths. This gives CVLs the potential to use lower frequencies thus permitting operation in deeper water, reducing power requirements for the same depth, or allowing the use of smaller transducers. Moving patterns in the wavefronts across a 2 D receiver array are detected by calculating correlation coefficients between bottom reflections from consecutive transmitted pulses, across all combinations of receiver pairings. The position of the peak correlation value, on a surface representing receiver-pairing separations, {{is proportional to the}} vessel's displacement between pulses. A CVL aimed primarily for AUVs has been developed. Its acoustical and signal processing design has been optimised through sea trials and computer modelling of the sound field. This computer model is also used to predict how the distribution of the correlation coefficients varies with distance from the peak position. Current work seeks to increase the resolution of the peak estimate using surface fitting methods. Numerical simulations suggest that peak estimation methods significantly improve system precision when compared with simply identifying the position of the maximum correlation coefficient in the dataset. The peak position may be estimated by fitting a quadratic model to the measured data using least squares or maximum likelihood estimation. Alternatively, radial basis functions and Gaussian processes successfully predict the peak position despite variation between individual correlation datasets. This paper summarises the CVL's main acoustical features and signal processing techniques and includes results of sea trials using the device. <br/...|$|R

50|$|Radio waves cannot {{penetrate}} water very far, so {{as soon as}} an AUV dives {{it loses}} its GPS signal. Therefore, a standard way for AUVs to navigate underwater is through dead reckoning. Navigation can however be improved by using an underwater acoustic positioning system. When operating within a net of sea floor deployed baseline transponders this is known as LBL navigation. When a surface reference such as a support ship is available, ultra-short baseline (USBL) or short-baseline (SBL) positioning is used to calculate where the sub-sea vehicle is relative to the known (GPS) position of the surface craft by means of acoustic range and bearing measurements. To improve estimation of its position, and reduce errors in dead reckoning (which grow over time), the AUV can also surface and take its own GPS fix. Between position fixes and for precise maneuvering, an Inertial Navigation System on board the AUV calculates through dead reckoning the AUV position, acceleration, and velocity. Estimates can be made using data from a Inertial Measurement Unit, and can be improved by adding a <b>Doppler</b> <b>Velocity</b> <b>Log</b> (DVL), which measures the rate of travel over the sea/lake floor. Typically, a pressure sensor measures the vertical position (vehicle depth), although depth and altitude can also be obtained from DVL measurements.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Survey-class Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) rely on <b>Doppler</b> <b>Velocity</b> <b>Logs</b> (DVL) for precise {{localisation}} {{and navigation}} near the seafloor. In {{cases where the}} seafloor depth {{is greater than the}} DVL bottom-lock range, localising between the surface, where GPS is available, and the seafloor presents a localisation problem since both GPS and DVL are unavailable in the mid-water column. Reliance on acoustic tracking methods such as Ultra Short Base Line (USBL) requires a ship to track the vehicle, while Long Base Line (LBL) requires the setting up of an acoustic transponder network. These methods provide bounded error position localisation (10 m) of the underwater vehicle, but inhibits the flexibility and autonomy of the vehicle due to tending or set-up requirements. Proposed alternatives to these include combining GPS on the surface, navigation-grade IMU, the DVL water-track mode and a vehicle model to reduce the dead-reckoning error, although results show that this error is still not competitive with acoustic tracking methods after approximately 10 minutes of descent. Often ocean depth requires hours of descent without GPS or DVL, thus acoustic tracking methods are preferred. This work proposes a solution to localisation in the mid-water column that exploits the fact that current profile layers of water columns are stable over short periods of time (in the scale of minutes). As demonstrated in simulation, using observations of these currents with the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) mode of the DVL during descent, along with sensor fusion of other low cost sensors, position error growth can be constrained to near the initial velocity uncertainty of the vehicle at the sea surface during a vertical dive. Following DVL bottom-lock, the entire velocity history is constrained to an error similar to the DVL velocity uncertainty. When coupled with a tactical-grade IMU and Time Differenced Carrier Phase (TDCP) GPS measurements, approximately 15 m/hr (2 sigma) position error growth is possible prior to DVL bottom-lock, and 6. 5 m/hr (2 sigma) position error growth is possible following DVL bottom-lock. The method is demonstrated using real data from the Sirius AUV coupled with on-bottom view-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping), without the use of an IMU. Horizontal localisation in the mid-water zone is also explored using an extension to the water-layer framework. The layered water currents are extended to include horizontal gridding, while the ADCP sensor is remodelled to use beam coordinates to exploit horizontal observation. The water current vector field is modelled as correlated spatially through neighbourhood least-squared constraints. Simulations illustrate the performance possible with this method, and results from real data validate this approach. In order to minimize the dead-reckoning error during mid-water zone transits, a novel method to incorporate Inertial Measurements and the constraints of a drag-based vehicle model is outlined. The drag-based Vehicle model uses the water current velocity estimates from the ADCP aiding method, while also accounting for the error from the Vehicle parameters given a prior system identification. Due to the redundant observations of motion from the IMU and DVL when available, there is potential for further improvement in estimates of the Vehicle parameters. Simulations are undertaken to assess the advantage of incorporating a vehicle model, and application on real data from the Sirius AUV validates this method...|$|R

The development of Maya was jointly funded by NIO and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, New Delhi, India (known as the Department of Information Technology prior to 2012). The AUV whose development began in 2003, completed horizontal plane tests in May 2005, with the first set of dive missions tested on May 12, 2006, making it India's first indigenously developed AUV for scientific applications. The vehicle has an endurance of 7.2 hours, a total length of approximately 1.7 m, a diameter of 0.234 m with a slender-ellipsoid shaped nose that is free-flooding and houses various scientific payloads. The nose-cone is designed to be swappable to use alternate scientific sensors depending upon the application. The main pressurized hull of the AUV is rated to 200m depth operations and houses the electronics, navigation sensors, batteries as well as the actuators for the rudders and fins. The AUV is propelled by a single rear thruster located in the aft section which also houses a mast for the GPS and communication antennae. Navigation sensors include a <b>Doppler</b> <b>Velocity</b> <b>Log</b> and a MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit. The vehicle weighs approximately 54 kg in air, with the main hull built from an Aluminum alloy. It is powered by Lithium polymer batteries and has a nominal speed of 1.5 m/s.

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{investigation of}} the relationship between VHF radar auroral backscatter intensity and <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> has been undertaken with data collected from 8 years operation of the Wick site of the Sweden And Britain Radar-auroral Experiment (SABRE). The results indicate three different regimes within the statistical data set; firstly, for <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> &lt; 200 m sâ€“ 1 , the backscatter intensity (measured in decibels) remains relatively constant. Secondly, a linear relationship is observed between the backscatter intensity (in decibels) and <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> for velocities between 200 m sâ€“ 1 and 700 m sâ€“ 1 . At velocities greater than 700 m sâ€“ 1 the backscatter intensity saturates at a maximum value as the <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> increases. There are three possible geophysical mechanisms for the saturation in the backscatter intensity at high phase speeds: a saturation in the irregularity turbulence level, a maximisation of the scattering volume, and a modification of the local ambient electron density. There is also a difference in the dependence of the backscatter intensity on <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> for the flow towards and away from the radar. The results for flow towards the radar exhibit a consistent relationship between backscatter intensity and measured velocities throughout the solar cycle. For flow away from the radar, however, the relationship between backscatter intensity and <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> varies during the solar cycle. The geometry of the SABRE system ensures that flow towards the radar is predominantly associated with the eastward electrojet, and flow away is associated with the westward electrojet.
