As the United States became more populous and prosperous, designs for post office buildings were developed. Providence's first federal building and custom house, built in the Italianate style, was constructed 1855-1857. As the city grew, the need for more space became apparent. In 1908, a new courthouse, post office, and custom house building in the Beaux Arts style was erected at the northeast <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Exchange</b> Place Mall (now Kennedy Plaza).

An exchange is deemed to be fair if at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> either each party receives the expected item or neither party receives any useful information about the other's item. Several protocols for fair exchange have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we rst examine a newly published fair exchange protocol and point out its aws and weaknesses. We then put forward a more e cient and secure protocol and give an informal analysis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. All {{neonates}} {{should be}} screened for congenital hypothyroidism {{in the first}} week of their lives. To evaluate the reliability of thyroid function tests in neonates who undergone exchange transfusion (ET), we studied the alteration of thyroid hormones after ET in neonates. &# 13; Methods. Eighteen full term neonates (gestation age> 37 weeks) undergoing ET due to heperbilirubinemia at neonatal wards of AI-Zahra and Shahid-Beheshti hospitals (affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences) were studied. All ETs were performed using a double volume exchange of adult donor blood. The age of subjects was five days or more. The patients had not Rh disease and seemed well. Thyroid function was evaluated before the exchange (pre-ET), at the conclusion of the ET (post-ET) and seven days later (by assessment of T 3, T 4, TSH). &# 13; Results. The mean pre-ET, T 4 and TSH concentrations were significantly higher than in donor blood. The mean pre-ET, T 3 concentration was not statistically different from donor blood. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> (post-ET), the mean T 4 and TSH concentrations dropped and statistically differed from pre-ET values, whereas the mean post-ET, T 4 and TSH were still significantly higher than the donor blood. The post-ET value was not significantly different from pre-ET, T 3 and T 3 of donor blood. After 7 days, T 4 and TSH concentrations increased and statistically reached to pre-ET, T 4 and TSH but at this time the mean T 3 concentration was significantly higher than pre-ET value. &# 13; Discussion. There was significant decrease in concentrations of T 4 and TSH at the end of ET but no difference at seven days later. Therefore, we suggest that the screening of congenital hypothyroidism should be performed either before the ET or after one-week Post Exchange transfusion...|$|E
40|$|The `mobility turn? in {{sociology}} challenges our easy equation of `society? with a given territorial area. The chapter begins {{by examining the}} arguments involved, pointing out how much sociological theorising about `fluidity? (e. g. Bauman) shares common assumptions with the extreme free market globalisation writers (e. g. Freeman). Using arguments from the sociology of technology, {{it is argued that}} we need to examine how new mobilities are created and also constrained, the uses that actors make of them and the consequences of such usage. This approach allows us to link the study of migration with the study of other forms of mobility, to examine the origins of mobility within social structure and the impact of mobility on social structure. The chapter then briefly reviews the extent to which conventional indicators show an expansion of mobility within and to/from Ireland: personal car ownership, air travel, migration. Against this background it discusses four different examples of mobility. A) Constrained mobility - car dependency in Dublin Rising car ownership in the Dublin area is linked to new constraints on mobility, from lengthening journey times for car users to the increasing marginalisation of those without cars. Our comparisons with some other cities shows that while this is hardly unique to Dublin, it is linked to the particular political governance of the city. B) Mobile careers ? software immigrants in Ireland The Celtic Tiger boom has depended on the immigration of large numbers of software workers, facilitated by ubiquitous air travel, internet-based job advertising and a global occupational mobility. However, such mobility has been generated by the very specific nature of the Irish software industry, in particular the reluctance of Irish firms to develop training. It does not occur in a boundaryless space, since it is shaped by national state regulation of migration. Equally, while individuals have used opportunities to travel to Ireland, our interviews show how their decisions are constrained by life cycle and family context, {{as well as by the}} labour market and training opportunities.. 3. Mobile lives ? travelling software workers Our study of business travel within the Irish software industry shows how high levels of business travel (which shades into migration) are also generated by particular features of the industry: its orientation to the US market and the way in which the very importance of a software `cluster? in Dublin also makes important `pipes? which connect the cluster to other clusters. Paradoxically the high usage of various forms of electronic communication within the industry also makes business travel even more important in order to maintain the `co-presence? on which effective ICT use depends. 4. Mobile assets ? Irish second homes abroad Flights from Central Europe are full of migrants coming to work in Ireland ? and Irish people (including people from the software industry) who have purchased property in these same countries. Such mobility is facilitated by the expansion of different forms of markets - cheap air travel as pioneered by Ryanair, the creation of markets for housing across Europe, the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> controls, easy electronic funds transfer. Such mobility impacts back on social structure: it creates new forms of inequality for some while loosening the link between occupation and life chances for others...|$|E

In recent years, distinguished scholars have emphasised {{the importance of}} this topic and, consequently, it has begun to attract more research interest. We welcome this development, and wish to take part in it by providing an analytical overview of the state of this research. The domain of the research review covers studies on switching relationships, on exiting a relationship, and on the dissolution or termination of a relationship. With regard to these studies, we will examine five major issues: the focus of research, its disciplinary background, key concepts, methodological approach, and key findings.
