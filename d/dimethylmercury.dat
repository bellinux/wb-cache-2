50|$|Organic {{mercury is}} formed when mercury {{combines}} with carbon and other elements. Examples of organic mercury compounds are <b>dimethylmercury,</b> phenylmercuric acetate, and methylmercuric chloride. The form most {{commonly found in}} the environment is methylmercury.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethylmercury</b> is {{extremely}} toxic and dangerous to handle. Absorption of doses {{as low as}} 0.1 mL can result in severe mercury poisoning. The risks are enhanced {{because of the high}} vapor pressure of the liquid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethylmercury</b> ((CH3)2Hg) is an organomercury compound. This colorless {{liquid is}} one of the strongest known neurotoxins. It is {{described}} as having a slightly sweet smell, although inhaling enough vapor to detect its odor would be hazardous.|$|E
50|$|Wetterhahn would {{recall that}} she had spilled one or two drops of <b>dimethylmercury</b> {{from the tip of}} a pipette onto her latex gloved hand. Not believing herself in any {{immediate}} danger, as she was taking all recommended precautions, she proceeded to clean up the area prior to removing her protective clothing. However, tests later revealed that <b>dimethylmercury</b> can, in fact, rapidly permeate different kinds of latex gloves and enter the skin within about 15 seconds. The exposure was later confirmed by hair testing, which showed a dramatic jump in mercury levels 17 days after the initial accident, peaking at 39 days, followed by a gradual decline.|$|E
50|$|Wetterhahn's death shocked {{not only}} the entire {{chemistry}} department at Dartmouth, but also regulatory agencies, as the accidental exposure occurred despite her having taken all required measures known at that time. These included the use of latex gloves, a fume hood, and adherence to standard safety procedures. After Wetterhahn's mercury poisoning was discovered, her colleagues tested various safety gloves against <b>dimethylmercury</b> {{and found that the}} small, apolar molecule diffuses through most of them in seconds, much more quickly than expected. As a result, it is now recommended to wear highly resistant, flexible, plastic-laminate gloves when handling <b>dimethylmercury</b> and other similarly dangerous substances. For increased protection, such thin gloves can be worn under long-cuffed, heavy-duty outer gloves made of, for example, neoprene.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of organomercury compounds presents both dangers and benefits. <b>Dimethylmercury</b> in particular, is notoriously toxic, but has found {{use as an}} antifungal agent and insecticide.

5000|$|<b>Di{{methylmercury}}</b> is metabolized {{after several}} days to methylmercury [...] Methylmercury crosses the blood-brain barrier easily probably owing to formation of a complex with cysteine.

50|$|Karen Wetterhahn (October 16, 1948 - June 8, 1997) was a {{professor}} of chemistry at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, who specialized in toxic metal exposure. She died of mercury poisoning {{at the age of}} 48 due to accidental exposure to the organic mercury compound <b>dimethylmercury</b> (Hg(CH3)2). Protective gloves in use {{at the time of the}} incident provided insufficient protection, and exposure to only a few drops of the chemical absorbed through the gloves proved to be fatal after less than a year.|$|E
50|$|Mercury can be inhaled and absorbed {{through the}} skin and mucous membranes, so {{containers}} of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, is always carried out with adequate ventilation {{in order to avoid}} exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds, such as <b>dimethylmercury</b> and methylmercury. However, inorganic compounds, such as cinnabar are also highly toxic by ingestion or inhalation of the dust. Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>dimethylmercury</b> was highlighted {{with the death}} of the inorganic chemist Karen Wetterhahn of Dartmouth College in 1997. After spilling {{no more than a few}} drops of this compound on her latex-glove, the barrier was immediately compromised and within seconds it was absorbed into the back of her hand, quickly circulating and resulting in her death ten months later. This accident is a common toxicology case-study and spurred the development of modern advanced chemical-protection clothing which is now used when any exposure to severely toxic and/or highly penetrative substances is possible (e.g., in chemical munitions stockpiles and decontamination facilities).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethylmercury</b> {{currently}} has few applications {{because of the}} risks involved. As with many methyl-organometallics, it is a methylating agent that can donate its methyl groups to an organic molecule; however, the development of less acutely toxic nucleophiles such as dimethylzinc and trimethylaluminium, and the subsequent introduction of Grignard reagents (organometallic halides), has essentially rendered this compound obsolete in organic chemistry. It was formerly studied for reactions in which the methylmercury cation was bonded to the target molecule, forming potent bactericides; however, the bioaccumulation and ultimate toxicity of methylmercury has largely led it to be abandoned for this purpose {{in favor of the}} less toxic diethylmercury and ethylmercury compounds, which perform a similar function without the bioaccumulation hazard.|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{three months}} after the initial {{accident}} Wetterhahn began suffering brief episodes of abdominal discomfort and noted a significant weight loss. The more distinctive neurological symptoms of mercury poisoning, including loss of balance and slurred speech, appeared in January 1997, five months after the accident. At this point tests proved that she was suffering from a debilitating mercury intoxication. She was admitted to the hospital, where it was discovered that the single exposure to <b>dimethylmercury</b> had raised her blood mercury level to 4,000 micrograms per liter, or 80 times the toxic threshold. Her urinary mercury content had risen to 234 Âµg per liter; its normal range is from 1 to 5 and the toxic level is > 50 Î¼g/L.|$|E
5000|$|Mercury and its {{compounds}} have {{a reputation}} for toxicity but on a scale of 1 to 10, <b>dimethylmercury</b> ((CH3)2Hg) (abbr. DMM), a volatile colourless liquid, {{has been described as a}} 15. It is so dangerous that scientists have been encouraged to use less toxic mercury compounds wherever possible. In 1997, Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry specialising in toxic metal exposure, died of mercury poisoning ten months after a few drops of DMM landed on her [...] "protective" [...] latex gloves. Although Wetterhahn had been following the then published procedures for handling this compound, it passed through her gloves and skin within seconds. It is now known that DMM is exceptionally permeable to (ordinary) gloves, skin and tissues. And its toxicity is such that less than one-tenth of a ml applied to the skin will be seriously toxic.|$|E
40|$|Whereas low {{concentrations}} of added <b>dimethylmercury</b> [0 < (DMM) â‰² 0. 1 - 1 mol dm- 3] increase the intersystem crossing rates of electronically excited aromatic molecules, higher {{concentrations of}} the fluorescence quencher favour electron transfer from the excited aromatic to the <b>dimethylmercury.</b> A kinetic scheme is proposed, based on fluorescence intensity measurements, on optical densities of triplet species and radical cations as observed by flash photolysis. The data {{are consistent with}} the formation of a trimolecular complex consisting of an electronically excited aromatic species and two molecules of <b>dimethylmercury.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
