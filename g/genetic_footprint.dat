Genetic analysis from a sample of tortoises from Volcan Wolf found 84 first-generation C. nigra hybrids, some less than 15 years old. The genetic diversity of these individuals is estimated to have required 38 C. nigra parents, many of which could still be alive on Isabela Island.|$|E
40|$|In vivo <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> was {{developed}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to simultaneously assess the importance of thousands of genes for the fitness of the cell under any growth condition. We have developed in vivo <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> for Escherichia coli, a model bacterium and pathogen. We further demonstrate the utility of this technology for rapidly discovering genes that affect the fitness of E. coli under a variety of growth conditions. The definitive features of this system include a conditionally regulated Tn 10 transposase with relaxed sequence specificity and a conditionally regulated replicon for the vector containing the transposase and mini-Tn 10 transposon with an outwardly oriented promoter. This system results in a high frequency of randomly distributed transposon insertions, eliminating the need for the selection of a population containing transposon insertions, stringent suppression of transposon mutagenesis, and few polar effects. Successful footprints have been achieved for most genes longer than 400 bp, including genes located in operons.

ABSTRACT Pairing {{high-throughput}} sequencing technologies with high-throughput mutagenesis enables genome-wide investiga-tions of pathogenic organisms. Knowledge {{of the specific}} functions of protein domains encoded by the genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major human pathogen that contributes to liver disease worldwide, remains limited to insight from small-scale studies. To enhance the capabilities of HCV researchers, we have obtained a high-resolution functional map of the entire viral genome by combining transposon-based insertional mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing. We generated a library of 8, 398 mutagenized HCV clones, each containing one 15 -nucleotide sequence inserted at a unique genomic position. We passaged this library in hepatic cells, recovered virus pools, and simultaneously assayed the abundance of mutant viruses in each pool by next-generation sequencing. To illustrate {{the validity of the}} functional profile, we compared the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints</b> of viral pro-teins with previously solved protein structures.

We have developed a rapid and efficient allelic exchange system by using the I-SceI homing endonuclease in conjunction with in vitro mariner mutagenesis to generate mutants within targeted regions of the P. aeruginosa chromosome for <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> analyses. This technique for generating transposon insertion mutants should be widely applicable to other organisms that are not naturally transformable or may lack well developed in vivo transposition systems. We tested this system with three genes in P. aeruginosa that have putative essential homologs in Haemophilus influenzae.

Most of these detection schemes build model of run-time {{behavior of}} a process {{on the basis of}} its data flow and/or sequence of system calls. These novel techniques have shown promising results but an efficient and effective technique must meet the following performance metrics: (1) high detection accuracy, (2) low false alarm rate, (3) small detection time, and (4) the technique should be resilient to run-time evasion attempts. To meet these challenges, a novel concept of <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> is proposed, by mining the information in the kernel Process Control Blocks (PCB) of a process, that can be used to detect malicious processes at run time. The <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> consists of selected parameters – maintained inside the PCB of a kernel for each running process – that define the semantics and {{behavior of a}}n executing process. A systematic forensic study of the execution traces of benign and malware processes is performed to identify discriminatory parameters of a PCB (task struct is PCB in case of Linux OS). As a result, 16 out of 118 task structure parameters are short listed using the time series analysis. A statistical analysis is done to corroborate the features of the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> and to select suitable machine learning classifiers to detect malware. The scheme has been evaluated on a dataset that consists of 105 benign Preprint submitted to Elsevier October 27, 2011 processes and 114 recently collected malware processes for Linux. The results of experiments show that the presented scheme achieves a detection accuracy of 96 % with 0 % false alarm rate in less than 100 milliseconds of the start of a malicious activity. Last but not least, the presented technique utilizes partial knowledge that is available at a given time while the process is still executing; as a result, the kernel of OS can devise mitigation strategies. It is also shown that the presented technique is robust to well known run-time evasion attempts...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) utilizes CD 4 {{as a primary}} receptor for viral entry and any of several 7 -transmembrane chemokine receptors, including CCR 5, as a co-receptor. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} multiple extracellular domains (ECDs) of CCR 5 contribute to co-receptor function; here we applied <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> to CCR 5 to confirm and extend those investigations. In <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting,</b> a duplex oligonucleotide is inserted into the DNA sequence of interest by use of either a bacterial transposase or retroviral integrase. Here, CCR 5 mutants were analyzed in bulk for their ability to be expressed on the recipient cell surface and to mediate viral entry of R 5 HIV isolates. Most of the approximately 150 CCR 5 mutants were not expressed on the cell surface. Of those remaining, 8 were specifically reduced or absent after macrophage (M) -tropic HIV infection, confirming a critical role of ECDs three (extracellular loop 2 or ECL 2) and possibly four (ECL 3) in viral entry. Mutational and functional analyses of ECD 4 (ECL 3) suggest it is under severe topological constraint for CCR 5 surface expression and are consistent with it contributing to co-receptor function...|$|R

Conventional mutational analysis has yielded considerable information about domains essential for these functions, yet many regions of gag remain uncharacterized. We used <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting,</b> a technique that permits the generation and simultaneous analysis {{of large numbers of}} mutations, to perform a near-saturation mutagenesis and functional analysis of 639 nucleotides in the gag region of Moloney murine leukemia virus. We report here the resulting functional map defined by eight footprints representing regions of Moloney murine leukemia virus gag, some previously uncharacterized, that are essential for replication. We found that significant portions of matrix and p 12 proteins were tolerant of insertions, in contrast to the N-terminal half of capsid, which was not. We analyzed 30 mutants from our library by using conventional methods to validate the footprints. Six of these mutants were characterized in detail, identifying the precise stage at which their replication is blocked.

These ancient genomes reveal predomestic population structure and a significant fraction of genetic variation shared with the domestic breeds but absent from Przewalski’s horses.

Job {{management}} subsystems {{in parallel}} environments {{have to address}} two important issues: (i) how to associate processes present in the system to the tasks of parallel jobs, and (ii) how to control execution of these tasks. The standard UNIX mechanism for job control, process groups, is not appropriate for this purpose as processes can escape their original groups and start new ones. We introduce the concept of genealogy, in which a process is identified by the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> it inherits from its parent. With this concept, tasks are defined by sets of processes with a common ancestor. Process tracking is the mechanism by which we implement the genealogy concept in the IBM AIX operating system. No changes to the kernel are necessary and individual process control is achieved through standard UNIX signaling methods. Performance evaluation, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems, demonstrate the efficacy of job control through process tracking. Process tracking has been incorporated in a research prototype gang-scheduling system for the IBM RS/ 6000 SP. ...|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} {{of a species}} is shaped by its recent evolutionary history {{and can be used}} to infer demographic events or selective sweeps. Most inference methods are based on the null hypothesis that natural selection is a weak or infrequent evolutionary force. However, many species, particularly pathogens, are under continuous pressure to adapt in response to changing environments. A statistical framework for inference from diversity data of such populations is currently lacking. Toward this goal, we explore the properties of genealogies in a model of continual adaptation in asexual populations. We show that lineages trace back to a small pool of highly fit ancestors, in which almost simultaneous coalescence of more than two lineages frequently occurs. While such multiple mergers are unlikely under the neutral coalescent, they create a unique <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> in adapting populations. The site frequency spectrum of derived neutral alleles, for example, is non-monotonic and has a peak at high frequencies, whereas Tajima's D becomes more and more negative with increasing sample size. Since multiple merger coalescents emerge in many models of rapid adaptation, we argue that they should be considered as a null-model for adapting populations. Comment: to appear in PNA...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{ranges of}} most species shift over time, for {{instance}} due to climate change, human intervention, or adaptation. These demographic changes often have drastic population genetic effects, {{such as a}} stochastic resampling of the gene pool through the “surfing” phenomenon. Most models assume that the speed of range expansions is only limited by the dispersal ability of the colonizing species and its reproductive potential. While such models of “phenotype-limited” expansions apply to species invasions, {{it is clear that}} many range expansions are limited rather by the slow motion of habitat boundaries, as driven for instance by global warming. Here, we develop a coalescent model to study the genetic impact of such “boundary-limited” range expansions. Our simulations and analysis show that the resulting loss of genetic diversity is markedly lower than in species invasions if large carrying capacities can be maintained up to the habitat frontier. Counterintuitively, we find that the total loss of diversity does not depend on the speed of the range expansion: Slower expansions have a smaller rate of loss, but also last longer. Boundary-limited range expansions exhibit a characteristic <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> and should therefore be distinguished from range expansions limited only by intrinsic characteristics of the species...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Normal and {{pathological}} scars are daily {{practice for}} the dermatologist and preventive as well as therapeutic management often lies within their hands. Dermal fibrosis is an inevitable event in adult scarring. A hypertrophic scar and keloid both result from an imbalance between the synthesis and breakdown of the extracellular matrix, favoring excessive fibrosis. To date no plausible hypothesis explaining the origin and differential behavior of a hypertrophic scar or keloid exists, but deregulated TGF-β transduced signals are considered to play a key role. A wide variety of different and combined scar management techniques have been advocated both for prevention and treatment of unaesthetic mature scars, hypertrophic scars and keloid. Preventive measures include a meticulous surgical technique and application of silicone gels or sheets. Surgical excision, dermabrasion and laser are established treatment modalities to improve non-pathological scars. Intralesional therapies with corticosteroids or antineoplastic agents are indicated to treat the excessive parts of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Cryosurgery and combination of excision with radiotherapy {{are considered to be}} more invasive methods and are therefore reserved for scars resistant to other therapies. Further research into the molecular mechanism and the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> of pathologic scars will optimize a tailored approach for every different scar type. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Novel drug {{targets are}} {{required}} {{in order to}} design new defenses against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Comparative genomics provides new opportunities for finding optimal targets among previously unexplored cellular functions, based on an understanding of related biological processes in bacterial pathogens and their hosts. We describe an integrated approach to identification and prioritization of broad-spectrum drug targets. Our strategy is based on <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> in Escherichia coli followed by metabolic context analysis of essential gene orthologs in various species. Genes required for viability of E. coli in rich medium were identified on a whole-genome scale using the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> technique. Potential target pathways were deduced from these data and compared with a panel of representative bacterial pathogens by using metabolic reconstructions from genomic data. Conserved and indispensable functions revealed by this analysis potentially represent broad-spectrum antibacterial targets. Further target prioritization involves comparison of the corresponding pathways and individual functions between pathogens and the human host. The most promising targets are validated by direct knockouts in model pathogens. The efficacy of this approach is illustrated using examples from metabolism of adenylate cofactors NAD(P), coenzyme A, and flavin adenine dinucleotide. Several drug targets within these pathways, including three distantly related adenylyltransferases (orthologs of the E. coli genes nadD, coaD, and ribF), are discussed in detail.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a cell culture system for producing infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) prompted genetic and functional studies of viral proteins and their roles in the assembly process. Since then, all ten viral proteins have been implicated in HCV assembly. Nonetheless, {{the exact location of}} the assembly site within an infected host cell remains unknown. Moreover, an understanding of the chronology of events and individual protein contributions at different stages of the assembly process has been difficult to obtain. The two studies comprising this dissertation apply high-resolution genetics and high-resolution imaging to the study of HCV in cell culture. Study 1 employs a high-resolution genetics approach to reveal a functional map of the entire HCV genome. Next-generation sequencing of an insertion mutant library following passage in cell culture revealed <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints</b> that reflected known biological functions of the underlying protein regions. We show how these <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints</b> can serve as a resource to identify flexible regions that tolerate insertion of tags useful for a variety of protein detection methods. Moreover, using the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints,</b> we identify a region in the NS 4 B protein that plays a role in post-RNA-replication steps. Study 2 examines HCV assembly through imaging, applying electron microscopy, electron tomography, superresolution light microscopy, multi-color fluorescence microscopy and live-cell imaging to the study of virus assembly. Our results indicate a juxtaposition of LDs, virus-like particles, membrane vesicles, clusters of HCV core protein and areas containing core-E 2 -NS 5 A proteins. The high-resolution snapshots underscore the functional compartmentalization of the LD environment, which provides viral proteins with membranous platforms to carry out a complex process such as virion assembly. We also show how our imaging platform can aid in the phenotypic characterization of an assembly-deficient mutant NS 5 A virus. The two studies presented in this dissertation further our understanding of the contributions of non-structural proteins such as NS 4 B and NS 5 A to the HCV assembly process. We suggest that the combination of the high-resolution genetic platform of study 1 and the high-resolution imaging platform of study 2 facilitates the identification and phenotypic characterization of viral protein regions involved in HCV assembly. A streamlined approach that integrates these two methods has the potential to identify additional targets for therapeutic intervention at post-genome-replication steps...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{millions}} {{single nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) have already been collected and deposited in public databases and these are important resources not only for use as markers to identify disease-associated genes, but also to understand the mechanisms that underlie the genome diversification. Results A spectrum analysis of SNP density distribution in the genomic regions around transcription start sites (TSSs) revealed a remarkable periodicity of 146 nucleotides. This periodicity was observed in the regions that were associated with CpG islands (CGIs), {{but not in the}} regions without CpG islands (nonCGIs). An analysis of the sequence divergence of the same genomic regions between humans and chimpanzees also revealed a similar periodical pattern in CGI. The occurrences of any mono- or di-nucleotide sequences in these regions did not reveal such a periodicity, thus indicating that an interpretation of this periodicity solely based on the sequence-dependent susceptibility to mutation is highly unlikely. Conclusion The periodical patterns of nucleotide variability suggest the location of nucleosomes that are phased at TSS, and can be viewed as the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> of the chromatin state that has been maintained throughout mammalian evolutionary history. The results suggest the possible involvement of the nucleosome structure in the promoter function, and also a fundamental functional/structural difference between the two promoter classes, i. e., those with and without CGIs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ferrando, A. et al. In {{the course}} of human migrations, {{domestic}} animals often have been translocated to islands {{with the aim of}} assuring food availability. These founder events are expected to leave a <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> that may be recognised nowadays. Herewith, we have examined the mitochondrial diversity of goat populations living in the Canarian and Balearic archipelagos. Median-joining network analysis produced very distinct network topologies for these two populations. Indeed, a majority of Canarian goats shared a single ancestral haplotype that segregated in all sampled islands, suggesting a single founder effect followed by a stepping-stone pattern of diffusion. This haplotype also was present in samples collected from archaeological assemblies at Gran Canaria and Lanzarote, making evident its widespread distribution in ancient times. In stark contrast, goats from Majorca and Ibiza did not share any mitochondrial haplotypes, indicating the occurrence of two independent founder events. Furthermore, in Majorcan goats, we detected the segregation of the mitochondrial G haplogroup that has only been identified in goats from Egypt, Iran and Turkey.

We investigated this issue by examining the population genetic features and evolutionary history of the natterjack toad (Bufo [Epidalea] calamita) in northern France, where populations {{can be found in}} native coastal habitats and coalfield habitats shaped by European industrial history, along with an additional set of European populations located outside this focal area. We predicted contrasting patterns of genetic structure, with newly settled coalfield populations departing from migration-drift equilibrium. As expected, coalfield populations showed a mosaic of genetically divergent populations with short-range patterns of gene flow, and native coastal populations indicated an equilibrium state with an isolation-by-distance pattern suggestive of postglacial range expansion. However, coalfield populations exhibited (i) high levels of genetic diversity, (ii) no evidence of local inbreeding or reduced effective population size and (iii) multiple maternal mitochondrial lineages, a <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> depicting independent colonization events. Furthermore, approximate Bayesian computations suggested several evolutionary trajectories from ancient isolation in glacial refugia during the Pleistocene, with biogeographical signatures of recent expansion probably confounded by human-mediated mixing of different lineages.

Gene essentiality conclusions {{were based on}} a semi-automatic analysis of the number and relative positions of inserts within each gene after selective outgrowth for 23 population doublings. Retention of multiple inserts generally identifies a gene as dispensable under these conditions. Failure to recover inserts, or the presence of {{only a limited number of}} inserts at the very ends of a coding sequence, suggests that the gene is essential under these growth conditions. Initial essentiality assertions were made automatically based on the number of transposon insertions detected within an ORF, and on the relative intensity of electrophoretic bands corresponding to each transposition event. The automatic calls were manually confirmed or corrected. Each ORF was categorized according to the criteria described below. ORFs were asserted as undetermined (X) if no reliable PCR data could be obtained for the corresponding region of the E. coli chromosome for technical reasons, such as PCR failure, nonspecific primer annealing in areas of DNA repeats, or insufficient length of generated PCR products. The later problem is often due to simultaneous synthesis of a large number of PCR products in a particular reaction.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} recognition that the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes shapes the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> of populations during and after range expansions. However, more complex ecological processes regularly considered within spatial ecology remain unexplored in models describing the population genetics of range expansion. In this study we integrate flexible descriptions of population growth and competition as well as conditional dispersal into a model that simulates the fate of mutations occurring at the wave front of an expanding population. Our {{results show that the}} survival and distribution of a mutation is not only affected by its bias (that is, whether it is deleterious, neutral or beneficial) but also by the mode of local density regulation and conditional dispersal of the simulated populations. It is in particular the chance of a mutation to establish at the front of advance and ‘surf' to high frequencies that critically depends on the investigated ecological processes. This is because of the influence of these processes on demographic stochasticity in the system and the differential responses of deleterious, neutral and beneficial mutations to this stochasticity. Generally, deleterious mutations rely more on chance and thus profit the most from ecological processes that enhance demographic stochasticity during the period of establishment. Our study emphasizes the importance of incorporating more ecological realism into evolutionary models to better understand the consequences of shifting geographic ranges for the genetic structure of populations and to find efficient adaptation strategies to mitigate these effects...|$|E

We sequenced 50 nuclear markers by next generation sequencing and one mitochondrial marker by Sanger sequencing for four populations from the native range of both parent species and eleven ponds on the Veluwe. We use three population genetic approaches (HIest, BAPS and Structure) to determine the genetic composition of the Veluwe newts based on all nuclear markers, a subset of 18 diagnostic markers and the complementary 32 non-diagnostic markers, with and without parental populations. BAPS underestimates genetic pollution, whereas Structure is comparatively accurate compared to HIest, although Structure’s relative advantage decreases with the diagnosticity of the markers. Data simulation confirms these findings. Genetic composition of the Veluwe ponds ranges from completely native, via different degrees of genetic admixture, to completely invasive. The observed hybrid zone appears to be bimodal, suggesting negative selection against hybrids. A <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> of the native species is present in invasive populations, evidencing that the invasive locally replaced the native species. Genetic pollution is currently confined to a small area, but the possibility of further expansion cannot be excluded. Removal of genetic pollution will not be easy. We emphasize the need for legal guidance to manage genetic pollution...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{weight that}} gene copy number plays in {{transcription}} remains controversial; although in specific cases gene expression correlates with copy number, the relationship cannot be inferred {{at the global}} level. We hypothesized that genes steadily expressed by 15 melanoma cell lines (CMs) and their parental tissues (TMs) should be critical for oncogenesis and their expression most frequently influenced by their respective copy number. Results: Functional interpretation of 3, 030 transcripts concordantly expressed (Pearson's correlation coefficient p-value < 0. 05) by CMs and TMs confirmed an enrichment of functions crucial to oncogenesis. Among them, 968 were expressed according to the transcriptional efficiency predicted by copy number analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient p-value < 0. 05). We named these genes, "genomic delegates" as they represent {{at the transcriptional level}} the <b>genetic</b> <b>footprint</b> of individual cancers. We then tested whether the genes could categorize 112 melanoma metastases. Two divergent phenotypes were observed: one with prevalent expression of cancer testis antigens, enhanced cyclin activity, WNT signaling, and a Th 17 immune phenotype (Class A). This phenotype expressed, therefore, transcripts previously associated to more aggressive cancer. The second class (B) prevalently expressed genes associated with melanoma signaling including MITF, melanoma differentiation antigens, and displayed a Th 1 immune phenotype associated with better prognosis and likelihood to respond to immunotherapy. An intermediate third class (C) was further identified. The three phenotypes were confirmed by unsupervised principal component analysis. Conclusions: This study suggests that clinically relevant phenotypes of melanoma can be retraced to stable oncogenic properties of cancer cells linked to their genetic back bone, and offers a roadmap for uncovering novel targets for tailored anti-cancer therapy...|$|E
50|$|An {{autosomal}} {{study in}} 2011 found an average Northwest African influence of about 17% in Canary Islanders {{with a wide}} interindividual variation ranging from 0% to 96%. According to the authors, the substantial Northwest African ancestry found for Canary Islanders supports that, despite the aggressive conquest by the Spanish in the 15th century and the subsequent immigration, <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints</b> of the first settlers of the Canary Islands persist in the current inhabitants. Parallelling mtDNA findings (50.1% of U6 and 10.83% of L haplogroups), the largest average Northwest African contribution (42.50%) was found for the samples from La Gomera. According to Flores et al. (2003), genetic drift could {{be responsible for the}} contrasting difference in Northwest African ancestry detected with maternal (51% of Northwest African lineages) and paternal markers (0.3-10% of Northwest African lineages) in La Gomera. Alternatively, it could reflect the dramatic way the island was conquered, producing the strongest sexual asymmetry in the archipelago.|$|R
40|$|Modern humans {{originated}} in Africa around 200, 000 {{years ago and}} today have settled in nearly every corner of earth. During migrations humans became exposed to new pathogens, food sources and have encountered vastly different environments. Natural selection likely contributed to the survival under such diverse conditions by promoting the raise in frequency of advantageous alleles. Thereby natural selection leaves <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints</b> that we can identify. The thesis at hand is about understanding how natural selection has shaped different human populations by analyzing these <b>genetic</b> <b>footprints.</b> In the first study, I infer the evolutionary history of an insertion-substitution variant using present-day human genomic data. This variant is interesting because the ancestral allele encodes a previously unannotated open-reading frame for a gene with antiviral ac- tivity (IFNL 4), while the derived allele truncates this open-reading frame and is strongly associated with improved clearance of Hepatitis C, a major health care problem. Using an approximate bayesian computation approach I infer a complex evolutionary history, where the derived, truncating allele evolved under weak positive selection in Africa, with selection strength increasing in non-African populations, especially in East Asian popu- lations where the truncating allele is nearly fixed today. Hence, the changes in selection and resulting population differences in allele frequency contribute to the variation in Hep- atitis C clearance observed across human populations today. In the second study, I use ancient human genomes to estimate genome-wide allele frequencies {{in the past to}} understand present-day population differentiation. I develop a new statistic and incorporate the genome of Ust’-Ishim, a modern human that lived 45, 000 year ago in Siberia, to study to what extent natural selection and drift have contributed to human population differentiation. The results suggest that European populations carry high frequency alleles in protein-coding (genic) regions that evolved under strong, recent positive selection. Further, the genic alleles that rose in frequency recently in Europeans were already present in ancient hunter-gatherers more often than in ancient farmers. This suggests that during the colonization of Europe local, positive selection changed the frequency of advantageous alleles in hunter-gatherer populations prior to the influx of farming individuals and those alleles remained beneficial also in the later admixed populations...|$|R
40|$|Defining {{the gene}} {{products}} that play {{an essential role}} in an organism’s functional repertoire is vital to understanding the system level organization of living cells. We used a <b>genetic</b> <b>footprinting</b> technique for a genome-wide assessment of genes required for robust aerobic growth of Escherichia coli in rich media. We identified 620 genes as essential and 3, 126 genes as dispensable for growth under these conditions. Functional context analysis of these data allows individual functional assignments to be refined. Evolutionary context analysis demonstrates a significant tendency of essential E. coli genes to be preserved throughout the bacterial kingdom. Projection of these data over metabolic subsystems reveals topologic modules with essential and evolutionarily preserved enzymes with reduced capacity for error tolerance. Sequencing and comparative analysis of multiple diverse genomes is revolutionizing contemporary biology by providing a framework for interpreting and predicting the physiologic properties of an organism. A variety of emerging postgenomic techniques such as genome-wide expression profiling and monitoring of macromolecular complex formation can reveal the detailed molecular compositions of cells.
