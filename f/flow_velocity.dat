5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous <b>flow</b> <b>velocity</b> is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the <b>flow</b> <b>velocity</b> at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The <b>flow</b> <b>velocity</b> will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the <b>flow</b> <b>velocity</b> vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Patients with β-thalassemia {{intermedia}} have {{a higher}} incidence of thromboembolic events compared to the general population. Previous studies have shown that patients with sickle cell disease, who are also prone to ischemic events, have higher intracranial arterial blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> measured by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate intracranial arterial <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in patients with β-thalassemia intermedia and compare the results with those found in healthy subjects. Methods. Sixty-four patients with β-thalassemia intermedia and 30 healthy subjects underwent transcranial Doppler sonography. Results. Significantly higher <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> were found in intracranial arteries of patients compared to controls (P = 0. 001). Previously splenectomized patients with thrombocytosis showed higher <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> than nonsplenectomized patients without thrombosis. Conclusion. The increased <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in patients with β-thalassemia intermedia may point to a higher risk of ischemic events.

40|$|Convential {{models for}} the erosion of {{non-cohesive}} sediments overestimate the erosion rate induced by high <b>flow</b> <b>velocities.</b> These high <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> occur, for instance, in breaching of embankments or dunes (<b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> up to 10 m/s) or in jetting sand with a {{trailing suction hopper dredger}} (30 to 60 m/s). At these very large <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> the erosion process is significantly influenced by the properties of the soil mass (non-cohesive particles). Governing parameters at higher <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> are dilatancy, permeability and the (un) drained shear strength of the soil. The sediment concentration in the water also influences the erosion process, especially in case of higher erosion rates. Based on the concept of Van Rhee (2007, 2010) a simple analytical formula is derived that gives a clear insight into the parameters influencing hindered erosion. The concept of hindered erosion is explained by two properties of granular soils: dilatancy and permeability. This implicates that the erosion behaviour of granular soils cannot be described by the behaviour of single particles alone. The properties of the whole soil mass should be considered in predicting erosion at higher <b>flow</b> <b>velocities.</b> Results of a large-scale breach experiment performed in 1994 in the Zwin Channel in the Netherlands (Visser, 1998) are analyzed to evaluate the formula.

40|$|Today, {{progress}} in resuscitation techniques allows patients to survive even longer lasting cerebral hypoxia. Therefore {{the assessment of}} the neurological prognosis of these patients is of considerable importance. In the present study we performed systematic investigations of changes of blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the arteries of Willis in successfully resuscitated patients six times in the first 72 hours after resuscitation. Afterwards, we interpreted our findings. Additionally, vital parameters as well as ventilation parameters were registrated. Once the neuron specific enolase (NSE) was analyzed as an indicator of hypoxic brain damage. 39 patients were investigated 1. 5 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h and 72 h after resuscitation with the help of TCD. In retrospect, they were devided into the group of „survivors” (n= 17) and the group of „dead patients”(n= 22). 22 („dead patients”) patients died within 9 ± 14 days (n= 21) or remained in a vegetative state (n= 1). 17 patients („survivors”) survived without moderate or severe neurological deficits. 4 hours after the cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) the systolic (80. 5 ± 12. 8 cm/sec) and the diastolic (30. 6 ± 7. 8 cm/sec) blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> of the MCA were higher in the survivors than in the dead patients (systolic 66. 8 ± 19. 3 cm/sec; diastolic 24. 0 ± 14. 1 cm/sec; p< 0. 05). This was also true for the blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> of the MCA 72 hours after CPR (p< 0. 05; survivors: systolic 101. 1 ± 31. 9 cm/sec, dead patients: 80. 1 ± 41. 2 cm/sec). 8 hours after CPR the resistance index RI (RI=(sys-dia) /sys) of the MCA and 24 hours after CPR the RI of the ACA and PCA were higher in the patients who died; e. g. RI of the MCA 8 hours after CPR: Survivors 0. 62 ± 0. 06, dead patients 0. 68 ± 0. 09. 24 hours after CPR there were significant differences in the systolic and diastolic blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the ACA in PCA in both groups: 24 hours after CPR the systolic (92. 1 ± 35. 6 cm/sec) and the diastolic (43. 1 ± 24. 2 cm/sec) blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the ACA of the survivors were significantly higher than the systolic (65. 3 ± 25. 1 cm/sec) and diastolic (23. 1 ± 11. 7 cm/sec) blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> of the patients who died. This was also true for the blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the PCA: 24 hours after CPR the systolic (52. 2 ± 8. 3 cm/sec) and the diastolic (22. 4 ± 5. 9 cm/sec) blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the PCA of the survivors are significantly higher than the systolic (45. 0 ± 7. 2 cm/sec) and diastolic (15. 4 ± 3. 9 cm/sec) blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> of the patients who died. In the first three days after CPR correlations of systolic blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the MCA with systolic arterial blood pressures revealed low values between + 0. 21 and - 0. 11 in the survivors early after CPR (4 to 16 hours) and high values of + 0. 52 to + 0. 81 in patients who died. This clearly pointed at the resumption of the cerebral autoregulation in the survivors; the high correlation values of those who died speak for a blood pressure passive cerebral circulation; the cerebral autoregulation of those who died was disturbed. Additionally, we calculated thresholds of systolic and diastolic blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in different arteries 4 hours, 24 hours and 72 hours after CPR to identify patients who would survive or who would die. 24 hours after CPR at the latest all patients who would die were identified. With the help of TCD blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the arteries of Willis can be investigated in patients after CPR. Blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> and their changes hint at a disturbed or undisturbed cerebral autoregulation.

40|$|Sixty-seven {{patients}} (45 {{males and}} 22 females) aged 2 to 70 years (mean 36 years) {{who had suffered}} closed head injury were investigated with daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) recordings. A total of 470 TCD recordings (mean 7) were made during Days 1 to 14 after admission. Blood <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> were determined in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA). Twenty-seven (40 %) of the 67 patients demonstrated traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH) on the first computerized tomography (CT) scan after the injury. <b>Flow</b> <b>velocities</b> exceeded 100 cm/second in 22 patients. Eleven (41 %) of the 27 patients who showed tSAH on the first CT scan developed velocities greater than 100 cm/second, as compared to 11 (28 %) of 40 patients without tSAH on CT. Two patients in whom {{a thick layer of}} tSAH was revealed on the first CT scan had MCA <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> exceeding 200 cm/second for several days. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) were performed in six tSAH patients who showed TCD <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> exceeding 120 cm/second (uni- or bilaterally) to determine whether the increase in velocity reflected vasospasm or hyperemia. The SPECT studies verified ischemia in five patients but revealed general hyperemia in one. The bilateral increase in MCA <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> in the latter case was due to high-volume flow through the MCA secondary to elevated CBF rather than arterial narrowing. In one patient with a thick layer of subarachnoid blood on a CT scan obtained at admission, MCA <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> exceeded 220 cm/second bilaterally on Day 8 after the head injury. A SPECT measurement obtained on the same day reflected bilateral ischemia. In this patient <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> decreased, with a corresponding normalization of CBF, after 5 days of intravenous nimodipine administration. The MCA/ICA ratio correlated well with the distribution of CBF in the six patients studied using SPECT.
