5|$|At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, {{while trying}} to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries {{to pull the plug}} on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies {{unconscious}} in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that {{he was the one who}} put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he <b>is</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Frankie risks {{putting her}} in the junior welterweight class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to {{establish}} a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a Gaelic nickname on her. The two travel Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but she berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> at her.|$|E

500|$|About Presley's performance, Down Beat wrote: [...] "Let it {{be noted}} that Elvis Presley's latest, King Creole, is his best picture thus far--comparatively speaking, of course. Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get an inkling of what acting's all about." [...] TV-Radio Mirror {{magazine}} praised Presley's acting over his past roles: [...] "Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was a laughing stock. [...] But nobody <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> now". Meanwhile, The Monthly Film Bulletin criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, [...] "This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie".|$|E

Theroux and a BBC film crew spent three weeks in Topeka, Kansas, gathering information on the 71 members of the organisation. In an article for The Guardian, Theroux noted, [...] "It was fascinating to see {{the power of a}} family to create its own bizarre ideology and pass it down through the generations." [...] In a statement in The Age, Theroux posited, [...] "Maybe, through my enthusiasm, people reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them." [...] The Western Mail quoted Theroux on how he selects subject matter which interests him, [...] "The subjects I'm interested in are quite extreme. They're so far beyond the pale of normal human interaction that you're never going to get a reality show on that territory." ...|$|E
500|$|Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian {{said that}} before Guetta's collaborations with Kelis ("Acapella") and Rowland, she felt [...] " [...] was ruining R by turning all of my {{favorite}} ladies into Euro cheesemongers". However [...] "Acapella" [...] changed Nicholson's mind and she said, [...] "'Commander' is further evidence of this". Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars, his review was neither positive nor negative. He said [...] "Singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing (and bossy) they are. Even if the words have a double meaning, which hints that they are merely mouthing the self-regard of a rampant egomaniac, who <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing, they don't mind. Why would they? The song mentions hair, and being {{better than the other}} ladies. That's what singers live for. [...] one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus, which rules." [...] Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song, instead saying it will put her [...] "firmly in control of the dance floor". Entertainment Weekly named it [...] "the number one summer jam of the year" [...] whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24, 2010. A reviewer from the network said, [...] "Commander is another smash ... Kelly's taking command! With glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power 'Commander' is proof that Kelly means business!"

[...] She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for [...] "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up." [...] Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do [...] "homework" [...] from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for [...] "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will [...] "renovate" [...] her life. [...] During the following day of [...] "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to [...] "renovate their homes" [...] together. [...] In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for [...] "knocking down her old house", and proceeds {{to tell her that}} now she can rebuild a new house.|$|E

Of course, the terrible [...] "revolution" [...] did not come off. Nobody {{with a grain of}} sense supposed that it would. Yet, in spite of universal laughter, the people are seriously disgusted with these official Red scares. They cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars spent in assembling soldiers and policemen and in paying wages and expenses to Mr. Palmer's agents. They help to frighten capital and demoralize business, and to make timid men and women jumpy and nervous.|$|E

'Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.'" [...] Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating {{that at the time of}} Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag.|$|E
