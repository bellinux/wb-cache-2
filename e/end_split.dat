Sixty-three trees from a commercial stand located in the north coast of Rio Grande do Sul state were selected.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of thinning in the end splits of the logs of the Eucalyptus grandis at 18 years of age. There was analyzed a thinning experiment, located in the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, installed in randomized blocks with four repetitions. The seven treatments were defined according {{to the number of}} thinnings applied and ranged from zero to six interventions. The trees were selected, in each treatment, {{on the basis of the}} Assmannâ€™s dominant diameter and the central diameter of tree, being referred to as dominant and central trees, respectively.

The results indicate that the average end splits of the logs in the dominant and central trees was higher at the second log sampled, suggesting that sectioning should be carried in conjunction with techniques that minimize the growth stress, especially when this is performed near the half of the commercial height.

40|$|Lumber drying is {{the most}} energy and time {{consuming}} process within the rubberwood lumber industry. The aim ofthis study was to develop an effective drying schedule for rubberwood lumber by accelerating the moisture movement out oflumber without degrading the lumber during drying. The study explored the effect of dry bulb temperature (60 oC, 75 oC and 90 oC), steaming {{at the beginning of}} drying, predrying of lumber prior to drying, and top loading of lumber on the dryingcharacteristics and lumber quality (bow, crook, twist, <b>end</b> <b>splitting</b> and color) of 30 mm thick rubberwood lumber under thetarget EMC at 4 % and air velocity of 4 m/s. Accelerated conventional temperature drying of lumber at 90 oC reduced thedrying time by ~ 50 % from 117 hours to 54 hours but increased the energy consumption by 22 % with respect to the conventionaltemperature drying at 60 oC. The average activation energy for drying was 26 kJ/mol. Drying temperature had verylittle effect on quality of lumber after drying (bow, crook, twist, <b>end</b> <b>splitting</b> and color).

40|$|The objetive of {{this study}} is to cluster {{selected}} trees of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex-Maiden as a function of phenotypic, dendrometric and wood technology characteristics. In a 27 years old commercial stand, located in the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul, 63 selected trees were cut down and classified to the phenotypic and dendrometric characteristics. Then, disks were taken at the base, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the commercial height, and at the DBH, for basic density determination. From the two first logs above the DBH boards parallel to the pith were taken, with 25 mm of thickness, for sawn wood qualitative evaluation. The selected trees were grouped into four distinct groups following cluster analysis. In Group I were classified the trees with a lower tendency of presenting boards with <b>end</b> <b>splits</b> while in Groups II and III were classified the trees with a lower tendency of presenting logs with <b>end</b> <b>splits</b> and, in Group IV were classified the trees with a higher tendency of presenting <b>end</b> <b>splits</b> of the boards and the logs.
