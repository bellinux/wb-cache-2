40|$|Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) {{have shown}} {{promising}} potential to stop intervertebral disc degeneration in several animal models. In order {{to restore a}} healthy state, though, this potential should be further stimulated. Notochordal cells (NCs), influential in disc development, {{have been shown to}} stimulate BMSC differentiation, but it is unclear how this effect will translate in an environment where resident disc cells (nucleus pulposus cells [NPCs]) could also influence BMSCs. The goal of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the effects of NCs on BMSCs when cocultured with NPCs, in a simplified 3 D in vitro system. Bovine BMSCs and NPCs were mixed (Mix) and seeded into alginate beads. Using culture inserts, the Mix was then cocultured with porcine NCs (alginate beads) and compared to coculture with empty beads or porcine skin fibroblasts (SFs, alginate beads). NPCs alone were also cocultured with NCs, and BMSCs alone cultured under chondrogenic conditions. The effects of coculture conditions on cell viability, matrix production (proteoglycan and collagen), and gene expression of disc markers (aggrecan, type II collagen, and SOX 9) were assessed after 4 weeks of culture. The NC phenotype and gene expression profile were also analyzed. Coculture with NCs did not significantly influence cell viability, proteoglycan production, or <b>disc</b> <b>marker</b> gene expression of the Mix. When compared to NPCs, the Mix produced the same amount of proteoglycan and displayed a higher expression of <b>disc</b> <b>marker,</b> indicating a stimulation of the BMSCs (and/or NPCs) in the Mix. Additionally, during the 4 weeks of culture, the NC phenotype changed drastically (morphology, gene expression profile). These results show that NCs might not be as stimulatory for BMSCs in an NPC-rich environment, as believed from individual cultures. This absence of effects could be explained by a mild stimulation provided by (de) differentiating NCs and the costimulation of BMSCs and NPCs by each other...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} to complement the declining population of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) found in a degenerative intervertebral disc. Although able to stop degeneration, they could not produce enough matrix to restore a healthy state. Looking at development, when {{a large amount of}} matrix is produced, the disc also contains notochordal cells (NCs), potential progenitors or regulators of NPCs. The aim of the study was, therefore, to combine NCs to a BMSC/NPC mix and evaluate their effects on cell phenotype and matrix production, in long-term culture. Methods: In a 3 D hydrogel, NCs were co-cultured in different ratios with BMSCs and/or NPCs. Matrix production, cell morphology, and gene expression of disc markers were assessed after 4 weeks of culture. Results: At day 28, BMSCs/NPCs highly expressed disc matrix markers (type II collagen and aggrecan) and produced disc matrix up to 30 % of values obtained for the positive control (BMSCs under TGFß stimulation). The addition of NCs only slightly up-regulated marker expression (6 - 12 x increase); an up-regulation not reflected at the matrix level. During the 4 weeks of culture, however, the NC phenotype changed drastically (morphology, <b>disc</b> <b>marker</b> expression). Conclusion: In contrast to previously reported short-term studies, long-term co-cultures with NCs had no substantial effects on BMSCs and NPCs, most likely due to the loss of the NC native phenotype during culture. It, therefore, appears critical to maintain this specific phenotype for a long-term effect of the NCs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) is a progressive and chronic process, {{and the high}} incidence of discogenic disorders calls for new therapeutic approaches, such as cell-based therapies using three dimensional cultures and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which can differentiate to chondrogenic- and IVD-lineages. Here, we investigated the growth and differentiation of human MSC culture on biodegradable collagen scaffolds in order to obtain an injectable suspension. Commercially available wound dressings were downsized to dimensions between 100 and 1500 μm and seeded with freshly isolated or early passages MSC. Proliferation rate and chondrogenic differentiation potential was tested at oxygenation levels of 2 %, 5 %, 10 % and 21 % in static and dynamic cultures. Evaluation methods included cell viability test, <b>disc</b> <b>marker</b> genes expression (aggrecan, collagen type I and type II), histological detection of proteoglycans and immunohistochemical analysis. On microcarriers, freshly isolated MSC had lower proliferation rate and chondrogenic differentiation potential compared with early passages MSC. Proliferation of MSC was significantly increased 1. 7 -fold at 5 % oxygen level and in combination with dynamic culture was further increased to 2. 3 -fold, with respect to normoxia. Chondrogenesis was positively affected by 2 % and 5 % hypoxia, as shown by increased transcription levels and protein expression of collagen type II and proteoglycan accumulation in static cultures, while it was inhibited in dynamic cultures. Collagen type I and aggrecan expression were not affected by hypoxia. In conclusion, collagen based microcarriers are a suitable support for in vitro MSC growth and chondrogenesis especially when cultured at 5 % oxygen level...|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} in developmental biology is how growth factor signals are integrated to generate pattern. In {{this study we}} investigated {{the integration of the}} Drosophila BMP and Wingless/GSK 3 signaling pathways via phosphorylations of the transcription factor Mad. Wingless was found to regulate the phosphorylation of Mad by GSK 3 in vivo. In epistatic experiments, the effects of Wingless on wing <b>disc</b> molecular <b>markers</b> (senseless, distalless and vestigial) were suppressed by depletion of Mad with RNAi. Wingless overexpression phenotypes, such as formation of ectopic wing margins, were induced by Mad GSK 3 phosphorylation-resistant mutant protein. Unexpectedly, we found that Mad phosphorylation by GSK 3 and MAPK occurred in segmental patterns. Mad depletion or overexpression produced Wingless-like embryonic segmentation phenotypes. In Xenopus embryos, segmental border formation was disrupted by Smad 8 depletion. The results show that Mad is required for Wingless signaling and for the integration of gradients of positional information. © 2009 Eivers et al...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{two methods}} based on machine vision to provide driver {{assistance}} in seed drill guidance {{in order to}} improve spacing accuracy during contiguous passages. The first case consisted of following the furrow created at the preceding passage by a special <b>marker</b> <b>disc</b> attached to the seed drill. A camera was located on the tractor and detected this furrow. In the second case, the seed rows themselves were detected by the camera without making use of the <b>marker</b> <b>disc.</b> In both cases, several video sequences were acquired in various situations, including different soil textures and various illumination conditions (375 sequences were acquired during three years). A pre-treatment of these sequences was performed and included a background subtraction in order to remove shadows and other wide unevenness. In the first case, the best results were obtained by using an image treatment based on the Hough transform coupled to a recursive filter. The search of the maximum of the Hough transform was performed using a mean shift algorithm. In the second case, where several parallel rows were simultaneously present on the images, an adapted Hough transform was proposed which took into account the a priori knowledge of the rows spacing. The trueness and precision in row detection were superior in the second case. The results are compatible with the application, since the trueness was smaller than 30 mm. This suggested that it can be possible to assist the manual guidance of a seed drill by an automatic system consisting in a camera detecting the seed rows. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveaaEven {{though the}} role of the DICS 1 gene as a risk factor for {{schizophrenia}} is still unclear, there is substantial evidence from functional and cell biology studies that supports the connection of the gene with schizophrenia. The studies associating the DISC 1 gene with schizophrenia in Asian populations are limited to East-Asian populations. Our study examined several <b>DISC</b> 1 <b>markers</b> of schizo-phrenia that were identified in the Caucasian and East-Asian populations in Malaysia and assessed {{the role of}} rs 2509382, which is locat-ed at 11 q 14. 3, the mutual translocation region of the famous DISC 1 translocation [t (1; 11) (p 42. 1; q 14. 3) ]. MethodsaaWe genotyped eleven single-neucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) within or related to DISC 1 (rs 821597, rs 821616, rs 4658971, rs 1538979, rs 843979, rs 2812385, rs 1407599, rs 4658890, and rs 2509382) using the PCR-RFLP methods. ResultsaaIn all, there were 575 participants (225 schizophrenic patients and 350 healthy controls) of either Malay or Chinese ethnicity.

40|$|PDE 6 (phosphodiesterase- 6) is the {{effector}} molecule in the vertebrate phototransduction cascade. Progress {{in understanding the}} structure and function of PDE 6 has been hindered by lack of an expression system of the enzyme. Here we report ectopic expression and analysis of compartmentalization and membrane dynamics of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein of human cone PDE 6 C in rods of transgenic Xenopus laevis. EGFP-PDE 6 C is correctly targeted to the rod outer segments in transgenic Xenopus, where it displayed a characteristic striated pattern of EGFP fluorescence. Immunofluorescence labeling indicated significant and light-independent co-localization of EGFP-PDE 6 C with the <b>disc</b> rim <b>marker</b> peripherin- 2 and endogenous frog PDE 6. The diffusion of EGFP-PDE 6 C on disc membranes investigated with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was markedly slower than theoretically predicted. The enzymatic characteristics of immunoprecipitated recombinant PDE 6 C were similar to known properties of the native bovine PDE 6 C. PDE 6 C was potently inhibited by the cone- and rod-specific PDE 6 γ-subunits. Thus, transgenic Xenopus laevis is a unique expression system for PDE 6 well suited for analysis of the mechanisms of visual diseases linked to PDE 6 mutations...|$|R

Three receptor types were found whose {{spectral sensitivity}} functions followed a rhodopsin-like photopigment absorption function with A,,, ^ values at 348 nm (ultraviolet receptor), 436 nm (blue receptor) and 572 nm (green receptor). The Amax of the green receptor in Osmia rufa is shifted to much longer wavelengths compared with other insect species.

The colour signals were filter discs (70 mm in diameter) with a hole (10 mm in diameter) in the centre and the bees quickly learned to use the coloured <b>disc</b> as a <b>marker</b> of the nest entrance. Tests were dual forced-choice tests with two coloured discs closely positioned next to each other. 94 different tests were each repeated 5 - 15 times and were performed after training to 12 different colour signals.
