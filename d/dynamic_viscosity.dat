5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosity</b> and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E
25|$|The reyn is a British unit of <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{absolute}} (<b>dynamic)</b> <b>viscosity</b> {{of water}} is higher (order of 100 times) than that of air. This increases the drag on an object moving through water, and it requires more effort for propulsion in water relative to the speed of movement.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of liquids are {{typically}} several {{orders of magnitude}} higher than <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of gases.|$|R

30|$|The {{water content}} of the {{obtained}} bio-oils was determined via Karl Fischer titration. The pH of the samples was measured using a HM- 30 V pH meter (Toa) at room temperature. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the bio-oils were determined using a VM- 10 A-L viscometer (Sekonic) at 40  °C.|$|R
25|$|The cgs {{physical}} unit for <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosity,</b> the poise (P), is also named after Jean Poiseuille. It is more commonly expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP) since {{the latter is}} equal to the SI multiple millipascal seconds (mPa·s). For example, water at 20°C has a viscosity of 1.002mPa·s = 1.002cP.|$|E
25|$|HA is a bulky, {{negatively}} charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity {{are critical to}} voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds (VF) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF {{by an average of}} 35%, but increased their <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosity</b> by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.|$|E

50|$|Many {{challenges}} {{are presented with}} {{the production of the}} extra heavy crude oil located in the Miocene tar sands. For starters, the extra heavy crudes have an average specific gravity of 4 to 16 °API, along with <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of 10,000 centipoise. These viscosities are equivalent to that of corn syrup, explaining the low recovery rates throughout the field.|$|R

40|$|During the {{injection}} of the propellant in a regenerative liquid propellant gun the LP temperature rises due to adiabatic LP compression in the reservoir and to frictional processes in slits and near nozzle walls. Under adverse conditions these heating effects can cause LP reactions at locations outside the combustion chamber. Using a two-stage test fixture, the temperature increase during compression was measured, e. g., for isopropylnitrate, nitromethane, methanol, and petroleum. In addition, the nozzle wall temperature was recorded for different flow velocities, nozzle geometries and <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the fluids...|$|R

In this work, binary and ternary blends of palm oil, biodiesel, and diesel fuel were prepared, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> and densities of blends were measured as functions of temperature.

40|$|The {{correlation}} of quasistatic and dynamic relaxations was discussed {{in a typical}} strong Zr 55 Al 10 Ni 5 Cu 30 metallic glass from room temperature to Tg. The quasistatic relaxation behavior, investigated by high temperature compressive testing at a constant strain rate, was compared with dynamic tensile relaxation behavior. A correlation equation of the dynamic frequency and quasistatic strain rate was successfully deduced, and then its validity was experimentally confirmed in a fragile metallic glass. Using this correlation, the Cox–Merz rule, derived for correlating the steady-state and <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the polymers, {{is found to be}} applicable to metallic glasses...|$|R

Bleed oils were extracted from the greases and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> were measured.

40|$|The shear and extensional <b>viscosities,</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities,</b> {{and normal}} forces {{of a series}} of {{polyacrylamide}} solutions of varying molar mass have been determined in a Boger fluid at varying concentrations. The critical strain rate under extensional flow that can be defined from the departure from Newtonian behavior, εc, was found to be independent of the concentration and varied {{in the same way as}} the critical coil−stretch strain rate with the molar mass. A quantitative comparison indicated that εc is a decade lower than the strain rate predicted to characterize the coil−stretch transition. This difference indicates that εc reflects the average deformation of the chains over the range of strain rates...|$|R

Densities, <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities,</b> refractive indices, and surface tensions have been measured for each liquid {{as a function}} of temperature at atmospheric pressure and fitted using simple empirical correlation functions. Consistent with related imidazolium-based ionic liquids, an increase in the carbon side-chain length of the imidazolium cation was found to decrease the density and surface tension but increase the viscosity and refractive index. Cytotoxicities of the present liquids were found to decrease with increasing carbon side chain length and were broadly similar to those of other ionic liquids...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} thermal, thermodynamic, thermophysical and surface {{properties}} of eight ionic liquids with fluorinated alkyl side chain lengths equal {{or greater than}} four carbon atoms. Melting and decomposition temperatures were determined together with experimental densities, surface tensions, refractive indices, <b>dynamic</b> <b>viscosities</b> and ionic conductivities in a temperature interval ranging from (293. 15 to 353. 15) K. The surface properties of these fluorinated ionic liquids were discussed and several thermodynamic functions, as well as critical temperatures, were estimated. Coefficients of isobaric thermal expansion, molecular volumes and free volume effects were calculated from experimental values of density and refractive index and compared with previous data. Finally, Walden plots were {{used to evaluate the}} ionicity of the investigated ionic liquids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
