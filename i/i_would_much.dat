5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{told the}} Irish Ambassador to London in 1946, [...] "I {{said a few}} words in {{parliament}} the other day about your country because I still hope for a united Ireland. You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country." [...] He later said [...] "You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't {{want to go there}} at all, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{completed}} in August 1981, its release was delayed {{for a whole year}} until the group felt ready to release it. Gartside defended the decision to hold back the album, saying that [...] "we could have released it then, and it would probably have got some nice reviews, sold a few thousand copies and disappeared. But we thought that if we held on to it, put out 'The [...] "Sweetest Girl"', built on that a bit, took some more singles off the album, built up the interest and then put it out, it would do a lot more. Seeing as we were really pleased with it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather that happened." ...|$|E
60|$|ANNYS Perhaps I'm {{not going}} to win. [She goes to him, smiling.] I hope you'll win. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> rather you won.|$|R
6000|$|The Prince {{answered}} at once, 'I {{have heard}} so much of your beauty and kindness, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> like to enter your service.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, and it {{was very}} good, uncle; but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> rather have gone without it than shoot the beaver the tail belonged to." ...|$|R
2500|$|Carnegie {{was tried}} on 2 August 1728 for premeditated murder, a charge {{supported}} by [...] "long arguments and quotations of authority," [...] as was common at that time. The accused man swore that as God was his witness {{he had no}} grudge against the earl, but instead he had had the greatest kindness and respect for him. [...] "If it shall appear," [...] he had said, [...] "that I was the unlucky person who wounded the earl, I protest before God <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather that a sword had been sheathed in my own bowels." [...] He did not admit his guilt except to say: [...] "I had the misfortune that day to be mortally drunk, for which I beg God’s pardon." [...] Carnegie said that in this state he did not remember seeing the earl {{when he came out}} of the ditch.|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1996 Skunkhour {{embarked}} on a 10-week tour of Europe. However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get going on this new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure this is what he was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do <b>much</b> to warn my father, and the {{excellent}} Pathfinder, {{and all the}} rest, of the danger they are in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are absurd," [...] she declared, [...] "and {{you must}} go away. Really! The Baroness will be home directly. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> rather {{that she did not}} find you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, indifferently, [...] "we hope {{he will be}} successful. The man pleases me, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> like to {{know what}} Grant thinks about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me get out, then; and pray, pray {{take the}} carriage. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> sooner do {{anything}} than go in it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather walk. I {{am sure you}} will be ill!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can do as you like, Charlotte," [...] Eleanor said feebly; [...] "but for my part <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather go on as we are. We don't know now that the will really exists, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather go on {{thinking}} {{that there is a}} doubt about it." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{with that}} answer he left me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather he had knocked me down.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you have}} {{taught him to}} keep himself in order, that's the great thing, Mrs. King; if he has sound principles, and honours you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hope <b>much</b> for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I ask no money, father. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>would</b> pay <b>much</b> to be {{far away}} to-night. I ask only that I may {{be allowed to speak}} with this girl before she dies.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To oblige you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do <b>much</b> more unwelcome biddings," [...] he replied, with {{a slight}} colour; [...] "but I believe you are right; and, having {{discharged}} my duty here, I will retire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; my {{suggestion}} was really generous, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather you both remained and saw Mr. Prescott proved innocent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> prefer {{discussing}} it openly and honestly. My own impression is, that I had better leave it alone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather stay here. Every {{one would}} be strange to me, and {{having nothing to do}} I should feel in the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss De Stancy breathed more freely. 'Yes, {{we will be}} that, of course; we {{are always}} that, William. But I hope I can be your ally, and be quite neutral; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> rather.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fifty guilders {{would mean}} ease {{and comfort to}} my father and to me for many months to come. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do <b>much</b> for fifty guilders but I cannot tell that which I do not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have large}} {{discretionary}} powers. We {{have a very}} strong branch over on this side, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> rather induce you to stay here without applying to them." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{am going}} too far, and perhaps making {{an enemy of}} a reader when <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> prefer to have him (or her) for a friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you insist. In fact, there's {{an invoice}} here. Still, after the little kindnesses you have shown me <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> sooner {{not let you}} see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ludlow said, [...] "Why, I think Mrs. Rangeley is right. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather {{yield to}} compulsion. I don't mind telling what kept me, if I'm obliged to." ...|$|E
6000|$|I:4:35 [...] KING. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do <b>much</b> [...] To please thee. I'm {{prepared}} {{to bear the}} brunt [...] Of Hungary's ire; but do not urge, Solisa, [...] Beyond capacity of sufferance [...] My temper's proof.|$|R
6000|$|... "A woman's fears only, dear," [...] she admitted, as {{she gave}} him her hands. [...] "Why did nature make my sex pessimists and yours optimists, <b>I</b> wonder? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> rather look towards the sun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bear witness, my Lord, that I have {{no desire}} to fight with you," [...] said I, with what coolness I could muster. [...] "But there is one here <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give <b>much</b> for a chance to run through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I suppose I must do it, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather not. Still, as you say, it {{were best}} {{to get it all}} over at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Otter," [...] {{said the}} voice with a ghastly attempt at a laugh, [...] "but if {{it is all the}} same, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather that you came alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} it is my duty to go, Miss Armstrong. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>much</b> rather stay, I can assure you, but it's {{possible}} some of the garrisons may be holding out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctors {{could do}} nothing for the child," [...] he said, while {{returning}} with Adams to his house; [...] "but he is rather to be envied than pitied. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give <b>much</b> for the rest which he apparently has found." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everyone to his taste, Matteo. For my part, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> very <b>much</b> {{rather have}} been at work here all night {{watching}} the cargo got in and checking it off, than have been standing about doing nothing in the palace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} now," [...] she said, {{standing}} up, [...] "but must {{we go to}} Dorchester House? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> so <b>much</b> rather go straight home. I have not had {{such a good time}} since I have been in London." ...|$|R
