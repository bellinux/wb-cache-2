2500|$|In September 2003, Amiot Métayer {{was found}} dead, his eyes shot out and his <b>heart</b> <b>cut</b> out, {{most likely the}} result of machete-inflicted wounds. He was, prior to his death, {{the leader of the}} Gonaives gang known as [...] "The Cannibal Army." [...] After his death, his brother Buteur Métayer swore vengeance against those he felt {{responsible}} for Amiot's death—namely, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Buteur took charge of the Cannibal Army and promptly renamed it the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Haiti. It has been claimed by Louis Rosario of the Dominican Republic's investigation committee that the United States government helped fund and train the Haitian rebels. He was quoted saying, [...] "200 soldiers of the US Special Forces arrived in the Dominican Republic, with the authorization of Dominican President Hipolito Mejia, {{as a part of the}} military operation to train Haitian rebels," [...] when unveiling the report in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo. On 5 February 2004, this rebel group seized control of Haiti's fourth-largest city, Gonaïves, marking the beginning of a minor revolt against Aristide. During their sack of the city, they burned the police station and looted it for weapons and vehicles, which they used to continue their campaign down the coast. By 22 February, the rebels had captured Haiti's second-largest city, Cap-Haïtien. As the end of February approached, rebels threatened to take the capital, Port-au-Prince, fueling increasing political unrest and the building of barricades throughout the capital. Haitians fled their country on boats, seeking to get to the United States. After a three-week rebellion, Aristide involuntarily left Haiti on a US plane accompanied by US security personnel as the rebels took over the capital and was flown without knowledge of his route and destination, via Antigua to Bangui, Central African Republic.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{sacrifice}} was practiced on a {{grand scale}} throughout the Aztec empire, although the exact figures are unknown. At Tenochtitlán, the principal Aztec city, according to Ross Hassig [...] "between 10,000 and 80,400 persons" [...] were sacrificed over the course of four days for the dedication of the Great Pyramid in 1487. Excavations of the offerings in the main temple has provided some insight in the process, but the dozens of remains excavated are far short of the thousands of sacrifices recorded by eyewitnesses and other historical accounts. For millennia, the practice of human sacrifice was widespread in Mesoamerican and South American cultures. It was a theme in the Olmec religion, which thrived between 1200 BC and 400 BC and among the Maya. Human sacrifice was a very complex ritual. Every sacrifice had to be meticulously planned from the type of victim to specific ceremony needed for the god. The sacrificial victims were usually warriors but sometimes slaves, depending upon the god and needed ritual. The higher the rank of the warrior the better he is looked at as a sacrifice. The victim(s) would then take on the persona of the god he was to be sacrificed for. The victim(s) would be housed, fed, and dressed accordingly. This process could last up to a year. When the sacrificial day arrived, the victim(s) would participate in the specific ceremonies of the god. These ceremonies were used to exhaust the victim so that he would not struggle during the ceremony. Then five priests, known as the Tlenamacac, performed the sacrifice usually {{at the top of a}} pyramid. The victim would be laid upon the table, held down and then have his <b>heart</b> <b>cut</b> out.|$|E

6000|$|SCENE I.--LORD FOPPINGTON's Lodgings. Enter LORD FOPPINGTON, and LA VAROLE. Lord Fop. Hey, fellow, let thy vis-a-vis {{come to the}} door. La Var. Will your lordship venture so soon {{to expose}} {{yourself}} to the weather? Lord Fop. Sir, I will venture as soon as I can expose myself to the ladies. La Var. I wish your lordship would please to keep house a little longer; I'm afraid your honour does not well consider your wound. Lord Fop. My wound!--I {{would not be in}} eclipse another day, though I had as many wounds in my body as I have had in my heart. So mind, Varole, let these cards be left as directed; for this evening I shall wait on my future father-in-law, Sir Tunbelly, and I mean to commence my devoirs to the lady, by giving an entertainment at her father's expense; and hark thee, tell Mr. Loveless I request he and his company will honour me with their presence, or I shall think we are not friends. La Var. I will be sure, milor. [Exit.] Enter TOM FASHION. Fash. Brother, your servant; how do you find yourself to-day? Lord Fop. So well that I have ardered my coach to the door--so there's no danger of death this baut, Tam. Fash. I'm very glad of it. Lord Fop. [Aside.] That I believe a lie.-- [Aloud.] Pr'ythee, Tam, tell me one thing--did not your <b>heart</b> <b>cut</b> a caper up to your mauth, when you heard I was run through the bady? Fash. Why do you think it should? Lord Fop. Because I remember mine did so when I heard my uncle was shot through the head. Fash. It, then, did very ill. Lord Fop. Pr'ythee, why so? Fash. Because he used you very well. Lord Fop. Well!--Naw, strike me dumb! he starved me; he has let me want a thausand women for want of a thausand paund. Fash. Then he hindered you from making a great many ill bargains; for I think no woman worth money that will take money. Lord Fop. If I was a younger brother I should think so too. Fash. Then you are seldom much in love? Lord Fop. Never, stap my vitals! Fash. Why, then, did you make all this bustle about Amanda? Lord Fop. Because she's a woman of insolent virtue, and I thought myself piqued in honour to debauch her. Fash. Very well.--[Aside.] Here's a rare fellow for you, to have the spending of ten thousand pounds a year! But now for my business with him.--[Aloud.] Brother, though I know to talk of any business (especially of money) is a theme not quite so entertaining to you as that of the ladies, my necessities are such, I hope you'll have patience to hear me. Lord Fop. The greatness of your necessities, Tam, is the worst argument in the waurld for your being patiently heard. I do believe you are going to make a very good speech, but, strike me dumb! it has the worst beginning of any speech I have heard this twelvemonth. Fash. I'm sorry you think so. Lord Fop. I do believe thou art: but, come, let's know the affair quickly. Fash. Why, then, my case, in a word, is this: the necessary expenses of my travels have so much exceeded the wretched income of my annuity, that I have been forced to mortgage it for five hundred pounds, which is spent. So unless you are so kind as to assist me in redeeming it, I know no remedy but to take a purse. Lord Fop. Why, faith, Tam, to give you my sense of the thing, I do think taking a purse the best remedy in the waurld; for if you succeed, you are relieved that way, if you are taken [Drawing his hand round his neck], you are relieved t'other. Fash. I'm glad to see you are in so pleasant a humour; I hope I shall find the effects on't. Lord Fop. Why, do you then really think it a reasonable thing, that I should give you five hundred paunds? Fash. I do not ask it as a due, brother; I am willing to receive it as a favour. Lord Fop. Then thou art willing to receive it anyhow, strike me speechless! But these are damned times to give money in; taxes are so great, repairs so exorbitant, tenants such rogues, and bouquets so dear, that the devil take me I'm reduced to that extremity in my cash, I have been forced to retrench in that one article of sweet pawder, till I have brought it down to five guineas a maunth--now judge, Tam, whether I can spare you five paunds. Fash. If you can't I must starve, that's all.-- [Aside.] Damn him! Lord Fop. All I can say is, you should have been a better husband. Fash. Ouns! if you can't live upon ten thousand a year, how do you think I should do't upon two hundred? Lord Fop. Don't be in a passion, Tam, for passion is the most unbecoming thing in the waurld--to the face. Look you, I don't love to say anything to you to make you melancholy, but upon this occasion I must take leave to put you in mind that a running horse does require more attendance than a coach-horse. Nature has made some difference twixt you and me. Fash. Yes--she has made you older.--[Aside.] Plague take her. Lord Fop. That is not all, Tam. Fash. Why, what is there else? Lord Fop. [Looks first on himself and then on his brother.] Ask the ladies. Fash. Why, thou essence-bottle, thou musk-cat! dost thou then think thou hast any advantage over me but what Fortune has given thee? Lord Fop. I do, stap my vitals! Fash. Now, by all that's great and powerful, thou art the prince of coxcombs! Lord Fop. Sir, I am proud at being at the head of so prevailing a party. Fash. Will nothing provoke thee?--Draw, coward! Lord Fop. Look you, Tam, you know I have always taken you for a mighty dull fellow, and here is one of the foolishest plats broke out that I have seen a lang time. Your poverty makes life so burdensome to you, you would provoke me to a quarrel, in hopes either to slip through my lungs into my estate, or to get yourself run through the guts, {{to put an end to}} your pain. But I will disappoint you in both your designs; far, with the temper of a philasapher, and the discretion of a statesman--I shall leave the room with my sword in the scabbard. [Exit.] Fash. So! farewell, brother; and now, conscience, I defy thee. Lory! Enter LORY. Lory. Sir! Fash. Here's rare news, Lory; his lordship has given me a pill has purged off all my scruples. Lory. Then my heart's at ease again: for I have been in a lamentable fright, sir, ever since your conscience had the impudence to intrude into your company. Fash. Be at peace; it will come there no more: my brother has given it a wring by the nose, and I have kicked it downstairs. So run away to the inn, get the chaise ready quickly, and bring it to Dame Coupler's without a moment's delay. Lory. Then, sir, you are going straight about the fortune? Fash. I am.--Away--fly, Lory! Lory. The happiest day I ever saw. I'm upon the wing already. Now then I shall get my wages. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
