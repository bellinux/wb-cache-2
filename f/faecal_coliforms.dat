The study has been undertaken in the Agra city of Yamuna sub-basin. In this context, sampling sites (3 nos) namely Pandav Nagar, Ayodhya Kunj and Laxmi Nagar were selected for sampling. The groundwater samples were analyzed for major cations, anions and <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform.</b> Critical parameters namely chloride, nitrate and <b>Faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> were considered {{to assess the impact of}} the On-site sanitation systems. The analytical results shown that except for chloride, most of the samples exceeded the Bureau of Indian Standard limits for drinking water for all the other analyzed parameters, i.e., nitrate and <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> in the first two sites. In Laxmi Nagar, except for <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform,</b> all the samples are below the BIS limits. In all the three sites, <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> was found in majority of the samples.

30|$|The sites at Agra are {{characterized}} by alluvial setting. It appears that the septic tanks have not able to contain the contamination by coliform. However, they do indicate significant concentration of nitrate and <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform.</b> The nitrate concentration exceeds the BIS permissible limit (45  mg/L) and hence the situation is alarming for the two localities, namely, Pandav Nagar and Ayodhya Kunj. It is observed that the densely populated locality of Ayodhya Kunj recorded high concentration of nitrate (range 29 – 220  mg/L) as compared to Pandav Nagar and Laxmi Nagar which are relatively less populated. The samples are contaminated by <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> in both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. As the soil type is mostly coarse sand, in which the movement of contaminants will be faster as compared to fine sand, the aquifer is affected more due to the coarse sand structure. The findings are contrary to those from other alluvial areas like Lucknow (Jangam et al. 2015) and Kolkata (Pujari et al. 2012). As per the BIS guidelines, <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> should be absent to render the water potable. Hence, there is health risk due to presence of <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the sanitary quality of three freshwater springs by estimating the concentration of total <b>coliform</b> (TC) and <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> (FC) bacteria as pollution indicators. Water samples were collected twice a month during the period August 2008 to January 2009; from springs on the island of Upolu, Samoa. For bacteriological analysis, the membrane filtration method was used for the two groups of bacteria. All samples from the three sites were found contaminated with total <b>coliform</b> and <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> bacteria and the counts were higher than the maximum microbial contaminant level established by World Health Organization (WHO). The results imply that the springs were heavily polluted by bacteria of faecal origin suggesting that, these springs are potential sources of health hazards which is important from a public health perspective.

It is a symptom of infection caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms most of which can be spread by contaminated water. Diarrhoea prevalence rate for the children in Dhaka slums is 214. 29. The total costs of children’s diarrhoea (adding all the direct and indirect) in Dhaka slums is Tk. 133. 88 over a 15 day time interval. The water quality is measured at the point-of-use and the point-of-source by the total <b>coliform,</b> <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform,</b> and <b>faecal</b> streptococci tests per 100 ml water.

40|$|Three {{different}} approaches for establishing {{guidelines for the}} microbiological quality of treated wastewater that is reused for agriculture are reviewed. These approaches have different objectives as their outcomes: the absence of faecal indicator organisms in the wastewater, {{the absence of a}} measurable excess of cases of enteric disease in the exposed population and a model-generated estimated risk below a defined acceptable risk. If the second approach (using empirical epidemiological studies supplemented by microbiological studies of the transmission of pathogens) is used in conjunction with the third approach (using a model-based quantitative risk assessment for selected pathogens) a powerful tool is produced that aids the development of regulations.

30|$|Coliform {{group of}} {{bacteria}} are indicators of pathogenic organisms {{and the presence}} of coliform in water is an indicator of contamination of human or animal faecal waste.

40|$|Background: In Addis Ababa, where {{irrigation}} water for vegetable production is commonly {{derived from the}} highly polluted Akaki river, information on microbial contamination of water and irrigated vegetable is scanty. An assessment was done to determine the microbiological quality of {{irrigation water}} and lettuce harvested from 10 urban farming sites of Addis Ababa. The efficacy of 5 lettuce washing methods were also assessed. A total of 210 lettuce and 90 irrigation water samples were analyzed for <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> and helminth eggs population levels. Results: The mean <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> levels of irrigation water ranged from 4. 29 - 5. 61 log 10 MPN 100 ml- 1, while on lettuce, the concentrations ranged from 3. 46 - 5. 03 log 10 MPN 100 g- 1. Helminth eggs and larvae were detected in 80 % of irrigation water and 61 % of lettuce samples. Numbers ranged from 0. 9 - 3. 1 eggs 1000 ml- 1 and 0. 8 - 3. 7 eggs 100 g- 1 wet weight for irrigation water and lettuce, respectively. The helminth eggs identified included those of Ascaris lumbricoides, Hookworm, Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia and Strongloyides larvae. Ascaris lumbricoides and Hookworm were most prevalent in both irrigation water and lettuce samples. Compared with the WHO recommendations and international standards, the <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> and helminth eggs levels in irrigation water and lettuce samples exceeded the recommended levels. Irrespective of the tested washing methods, <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> and helminth eggs levels were somehow reduced. Among the washing methods, potable tap water washing - rinsing (2 min) followed by dipping in 15 000 ppm vinegar solution for a minute supported the highest faecal coliorm reduction of 1. 7 log 10 units, whereas lowest reduction of 0. 8 log 10 units was achieved for the same procedure without vinegar. Conclusion: Compared with international standards, both <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> and helminth eggs levels exceeded recommended thresholds in water and lettuce, but still in a potential risk range which can be easily mitigated if farmers and households {{are aware of the}} potential risk. Aside preventing occupational exposure, potential risk reduction programs should target households which have so far no guidance on how best to wash vegetables. The result of the present study suggest that the vinegar based washing methods are able to reduce <b>faecal</b> <b>coliform</b> towards low level while the physical washing with running water may help to substantially decrease potential risk of helminth parasitic infections...|$|R
