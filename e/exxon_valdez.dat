5|$|He left Third Mate Gregory Cousins {{in charge}} of the {{navigation}} bridge and Able Seaman Robert Kagan at the helm with instructions from the third mate to return to the southbound traffic lane in the TSS at a prearranged point. <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> failed to return to the shipping lanes and struck Bligh Reef at around 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989. The accident resulted in the discharge of around 11 million gallons of oil, 20% of the cargo, into Prince William Sound.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> {{oil spill}} {{adversely}} affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod {{disappeared in the}} following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered {{part of a larger}} population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} has {{at times}} been damaged due to sabotage, human error, maintenance failures, and natural disasters. By law, Alyeska {{is required to}} report significant oil spills to regulatory authorities. The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill is the best-known accident involving Alaska oil, {{but it did not}} involve the pipeline itself. Following the spill, Alyeska created a rapid response force that is paid for by the oil companies, including ExxonMobil, which was found liable for the spill.|$|E
5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E
5|$|By age 32, {{he was the}} {{youngest}} captain working for Exxon when he took command of Exxon Philadelphia, a California-to-Alaska oil tanker, in 1978. In 1985 he was master of Exxon Chester when the asphalt carrier ran into a storm during its New York to South Carolina trip. High winds damaged the ship's mast including radar and radio communications antennas. Though the crew was prepared to abandon ship, Hazelwood rallied them and guided the ship to safety. In 1987, he became the alternate master of <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> which subsequently received Exxon Fleet safety awards for the year of 1987 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> {{departed}} {{the port}} of Valdez, Alaska at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 million gallons of crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|E
5|$|Hazelwood's driver's license {{had been}} {{suspended}} or revoked three {{times by the}} state of New York for alcohol violations since 1984. At the time of the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> incident, his New York state driving privileges were suspended {{as a result of a}} driving under the influence arrest on September 13, 1988. He entered a rehabilitation program in 1985 at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, New York. Following rehabilitation he received 90 days of leave to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, but it is not clear if he attended during that leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E
5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E
25|$|On March 24, 1989, the {{oil tanker}} <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> ran aground on Bligh Reef, {{spilling}} eleven {{million gallons of}} crude oil into the waters of Prince William Sound. The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill was the largest in United States history.|$|E

25|$|In March 1989 the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> {{oil tanker}} ran aground on Bligh Reef {{northwest}} of Cordova causing {{one of the}} most devastating environmental disasters in North America. The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill severely affected the area's salmon and herring populations leading to a recession of the local fishing-reliant economy as well as disrupting the general ecology of the area. After many years of litigation, 450 million dollars were awarded for compensatory and punitive damages.|$|E

25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez.</b> This means that the oil {{is less likely to}} heavily coat nearby beaches, flora and fauna, however the tanker was carrying more oil than the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> incident spilled in total, so {{there was a lot of}} concern about the oil not being able to evaporate if the slick became too thick.|$|E

25|$|Palast {{has also}} taken {{issue with the}} {{official}} story behind the grounding of the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez,</b> claiming the sobriety of the Valdezs captain {{was not an issue}} in the accident. According to Palast, the main cause of the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill in 1989 was not human error, but an Exxon decision not to use the ship's radar in order to save money. The Raytheon Raycas radar system would not have detected Bligh Reef itself - as radar, unlike sonar, is incapable of detecting submerged objects. The radar system would have detected the radar reflector, placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping vessels on course via radar.|$|E

25|$|The 1968 {{discovery}} of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 {{completion of the}} Trans-Alaska Pipeline led to an oil boom. In 1989, the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> hit a reef in Prince William Sound, spilling between 11 and 34 million US gallons (42,000 and 130,000 m³) of crude oil over 1,100miles (1,600km) of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation {{is seen in the}} contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> {{oil spill}} was the {{incentive}} to introduce legislation requiring tankers to have a double hull, a measure that is not seen as the best solution by all experts. Where a double hull should minimize the consequences after a disaster, Concordia Maritime developed the Stena V-MAX, a VLCC with two propellers, two rudders and two redundant engine rooms, where a single fault does not result in loss of steering, reducing {{the chances of a}} grounding.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} environmental {{repercussions of}} oil production became {{clear in the}} <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill of 1989. On March 24, the tanker <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> ran aground in Prince William Sound, releasing 11 million gallons of crude oil into the water, spreading along 1,100miles (1,800km) of shoreline. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at least 300,000 sea birds, 2,000 otters, and other marine animals died because of the spill. Exxon spent US$2 billion on cleaning {{up in the first}} year alone. Exxon, working with state and federal agencies, continued its cleanup into the early 1990s. Government studies show that the oil and the cleaning process itself did long-term harm to the ecology of the Sound, interfering with the reproduction of birds and animals in ways that still aren't fully understood. Prince William Sound seems to have recuperated, but scientists still dispute the extent of the recovery. In a civil settlement, Exxon agreed to pay $900 million in ten annual payments, plus an additional $100 million for newly discovered damages. In a class action suit against Exxon, a jury awarded punitive damages of US$5 billion, but as of 2008 no money has been disbursed and appellate litigation continues.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} energy accidents, {{hydroelectric}} plants {{were responsible for}} the most fatalities, but nuclear power plant accidents rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent. Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill (Alaska), the Prestige oil spill (Spain), and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident (Pennsylvania).|$|E
25|$|A {{recent report}} by the Galicia-based Barrie de la Maza {{economic}} institute criticised the Spanish government's handling of the catastrophe. It estimated the cost of the clean-up to the Galician coast alone at €2.5 billion. However, a court ruling in 2013 put the cost of the disaster at 368 million euros ($494 million) to the Spanish state, 145 million euros to the Spanish region of Galicia and 68 million euros to France. The clean-up of the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> cost US$3 billion (almost €2.2 billion).|$|E
25|$|Collapsed or {{collapsing}} dorsal fins {{are rare}} in most wild populations and usually {{result from a}} serious injury to the fin, such as from being shot or colliding with a vessel. After the 1989 <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill, the dorsal fins of two male resident killer whales who {{had been exposed to}} the oil collapsed, and the animals subsequently died. In 2002, the dorsal fin of a stranded killer whale showed signs of collapse after three days but regained its natural upright appearance as soon as the orca resumed strong normal swimming upon release.|$|E
25|$|In {{dealing with}} the environment, Bush reauthorized the Clean Air Act. The {{legislation}} sought to curb acid rain and smog by requiring decreased emissions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide. The measure {{was the first major}} update to the Clean Air Act since 1977, and {{was the result of a}} compromise between Congress and Bush. Bush also signed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill. However, the League of Conservation Voters criticized some of Bush's other environmental actions, including his opposition to stricter auto-mileage standards.|$|E
25|$|ExxonMobil {{has been}} criticized for its slow {{response}} to cleanup efforts after the 1989 <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill in Alaska, widely considered {{to be one of the}} world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment. ExxonMobil has a history of lobbying for climate change denial and against the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The company has also been the target of accusations of improperly dealing with human rights issues, influence on American foreign policy, and its impact on the future of nations.|$|E
25|$|Crude oil {{and refined}} fuel spills from tanker ship {{accidents}} have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans, Ogoniland, {{and many other}} places. The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, Atlantic Empress, Amoco Cadiz), but volume is a limited barometer of damage or impact. Smaller spills have already proven {{to have a great}} impact on ecosystems, such as the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill because of the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of an emergency environmental response.|$|E
25|$|In 1982–1989, the Canmar drillships drilled only 10 wells for Dome Petroleum {{and other}} oil {{companies}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In addition, four more wells were drilled by the drillships in the Alaskan waters in 1985–1991. Other wells were drilled from artificial drilling islands as well as novel drilling systems such as Kulluk and the single steel drilling caisson. While a number {{of oil and gas}} discoveries were made, none of the findings were sufficient to warrant commercial production. Following the falling oil prices in the 1980s and the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill in 1989, hydrocarbon exploration in the Beaufort Sea and the MacKenzie Delta gradually ended. Robert LeMeur was reportedly laid up in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Forms {{of credit}} default swaps {{had been in}} {{existence}} from at least the early 1990s, with early trades carried out by Bankers Trust in 1991. J.P.

Morgan had extended a $4.8billion credit line to Exxon, which faced the threat of $5billion in punitive damages for the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> oil spill. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Blythe Masters then sold the credit risk from the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in order to cut the reserves that J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon's default, thus improving its own balance sheet.|$|E
