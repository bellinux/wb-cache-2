5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle. Subsequently the summer grazing was used <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. This {{has led to a}} regeneration of the island's vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically to rest and chew their cud. Ideal pasture <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|$|E

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport {{was used as a}} pasture <b>for</b> <b>sheep.</b> The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 19467–48. While there were initially many customers, the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks. Underwood's initial research was into {{the effects of}} sulfur on wool growth, he followed that research with investigations into botulism in sheep during 1935. These experiments were {{the first of many}} by Underwood over the next 30 years. During the 1940s he studied the nutritional value of hay and pasture <b>for</b> <b>sheep,</b> the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{colonisation}} of Australia by the British, the 19th century saw {{the initial}} European exploration and {{settlement of the}} area and their encounters with the local indigenous peoples, beginning with the first explorations in 1820 and shortly followed by the first European settlements in 1824. At the outset the region was dominated by large properties used <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> and cattle grazing, which had been granted to free settlers that had arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom and other European countries. These large properties were later broken up and subdivided in accordance with changes to land tenure arrangements, smaller farms and urban developments becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|Other than forage, {{the other}} staple feed <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> is hay, often {{during the winter}} months. The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet. Also {{included}} in some sheep's diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks. Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep. The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{undergraduate}} gossip sheet {{is entitled}} The Sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people's supposed penchant <b>for</b> <b>sheep.</b> Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus {{because it is}} seen as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having a majority of Welsh members until well into the 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9million {{out of a total of}} 58.8million at the time of the 2001 Census).|$|E

5|$|Virtually {{the entire}} land {{area of the}} islands is used as pasture <b>for</b> <b>sheep.</b> Introduced species include reindeer, hares, rabbits, Patagonian foxes, brown rats and cats. The {{detrimental}} impact several of these species have caused to native flora and fauna has led authorities to attempt to contain, remove or exterminate invasive species such as foxes, rabbits and rats. Endemic land animals {{have been the most}} affected by introduced species. The extent of human impact on the Falklands is unclear, since there is little long-term data on habitat change.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used <b>for</b> <b>sheep,</b> deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died {{while he was a}} toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> pasture and growing cocksfoot. When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch. Frank attended Fendalton School and marked his final year of schooling by being made head boy.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to analyze the {{coefficient}} of phenotypic correlation and regression between main wool production traits <b>for</b> the <b>sheep</b> belonging to the Palas line specialized for meat, milk and with high prolificacy. The study was performed on a 10 years interval, the phenotypic correlation and the regression being determined for age groups and body weight classes for the following traits: raw wool production, the staple length, wool diameter and body weight at shearing. The obtained results are showing that <b>for</b> the specialized <b>sheep</b> lines the efficiency of wool production is also higher <b>for</b> the <b>sheep</b> with moderate body weights but <b>for</b> these <b>sheep</b> lines the selection for body weight will be done based on the morphoproductive parameters specific to the purpose of exploitation (milk production, meat production or high prolificacy) ...|$|R

5|$|One {{result of}} these changes were the Highland Clearances, by which much of the {{population}} of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. Many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue. Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis, when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846. Some 150,000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster. They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland, but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E

5|$|This period saw {{a process}} of {{rehabilitation}} for Highland culture. In the 1820s, {{as part of the}} Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. However, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. The desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the Highland Clearances, in which much {{of the population of the}} Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used <b>for</b> <b>sheep</b> farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.|$|E
