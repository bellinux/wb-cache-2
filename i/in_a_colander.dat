5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two-stage}} or two-bath method, {{the first}} bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160°C / 320°F) to cook them through. This may {{be done in}} advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190°C / 375°F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend {{on the size of}} the potatoes. For example, for 2–3mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.|$|E

30|$|Weight matter {{leaching}} {{was examined}} {{for the second}} dietary protein trial. The experiment was conducted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> experimental test system. Three pieces of each feed (1.0  cm 2 /piece) served as for replication, three replications per diet. They were weighed to obtain the initial weights of the three replications, then placed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> empty <b>colander</b> without opihi for 12  h. Stability of feed was assessed according to the equation: Water absorbed (%) = {(FW−IW)/IW} ×  100. Where IW is initial weight of feed, and FW is the final weight of feed of the same diet after being immersed in water. The retained feed was rinsed with fresh water and transferred to a drying oven for 12  h at 100  °C to obtain dry weight. To obtain the initial dry weight of each diet, three other pieces of each diet were weighed and dried in the oven, this dry weight served as initial dried weight control. This data {{were used to determine}} leaching losses due to soaking.|$|R

5000|$|The name maocai {{is derived}} from the verb mao ( [...] ; Chengdu dialect: [...] ) which in Sichuanese Mandarin refers to the {{blanching}} of the ingredients <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> in hot water by moving the colander up and down repeatedly.

5000|$|A food mill (also called passatutto, purée sieve, moulinette, mouli légumes, or passe-vite) is a food {{preparation}} utensil for [...] and sieving soft foods. Typically, a food mill {{consists of three}} parts: a bowl, a bottom plate with holes like those <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>colander,</b> and a crank fitted with a bent metal blade which crushes the food and forces it through {{the holes in the}} bottom plate as the crank is turned. The bottom plate may be a permanent part of the device, or interchangeable plates with different hole sizes may be supplied. Three corrugated feet on the base, or two ears on the rim plus the handle, fit on the rim of a cooking pot and hold the mill in position over it.|$|E
40|$|Henry Vincent {{was always}} a hard, irascible man, his temper soured by Peninsular War wounds and years of {{authority}} as superintendent of the Rottnest penal settlement, and his anger deepened as virility faded. After turning seventy his behaviour became increasingly trying. His eccentricities included cooking mutton chops in a tea-kettle {{and trying to make}} a pudding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>colander.</b> For some days he convinced himself that Queen Victoria was about to visit Fremantle. He roared and ranted; he smashed china and sometimes carried a loaded pistol; he accused his wife and daughters of sexual misconduct with their friends and neighbours. 2 Such a domestic tyrant could not overlook the pleasures of making and remaking his will, and towards the end of 1867 he determined to leave everything to one of his sons, the eldest of six adult children aged between 28 and eighteen. Of the few legally qualified inhabitants of Fremantle at that time he chose Henry Wells Young as his adviser...|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{invention}} of the salad spinner is considered to be modern, earlier devices, including one from the 19th century, did exist and performed similar functions. When the salad spinner was introduced to the mass market <b>in</b> the 1970s, <b>a</b> number of other techniques and products were already available and employed for the drying of vegetables and salad. One such device was a wire basket dryer, <b>in</b> essence <b>a</b> collapsible <b>colander,</b> which could be shaken or spun to expel the excess water. This method has been criticized by some for its impracticalities and according to one writer, the process was [...] "akin to standing near a dog that’s shaking himself dry." [...] Another product was a wire lettuce dryer designed for use <b>in</b> the sink. <b>A</b> basket was fixed with suction cups {{to the bottom of the}} sink, and pushing a pump caused the basket to spin around a center post, often spraying expelled water on the operator. Paper or fabric towels were also commonly used for drying salad and vegetables after washing, however the method was perceived as time-consuming and costly.|$|R

[...] Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. <b>In</b> this way, <b>a</b> cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying time machine, a duplicator or, with the attachment of a few wires and <b>a</b> <b>colander,</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Cerebral Enhance-o-tron." ...|$|R

50|$|Brown quickly {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for outlandish performances, which included {{the use of a}} burning metal helmet, that led to occasional mishaps, such as during an early appearance at the Windsor Festival in 1967, where he wore <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> on his head soaked in methanol. The fuel poured over his head by accident and caught fire; a bystander doused the flames by pouring beer on Brown's head, preventing any serious injury. The flaming head then became an Arthur Brown signature.|$|R

50|$|The buns {{are then}} baked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{cylinder}} like high heat clay oven {{that is similar}} to a tandoori oven. Burning charcoal is put at the bottom to heat the oven. The buns are then stacked one by one from bottom to top of the side of the oven vertically.
