50|$|Water {{from the}} Goulburn River is <b>diverted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Goulburn Weir and sent via the Stuart Murray and Cattanach Canals to the Waranga Basin.

50|$|The {{cause of}} Yomagate was an {{investigation}} of a cocaine trafficking operation. According to the investigation, large sums of drug money from the U.S. city of New York would have been destined to Argentina, to be laundered by various financial transactions, with the purchase of real estate, jewelry or entrepreneurship.

2500|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{inclusion}} of black Durham {{residents in the}} work force occurred during World War II, when the federal government reluctantly allowed black workers to fill up open job positions in Durham, left by those who went to fight in the war. What seemed a promising step towards civil rights efforts faded as soldiers returned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the war to reclaim their positions in society. Both black men and women lost their factory jobs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutdown</b> of several major wartime plants that were no longer needed post-war. [...] Oliver Harvey, who later led the organizational efforts of Local 77, was affected by the wartime demand for black employees.|$|R

In attempting to identify the impact of the information campaign, we face the problem that the pre-reform data was not collected with an evaluation purpose in mind.

60|$|But {{the devotion}} {{of the people}} failed not of an Immediate reward. The pestilence, which for some weeks had laid waste the town, as the saint had foretold not long before his death, {{in his letter to}} Father Francis Perez, on the sudden ceased; insomuch, that no {{infection}} was from thenceforward caught; and they, who had been infected, were cured, without taking any remedy. Besides this contagious disease, the famine raged to that degree, that multitudes of people daily died of hunger.

The main canal is 82 mi, with a total drop of 175 ft, a width of 150 ft to 700 ft and a depth of 7 ft to 50 ft The canals get smaller as they run west because they carry less water.|$|R

It was decided to establish a new bus service to the area and, as the Board was not interested in extending the trolley bus network, it was started on 15 January 1951 using petrol and diesel buses. The route ran to Acheson Avenue via Emmett Street, travelling under trolley bus lines much of the way. As <b>the</b> point <b>at</b> which this new service turned off Shirley Road into Emmett Street was close to where the Marshland Road via Richmond trolley bus route met the North Beach line, North Beach trolley buses were <b>diverted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time to run via Richmond and the Richmond trolley bus service was suspended.
