5|$|Reports in {{the news}} media of dinosaur finds and dinosaur science are often <b>inaccurate</b> and sensationalistic, and popular dinosaur books usually lag {{scientific}} understanding. Dinosaur toys and models are often <b>inaccurate,</b> packaged indiscriminately with other prehistoric animals, or have fictitious additions like the large sharp teeth in some rubber Triceratops toys.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} <b>inaccurate</b> images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and <b>inaccurate</b> views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|While {{many books}} and {{articles}} were written during the Turk's life about how it worked, most were <b>inaccurate,</b> drawing incorrect inferences from external observation.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{available}} charts of the Persian Gulf were <b>inaccurate</b> or incomplete at the time, Al Qasimi ships could hide from Wainwright's squadron in the uncharted inlets, a problem Wainwright reported {{upon his return}} that resulted in improved British cartography of the area.|$|E
5|$|English jurist Jeremy Bentham was {{a critic}} of Blackstone's {{theories}}. Others saw Blackstone's theories as <b>inaccurate</b> statements of English law, using the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Tractatus of Glanville and the 1689 Bill of Rights as particularly obvious examples of laws Blackstone omitted.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were <b>inaccurate.</b> He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly <b>inaccurate,</b> because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|The Bohr model {{exhibits}} {{difficulty for}} atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than c, {{the speed of}} light. Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is <b>inaccurate</b> when applied to such an element.|$|E
5|$|The map the Workmans {{made during}} this trip was of low quality. According to Mason, the couple {{did not have}} a good sense of {{topographical}} direction, which meant that their measurements were <b>inaccurate</b> and unusable by the Survey of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} guns, armor, ordnance, and design was {{changing}} rapidly, so experience could quickly become irrelevant. Combat {{experience in the}} Spanish–American War had shown the value of many smaller guns at close range, where the larger guns had been <b>inaccurate.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Francia's death he was {{succeeded by}} Carlos Antonio López, (called ‘López I’ by some authors, a {{convenient}} if <b>inaccurate</b> designation), {{the father of}} Francisco Solano López (‘López II’). López I did open up Paraguay to foreign trade and technology, but the steamship made his country vulnerable to invasion and he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It {{is possible that}} the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are <b>inaccurate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically <b>inaccurate.</b> He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very <b>inaccurate</b> knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first {{specimens}} were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were <b>inaccurate.</b> The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.|$|E
5|$|By 1970, {{scientists}} {{realized this}} pose was incorrect {{and could not}} have been maintained by a living animal, as it would have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The <b>inaccurate</b> AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E
5|$|Confusion arose when {{an issue}} of the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion of}} the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been <b>inaccurate,</b> suggesting that the journalist might not have been at the affair or he had reproduced a drawing of the wrong flag.|$|E
5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be <b>inaccurate</b> and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
5|$|Dreamtime was a {{controversial}} best-seller upon its initial release in West Germany, and inspired academic debate {{leading to the}} publication of Der Gläserne Zaun (1983), an anthology discussing Duerr's ideas, edited by Rolf Gehlen and Bernd Wolf. Reviews in the Anglophone world were mixed, with critics describing Dreamtime as unoriginal, factually <b>inaccurate,</b> and difficult to read, but also innovative and well referenced.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. It was believed that she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability to search for a vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was <b>inaccurate,</b> either intentionally or through error.|$|E
5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were <b>inaccurate</b> or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was <b>inaccurate.</b> This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, as part {{of plans}} to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign, the Australian II Corps—consisting of mainly Militia troops {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General Stanley Savige—took over {{responsibility}} for Allied operations on Bougainville from the American XIV Corps. Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944, initially establishing themselves around the US base at Torokina. Due to <b>inaccurate</b> intelligence, Savige mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17,500 men, and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere, rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted. However, Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly <b>inaccurate</b> and after the war {{it was found that the}} number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Many of the locations, characters, {{and events}} in Dynasty Warriors 4 are {{reported}} to have happened in Chinese history although many have been exaggerated to make the game more appealing to the player. There are also some features that are historically <b>inaccurate.</b> The game features environments resembling that of ancient China and various items from the era. Common items throughout the game include Fairy Wine and Dim Sum’s.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus {{was seldom}} {{mentioned}} during the Cold War and his pre-war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press, {{particularly in the}} US During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus {{began to appear in}} these newspapers, including Karys, Vienas iš daugelio (1950), Paskutinis žuvusiojo lakūno atvirukas (1955), and Kapitono Marcinkaus mirtis nelaisvėje (1956). The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 issue of the journal Švytūrys. Thereinafter Marcinkus's life was more frequently mentioned, although much of the information presented was <b>inaccurate</b> and incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Note: For {{the years}} after 2003, the Hockey Hall of Fame web site is accurate. The web site is <b>inaccurate</b> for the years before, for the players {{inducted}} prior {{to the establishment of}} the Toronto Hall, for example Nels Stewart, who was inducted in 1952, not 1962 as is listed on the HHOF web site. This may have led to other publications stating the wrong years of induction. The book Honoured Members: Hockey Hall of Fame, published by the Hockey Hall of Fame itself, lists the players accurately.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly <b>inaccurate.</b> The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements <b>inaccurate.</b> Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{non-specific}} {{nature of}} the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires {{a high degree of}} suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, enlarged spleen, fever, low number of platelets in the blood, and higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells. Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or <b>inaccurate</b> laboratory testing.|$|E
5|$|Public {{communication}} from Malaysian officials regarding {{the loss of}} the flight was initially beset with confusion. The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and sometimes <b>inaccurate</b> information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders. Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly <b>inaccurate</b> in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Film Library {{also held}} {{high-quality}} original film sequences made for insertion into videotaped episodes. Some of these, {{such as those}} from Episodes 1–2 of The Daleks' Master Plan, survive to this day. Other junked sequences were mistakenly entered into a film library computer system, leading to an impression that they had existed for years afterward, and <b>inaccurate</b> speculation that the BBC was still destroying clips well into the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} <b>inaccurate.</b> There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people {{had been forced to}} abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised and were able to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes <b>inaccurate.</b> It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an <b>inaccurate</b> rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E
5|$|The work of E. A. Wallis Budge, Birch's {{successor}} at the British Museum, {{is still}} in wide circulation – including both his hieroglyphic editions and his English translations of the Papyrus of Ani, though the latter are now considered <b>inaccurate</b> and out-of-date. More recent translations in English have been published by T. G. Allen (1974) and Raymond O. Faulkner (1972). As more {{work has been done}} on the Book of the Dead, more spells have been identified, and the total now stands at 192.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its existence, Christine was {{monitored}} by astronauts in the Skylab 3 project. During this project, active and passive microwave satellite imagery {{was used for}} the first time to determine the wind speed within a tropical cyclone. This was accomplished after the removal of regions of heavy rain from the data, a factor that gives <b>inaccurate</b> wind readings.|$|E
