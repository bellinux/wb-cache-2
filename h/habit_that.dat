B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and both have a form and <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is {{impossible}} to determine what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one. Such an arrangement {{may have been a}} <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> had developed during the Leiden years, as civil marriage was common in the Netherlands. However, the Pilgrims saw this arrangement as biblical, there being no evidence from Scripture that a minister should preside over a wedding.|$|E
5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been {{nothing more than}} a reaction to the impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong <b>habit,</b> <b>that</b> of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its own sake.|$|E

5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} {{large sums}} of money in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{is not a}} true coral {{in class}} Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is {{more closely related to}} {{jellyfish}} than stony corals. Because of the variability in growth <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> this coral exhibits, it {{has been the subject of}} much confusion as to its taxonomy, being described under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due to environmental factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name for all these species. This conclusion has since been questioned.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his mentor Cai E (November 1916) and of his first wife, Zhu {{developed}} a severe opium <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> afflicted him until 1922, when he underwent treatment in Shanghai. His troops continued to support him, and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord. In 1920, after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border, he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government. Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe. He first traveled to Shanghai, where he broke his opium habit and, according to historians of the Kuomintang, met Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922, but was rejected due to his being a warlord.|$|E

But voters continued their ticket-splitting <b>habit</b> <b>that</b> began statewide in 1956, by reelecting Clark narrowly over VanZandt, 2.2 million votes to 2.1 million, about 51%. With the state losing three congressional seats due to reapportionment, the Republicans had a net loss of two seats in the election, while the Democrats lost one, but the lineup was still in favor of the GOP, 14 to 13.|$|E

Somehow this prescribed peg of brandy turned into heavy drinking after her separation from her husband. Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi never formally divorced, but separated in 1964. During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E
