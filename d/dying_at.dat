5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II was <b>dying</b> <b>at</b> this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor.

5|$|Grimaldi's {{association}} with Sadler's Wells {{came to an}} end in 1820, chiefly {{as a result of his}} deteriorating relationship with the theatre's management. After numerous injuries over the years from his energetic clowning, his health was also declining rapidly, and he retired in 1823. He appeared occasionally on stage for a few years thereafter, but his performances were restricted by his worsening physical disabilities. In his last years, Grimaldi lived in relative obscurity and became a depressed, impoverished alcoholic.

5|$|Captain Renaudin, of Généreux, and Joseph Allemand, of Ville de Marseille, {{were both}} honourably acquitted during the {{automatic}} court-martial {{for the loss}} of their ships. The French Navy made no further efforts to reach Malta, and all subsequent efforts by French warships to break out the port were met by the blockade, only one frigate breaking through and reaching France. Without the supplies carried on Perrée's convoy, starvation and disease spread throughout the garrison {{and by the end of}} August 1800, French soldiers were <b>dying</b> <b>at</b> a rate of 100 a day. On 4 September, Vaubois finally capitulated, turning the island over to the British, who retained it for the next 164 years.|$|E
5|$|Chartwell is {{a country}} house {{near the town of}} Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the {{property}} in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, <b>dying</b> <b>at</b> his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's first exile {{was to be}} a short one. In early July 1307, Edward I {{fell ill}} while once more campaigning in the north, and lay <b>dying</b> <b>at</b> Burgh by Sands near the Scottish border. According to one chronicle, he {{gathered}} some of his most trusted men around him, including Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; and Aymer de Valence, soon to be Earl of Pembroke. Edward entrusted the magnates with the care of his son, and instructed them particularly to prevent the return of Piers Gaveston from exile. Nevertheless, when the King died on 7 July, one of Edward II's first acts as king was to recall his friend. Gaveston returned almost immediately, and the two were reunited by early August.|$|E
5|$|Norodom Sihanouk was {{the only}} child born of the union between Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak. His parents, who heeded the royal court astrologer's advice that he risked <b>dying</b> <b>at</b> a young age if he was raised under parental care, placed him {{under the care of}} Kossamak's grandmother, Pat. When Pat died, Kossamak brought Sihanouk to live with his {{paternal}} grandfather, Norodom Sutharot. Sutharot delegated parenting responsibilities to his daughter, Norodom Ket Kanyamom. Sihanouk received his primary education at the Francois Baudoin school and Nuon Moniram school in Phnom Penh. During this time, he received financial support from his maternal grandfather, Sisowath Monivong, to head an amateur performance troupe and soccer team. In 1936 Sihanouk was sent to Saigon, where he pursued his secondary education at Lycée Chasseloup Laubat, a boarding school.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them <b>dying.</b> <b>At</b> each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E
