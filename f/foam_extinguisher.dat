2500|$|The {{chemical}} <b>foam</b> <b>extinguisher</b> {{was invented}} in 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish a pan of burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the inner container (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of aluminium sulphate. When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer mechanical foam types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a screw-down stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a shut-off nozzle. Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} foam was {{a mixture}} of two powders and water produced in a foam generator. It was called chemical foam because of the chemical action to create it. In general, the powders used were sodium bicarbonate and aluminium sulfate, with small amounts of saponin or liquorice added to stabilise the bubbles. Hand-held <b>foam</b> <b>extinguishers</b> used the same two chemicals in solution. To actuate the extinguisher, a seal was broken and the unit inverted, allowing the liquids to mix and react. Chemical foam is a stable solution of small bubbles containing carbon dioxide with lower density than oil or water, and exhibits persistence for covering flat surfaces. Because it is lighter than the burning liquid, it flows freely over the liquid surface and extinguishes the fire by a smothering (removal/prevention of oxygen) action. Chemical foam is considered obsolete today because of the many containers of powder required, even for small fires.|$|R

Changes in emergency breathing equipment make Fine Water Mist operationally preferable. Supplied oxygen breathing systems allow for safe discharge of a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, without concerns of the crew inhaling unsafe levels of carbon dioxide. But the Portable Breathing Apparatus offers no more than 15 minutes of capability, and continued use of hose based supplied oxygen systems increases the oxygen content in a fire situation. NASA has developed a filtering respirator cartridge for use in a fire environment. It is qualified to provide up to 90 minutes of capability, and because it is a filtering respirator it does not add oxygen to the environment. The fire response respirator cartridge does not filter carbon dioxide, so a crew member discharging a CO 2 fire extinguisher while wearing this filtering respirator would be at risk of inhaling unsafe levels of CO 2. Fine Water Mist extinguishes a fire without creating a large volume of air with reduced oxygen and elevated CO 2. Compared to the carbon dioxide based Portable Fire Extinguisher, the flight qualification of Fine Water Mist systems requires special care. Qualification of the CO 2 based Portable Fire Extinguisher began with the assumption that any fire on ISS would be extinguished if the air in the fire environment reached a critical concentration of CO 2. Qualification of a CO 2 based system requires the developers to make assertions and assumptions about vehicle geometry and the ability of the extinguisher to deliver CO 2 in different geometric configurations, but the developers did not need to make assertions or assumptions {{about the size of the}} fire, the temperature, or the heat generation rate.

In addition, the NASA ISS specific fire standards will be described which were developed to establish acceptable extinguisher performance. The paper will also discuss the flight hardware design. The fin e water mist fire extinguisher has two major elements: (1) the nozzle and crew interface, and (2) the tank. The nozzle and crew interface have been under development for several years.

The crew and vehicle interface aspects of the design will use the heritage of the CO 2 based Portable Fire Extinguisher, to minimize the disruption to the crew and integration impacts to the ISS. The microgravity use environment of the system poses a set of unique design requirements specifically for the tank. The nozzle requirements drive a tank pressure that is 2 - 5 times higher than any commercially available water mist systems. Microgravity requires deliberate separation of gas and water, facilitated by a bladder, a diaphragm, a piston, or separate tanks.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of fire extinguishers: stored-{{pressure}} and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself. Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used. With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and <b>foam</b> <b>extinguishers</b> typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers {{are the most common}} type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent. This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated) models.

AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades little work has been {{conducted}} on the environmental behaviour and effects of perfluorinated organochemicals (FOCs).

The fact that PFOS is hardly biodegradable, clearly accumulates in the liver and blood of top predators and the fact that little information is available on the toxic properties of PFOS, makes this chemical an environmental pollutant of primary concern. In the present study we measured PFOS concentrations in seven marine mammals stranded on the Belgian, French and Dutch North Sea coast between 1994 and 2000. PFOS concentrations were measured in liver and kidney tissue using combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Detectable PFOS concentrations (up to 820. 60 ng/g) were found in harbour porpoises, white-beaked, white-sided and striped dolphins, sperm whales and harbour seals. In fin whale and hooded seal concentrations were below the detection limit of 10 ng/g. PFOS levels in female porpoise livers were significant higher than those in males. The present results show clearly the difference in accumulation pattern of PFOS compared to that of persistent organochlorine chemicals. In order to evaluate the interspecies differences, we developed PFOS-trophic level relationships based on stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. Animals that display the highest trophic positions (highest d 15 N) have the highest PFOS levels. The different feeding ecology of these species (inshore versus offshore) also seems to contribute to differences in PFOS concentrations. Next to the presentation of PFOS concentrations in marine mammals of the North Sea, the possible toxicological effects of perfluorinated compounds are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
