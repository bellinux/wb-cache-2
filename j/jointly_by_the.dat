5|$|As {{compensation}} for removing {{the track and}} field sections, the stadium company {{had to pay for}} a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK170,000 it cost to move Grand's club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered <b>jointly</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt's sponsors, Nordland Entreprenør.|$|E

After Napoleon's defeat and exile in 1814, the Southern Netherlands were occupied <b>jointly</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Austrians, Prussians and Dutch. In an attempt to strengthen their position in Belgium, the Austrians began to recruit a Belgian Legion of infantry, cavalry and artillery, which was merged with the Dutch army. The Hundred Days' Campaign, launched by Napoleon after his escape from exile, was largely fought in Belgium in early 1815, and Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo occurred just miles from Brussels.|$|E

5|$|During his studies, Wheeler had {{developed}} {{his love of}} archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established <b>jointly</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled {{the amount of money}} that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.|$|E
5|$|From 1 August 1872, the Middle Circle service {{also began}} {{operations}} through South Kensington, running from Moorgate along the MR's tracks {{on the north}} side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House.

In 1907, the station was given its present name, Westminster.|$|E
