5000|$|... (Jun. 12, 2001 Tasmania: Land of the Devils)Off the {{southeast}} coast of Australia is the island refuge of Tasmania. Safe from {{the forces that}} have changed much of the Australian continent, Tasmania is an Eden of magnificent forests, snow-capped mountain ranges, giant waterfalls, wild rivers and pristine coastlines. Tasmania is also {{the home of the}} largest marsupial carnivore - the Tasmanian Devil. Voracious eaters with powerful jaws, they often leave behind only the jawbone of their prey.

2500|$|Only {{the monk}} parakeet and five species of lovebirds build nests in trees, and three Australian and New Zealand <b>ground</b> <b>parrots</b> nest on the <b>ground.</b> All other <b>parrots</b> and {{cockatoos}} nest in cavities, either tree hollows or cavities dug into cliffs, banks, or the ground. The use of holes in cliffs {{is more common}} in the Americas. Many species use termite nests, possibly to reduce the conspicuousness of the nesting site or to create a favourable microclimate. In most cases, both parents participate in the nest excavation. The length of the burrow varies with species, but is usually between [...] in length. The nests of cockatoos are often lined with sticks, wood chips, and other plant material. In the larger species of parrots and cockatoos, the availability of nesting hollows may be limited, leading to intense competition for them both within the species and between species, as well as with other bird families. The intensity of this competition can limit breeding success in some cases. Hollows created artificially by arborists have proven successful in boosting breeding rates in these areas. Some species are colonial, with the burrowing parrot nesting in colonies up to 70,000 strong. Coloniality is not as common in parrots as might be expected, possibly because most species adopt old cavities rather than excavate their own.|$|R

The western <b>ground</b> <b>parrot</b> was subsequently considered a subspecies of the eastern <b>ground</b> <b>parrot</b> by Gregory Mathews in 1912.

Furthermore, it also confirms that investigations of soil CO 2 during fires are valuable in their own right quite aside from fire-induced transport mechanisms.

50|$|The blue-winged parrot (Neophema chrysostoma), {{also known}} as the blue-banded parakeet or blue-banded grass-parakeet, is a small parrot found in Tasmania and {{southeast}} mainland Australia. It is partly migratory, with populations of blue-winged parrots travelling to Tasmania for the summer. The parrot is sexually dimorphic - the males have more blue on the wings and a two-toned blue frontal band on the head, while females are duller and have more green on the wings and a wingbar. Both sexes have predominantly olive-green plumage. Predominantly a feeder on the <b>ground,</b> the blue-winged <b>parrot</b> mainly eats seeds of grasses. It adapts readily to captivity.|$|R

50|$|An Igbo fable {{concerning}} the tortoise {{and the birds}} has gained wide distribution because it occurs in the famous novel Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. The tortoise, who is a West African trickster figure, hears of a feast to be given by the sky-dwellers to the birds and persuades them to take him with them, winged in their feathers. There he tells the hosts that his name is 'All-of-you' and, when they provide the food with the assurance that 'This is for all of you', claims the entire feast. The enraged birds claim their feathers back and leave. Only the parrot will agree to take {{a message to the}} tortoise's wife to pull the bedding from his house and leave it on the <b>ground.</b> Instead the <b>parrot</b> tells her to bring out all the hard things so that when the tortoise jumps down its shell is broken. He survives, however, and the broken shell is glued together. This provides the explanation of why the tortoise's shell is so uneven. Much the same story is now claimed by the Swazi people and the Kikuyu.|$|R
