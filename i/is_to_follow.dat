5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} {{does not seem}} to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E

5|$|White Plume Mountain {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The module is a dungeon crawl, precipitated by the theft of three magical, sentient weapons: a trident named Wave, a war hammer named Whelm, and a sword named Blackrazor (all three were introduced in this adventure). The weapons' former owners each received a copy of a taunting poem, instructing them that the weapons are located in White Plume Mountain. The poem is signed by the wizard Keraptis, who thirteen hundred years ago descended into the volcanic mountain with a company of gnomes and disappeared. The player characters goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the same path and retrieve the weapons from Keraptis' lair.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

25|$|From Keswick, or as a labour saving {{alternative}} {{from the}} Gale Road car park behind Latrigg, {{a number of}} routes present themselves. Flag Pots can be reached from the tourist route to Skiddaw, or a direct line can be taken up the southern slopes. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> {{the southern edge of}} Lonscale Crags, and the final (and longest) option is to contour right around the fell up the Glenderaterra and outflank it from behind.|$|E

25|$|The last {{section of}} Paston way is between Overstrand and Cromer. The route follows the {{coastline}} here although an alternative <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the coast road. This {{part of the}} coastline is reputed to be the stalking ground of Legendary hellhound Black Shuck. And so on to Cromer and the Parish Church of St Peter and Saint Paul. The tower {{of the church is}} 160ft high and is well worth a visit and also marks the end of Paston Way. The path links with the North Norfolk Coastal Path/Peddars Way and the UK National Trails Network.|$|E
25|$|Pavey Ark is {{most often}} climbed from the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel, located some 1Â¼ miles (2 kilometres) to the south. The route follows Mill Gill up to Stickle Tarn, which can also be reached via a much less popular and more strenuous path {{following}} the Dungeon Ghyll ravines. From Stickle Tarn there is a choice of routes; {{one of the most}} popular <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> a diagonal slit on Pavey Ark's craggy south-eastern face. This route is known as Jack's Rake, and requires scrambling. Alternative, easier, ascents are available on either side of the main crag.|$|E
25|$|Using Figure 3 and {{knowledge}} of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values {{on either side of the}} gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a hydraulic jump forms to raise the water surface to the normal depth.|$|E

It then crossed overland to Clarks Run at the headwaters of Tulpehocken Creek, following Tulpehocken Creek downstream to Reading on the Schuylkill River. It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the Schuylkill downriver to the Delaware River at Philadelphia.|$|R

25|$|In practice, {{different}} Jewish communities observe different {{periods of}} mourning. Some families {{listen to music}} {{during the week of}} Passover and then commence the period of mourning until Lag BaOmer. Some Sephardic Jewish families begin the period of mourning from {{the first day of the}} Hebrew month of Iyar and continue for thirty-three days until the third of Sivan. The custom among Jerusalemites (minhag Yerushalmi) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the mourning practices during the entire Counting of the Omer, save for the day of Lag BaOmer and the last three days of the counting (sheloshet yemei hagbalah) prior to the onset of Shavuot. The extent of mourning is also based heavily on family custom, and therefore Jews will mourn to different degrees.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, {{the story}} of Max Havelaar, a Dutch colonial administrator, is told by two {{diametrically}} opposed characters: the hypocritical coffee merchant Droogstoppel, who intends to use Havelaar's manuscripts {{to write about the}} coffee trade, and the romantic German apprentice Stern, who takes over when Droogstoppel loses interest in the story. The opening chapter of the book nicely sets the tone of the satirical nature of what <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> with Droogstoppel articulating his pompous and mercenary world-view at length. At {{the very end of the}} novel Multatuli himself takes the pen and the book culminates in a vocal denunciation of Dutch colonial policies and a plea to the king of the Netherlands to intervene on behalf of his Indonesian subjects.|$|E
25|$|One general {{characteristic}} of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail {{is the way}} in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account of what it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> a rule. Indeed, he argues that any course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular form of life in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.|$|E
