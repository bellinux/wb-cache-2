50|$|The steady {{electric}} discharging {{currents in}} a lightning channel cause {{a series of}} incoherent impulses in the whole frequency range, the amplitudes of which decreases approximately with the inverse frequency. In the ELF-range, technical noise from 50 or 60 Hz, natural noise from the magnetosphere, etc. dominates. In the VLF-range, there are the coherent impulses from R- and K-strokes, appearing out of the background noise. Beyond about 100 kHz, the noise amplitude {{becomes more and more}} incoherent. In addition, technical noise from electric motors, ignition systems of motor cars, etc., are superimposed. Finally, beyond the high frequency band (3-30 MHz) <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>noise</b> (noise of galactic origin, solar noise) dominates.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{radio noise}} in {{telecommunication}} {{systems can be}} accounted for by the contribution which it makes to antenna noise temperature. Attenuation due to water vapor and oxygen, clouds, and precipitation is accompanied by thermal noise which further degrades the applicable signal-to-noise ratio. <b>Extraterrestrial</b> <b>noise</b> may be of thermal or nonthermal origin and may cover a continuum of frequencies or occur at discrete frequencies. The spectral index n (the exponent giving the variation of noise power density with wavelength) is - 2 for a black body and between 0 and - 2 for thermal emission in general. The mechanism responsible for much of the extensive nonthermal <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>noise</b> is synchrotron radiation, characterized by a positive spectral index...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the meteoroid flux is still a scientifically challenging task. This paper focusses {{on the impact of}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>noise</b> sources as well as atmospheric phenomena on the observation of specular meteor echoes. The effect of cosmic radio noise on the meteor detection process is estimated by computing the relative difference between radio loud and radio quiet areas and comparing the monthly averaged meteor flux for fixed signal-to-noise ratios or fixed electron line density measurements. Related to the cosmic radio noise is the influence of D-layer absorption or interference with sporadic E-layers, which can lead to apparent day-to-day variation of the meteor flux of 15 – 20 %...|$|E

40|$|Studies of <b>extraterrestrial</b> radio <b>noise</b> became {{world wide}} after WWII, and were rapidly {{separated}} {{into a number}} of disciplines. Solar radio astronomy, at a wavelength of 10. 7 cm, was initiated in 1946 at the Radio Field Station of the National Research Council. Its development at the Goth Hill Radio Observatory outside Ottawa is outlined until 1962, when the work was transferred to the Algonquin Radio Observatory.

40|$|The Earth’s {{magnetic}} field {{works like a}} shield against the solar wind flux of plasma, but at the polar regions, where it fails to do so, these charged particles may be guided down to low altitudes and introduce a lot of impacts on the environment, ranging from the nice colourful Aurora, to chemical changes in the atmosphere and decrease {{in the amount of}} ozone in the middle atmosphere, and from satellite damages to power line cut offs, depending on the type and energy of the particles. <b>Extraterrestrial</b> HF/VHF radio <b>noise</b> from the universe and mainly from our own galaxy is continuously coming towards our planet. Absorption of these electromagnetic waves in the Earth’s ionosphere is a well known proxy of the events which can enhance it, mainly having direct or indirect root in the solar activities, like Solar Flares, Coronal Mass Ejections, and Geomagnetic Storms and the resulted X rays, Solar Proton Events and Precipitating Energetic charged Particles. Cosmic radio noise power and the corresponding ionospheric absorption is normally measured by the riometers (Relative Ionospheric Opacity Meters for Extraterrestrial Electromagnetic Radiation), and especially in recent years by multiple narrow beam imaging riometers. In this thesis, the data obtained by the vertical beam of a narrow beam MST radar, ALWIN, at Andenes, Norway (69. 17 °N; 16. 01 °E) is used as a (narrow beam of a) riometer to estimate the incident cosmic noise power at 53. 5 MHz and its absorption, especially during solar/geomagnetic activity periods. The results are in good agreement with riometers (IRIS and AIRIS in Andenes and Kilpisjarvi Finland, 69. 06 °N, 20. 55 °E) common volume measurements and with electron density measurements of the Saura MF Radar. The obtained Quiet Day Curves (QDCs) are in very good agreement with theoretical and observed QDCs estimated by Friedrich et al. (2001) ...|$|R
