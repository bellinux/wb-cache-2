Here, we have employed DNA fiber labeling to quantify, for the first time, {{the extent to which}} Chk 1 maintains global replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> during normal vertebrate S phase. We report that replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in Chk 1 −/− chicken DT 40 cells are on average half of those observed with wild-type cells. Similar results were observed if Chk 1 was inhibited or depleted in wild-type DT 40 cells or HeLa cells by incubation with Chk 1 inhibitor or small interfering RNA. In addition, reduced rates of fork extension were observed with permeabilized Chk 1 −/− cells in vitro. The requirement for Chk 1 for high <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> during normal S phase was not to suppress promiscuous homologous recombination at replication forks, because inhibition of Chk 1 similarly slowed fork progression in XRCC 3 −/− DT 40 cells. Rather, we observed an increased number of replication fibers in Chk 1 −/− cells in which the nascent strand is single-stranded, supporting the idea that slow global <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in unperturbed Chk 1 −/− cells are associated with the accumulation of aberrant replication fork structures...|$|E
40|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) employs specialised DNA polymerases {{to bypass}} replication fork stalling lesions. PrimPol was recently {{identified as a}} TLS primase and polymerase involved in DNA damage tolerance. Here, we identify a novel PrimPol binding partner, PolDIP 2, and describe how it regulates PrimPol’s enzymatic activities. PolDIP 2 stimulates the polymerase activity of PrimPol, enhancing both its capacity to bind DNA and the processivity of the catalytic domain. In addition, PolDIP 2 stimulates both the efficiency and error-free bypass of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 - dihydrodeoxyguanosine (8 -oxoG) lesions by PrimPol. We show that PolDIP 2 binds to PrimPol’s catalytic domain and identify potential binding sites. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of PolDIP 2 in human cells causes a decrease in replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates,</b> similar to that observed in PrimPol-/- cells. However, depletion of PolDIP 2 in PrimPol-/- cells does not produce a further decrease in replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates.</b> Together, these findings establish that PolDIP 2 can regulate the TLS polymerase and primer extension activities of PrimPol, further {{enhancing our understanding of}} the roles of PolDIP 2 and PrimPol in eukaryotic DNA damage tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian genomes are {{replicated}} under {{a flexible}} program, with random use of origins and variable <b>fork</b> <b>rates,</b> and many {{details of the}} process must be still unraveled. Molecular combing provides a set of direct data regarding the replication profile of eukaryotic cells: fork rates; organization of the replication clusters; proportion of unidirectional forks; and fork dynamics. In this study the replication profiles of different primary and immortalized non-cancer human cells (lymphocytes, lymphoblastoid cells, fibroblasts) were evaluated at the whole-genome level or within reference genomic regions harboring coding genes. It emerged that these different cell types are characterized by specific replication profiles. In primary fibroblasts, a remarkable fraction of the mammalian genome {{was found to be}} replicated by unidirectional forks, and interestingly, the proportion of unidirectional forks further increased in the replicating genome along the population divisions. A second difference concerned in the proportion of paused replication forks, again more frequent in primary fibroblasts than in PBL/lymphoblastoid cells. We concluded that these patterns, whose relevance could escape when genomic methods are applied, represent normal replication features. In single-locus analyses, unidirectional and paused replication forks were highly represented in all genomic regions considered with respect to the average estimates referring to the whole-genome. In addition, <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly lower than whole-genome estimates. Instead, when considering the specificities of each genomic region investigated (early to late replication, normal or fragile site) no further differentiating features of replication profiles were detected. These data, representing the integration of genome-wide and single-locus analyses, highlight a large heterogeneity of replication profiles among cell types and within the genome, which should be considered for the correct use of replication datasets...|$|E

This concept combines the temperature robustness of multi-DOF sense modes with the common mode rejection capabilities of tuning fork architectures. The device consists of an anti-phase actuated 2 -DOF drive mode where each drive mass contains a 2 -DOF sense mode, thus forming an overall 6 -DOF mechanical system. The flat gain region of the 2 -DOF sense mode provides immunity to both environmental variations and fabrication imperfections, while the anti-phase forcing of the drive mode induces an anti-phase Coriolis response allowing for the cancellation of common mode inputs such as ambient vibrations.

40|$|PrimPol is a primase–polymerase {{involved}} in nu-clear and mitochondrial DNA replication in eukary-otic cells. Although PrimPol {{is predicted to}} possess an archaeo-eukaryotic primase and a UL 52 -like zinc finger domain, the role of these domains has not been established. Here, we report that the proposed zinc finger domain of human PrimPol binds zinc ions and is essential for maintaining primase activity. Al-though apparently dispensable for its polymerase ac-tivity, the zinc finger also regulates the processivity and fidelity of PrimPol’s extension activities. When the zinc finger is disrupted, PrimPol becomes more promutagenic, has an altered translesion synthesis spectrum and is capable of faithfully bypassing cy-clobutane pyrimidine dimer photolesions. PrimPol’s polymerase domain binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA, whilst the zinc finger domain binds only to single-stranded DNA. We additionally report that although PrimPol’s primase activity is required to restore wild-type replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in irradi-ated PrimPol−/ − cells, polymerase activity is suffi-cient to maintain regular replisome progression in unperturbed cells. Together, these findings provide the first analysis of the molecular architecture of PrimPol, describing the activities associated with, and interplay between, its functional domains and defining the requirement for its primase and poly-merase activities during nuclear DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|PrimPol is a primase-polymerase {{found in}} humans, and other eukaryotes, {{involved}} in bypassing lesions encountered during DNA replication. PrimPol employs both translesion synthesis and repriming mechanisms to facilitate lesion bypass by the replisome. PrimPol {{has been reported}} to be a potential susceptibility gene associated with the development of myopia. Mutation of tyrosine 89 to aspartic acid (PrimPolY 89 D) has been identified in a number of cases of high myopia, implicating it in the aetiology of this disorder. Here, we examined whether this mutation resulted in any changes in the molecular and cellular activities associated with human PrimPol. We show that PrimPolY 89 D has a striking decrease in primase and polymerase activities. The hydrophobic ring of tyrosine is important for retaining wild-type extension activity. We also demonstrate that the decreased activity of PrimPolY 89 D is associated with reduced affinities for DNA and nucleotides, resulting in diminished catalytic efficiency. Although the structure and stability of PrimPolY 89 D is altered, its fidelity remains unchanged. This mutation also reduces cell viability after DNA damage and significantly slows replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in vivo. Together, these findings establish that the major DNA replication defect associated with this PrimPol mutant is likely to contribute to the onset of high myopia...|$|E
40|$|Cellular and {{biochemical}} studies {{support a}} role for all five human RecQ helicases in DNA replication; however, their specific functions during this process are unclear. Here we investigate the in vivo association of the five human RecQ helicases with three well-characterized human replication origins. We show that only RECQ 1 (also called RECQL or RECQL 1) and RECQ 4 (also called RECQL 4) associate with replication origins in a cell cycle-regulated fashion in unperturbed cells. RECQ 4 is recruited to origins at late G 1, after ORC and MCM complex assembly, while RECQ 1 and additional RECQ 4 are loaded at origins {{at the onset of}} S phase, when licensed origins begin firing. Both proteins are lost from origins after DNA replication initiation, indicating either disassembly or tracking with the newly formed replisome. Nascent-origin DNA synthesis and the frequency of origin firing are reduced after RECQ 1 depletion and, to a greater extent, after RECQ 4 depletion. Depletion of RECQ 1, though not that of RECQ 4, also suppresses replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in otherwise unperturbed cells. These results indicate that RECQ 1 and RECQ 4 are integral components of the human replication complex and play distinct roles in DNA replication initiation and replication fork progression in vivo...|$|E

We have now used DNA combing to investigate initiation and further progression of DNA replication forks in this human in vitro system at single molecule level. We obtained direct evidence for bidirectional initiation of divergently moving replication forks in vitro. We assessed quantitatively replication fork initiation patterns, <b>fork</b> movement <b>rates</b> and overall <b>fork</b> density. Individual replication forks progress at highly heterogeneous rates (304 ± 162 bp/min) {{and the two}} forks emanating from a single origin progress independently from each other. <b>Fork</b> progression <b>rates</b> also change at the single fork level, suggesting that replication fork stalling occurs.

40|$|Invariance of {{temporal}} order of genome replication in eukaryotic cells and its correlation with gene activity has been well-documented. However, recent data suggest a relax control of replication timing. To evaluate replication schedule accuracy, we detailed the replicational {{organization of the}} developmentally regulated php locus that we previously found to be lately replicated, even though php gene is highly transcribed in naturally synchronous plasmodia of Physarum. Unexpectedly, bi-dimensional agarose gel electrophoreses of DNA samples prepared at specific time points of S phase showed that replication of the locus actually begins {{at the onset of}} S phase but it proceeds through the first half of S phase, so that complete replication of php-containing DNA fragments occurs in late S phase. Origin mapping located replication initiation upstream php coding region. This proximity and rapid fork progression through the coding region result in an early replication of php gene. We demonstrated that afterwards an unusually low <b>fork</b> <b>rate</b> and unidirectional <b>fork</b> pausing prolong complete replication of php locus, and we excluded random replication timing. Importantly, we evidenced that the origin linked to php gene in plasmodium is not fired in amoebae when php expression dramatically reduced, further illustrating replication-transcription coupling in Physarum...|$|R
40|$|Unwinding duplex DNA is a {{critical}} processing step during replication, repair and transcription. Pif 1 are highly conserved non-processive 5 ′-> 3 ′ DNA helicases with well-established roles in maintenance of yeast genome stability. However, {{the function of the}} sole member of Pif 1 family in humans remains unclear. Human PIF 1 is essential for tumour cell viability, particularly during replication stress, but is dispensable in non-cancerous cells and Pif 1 deficient mice. Here we report that suppression of PIF 1 function slows replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> and increases arrested forks during normal cycling conditions. Importantly, PIF 1 -dependent replication impediments impair S-phase progression and reduce proliferation rates of RAS oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, where replication fork slowing is exacerbated, but not parental, non-cancerous cells. Disrupted fork movement upon PIF 1 -depletion does not enhance double-stranded break formation or DNA damage responses but affects resumption of DNA synthesis after prolonged replication inhibitor exposure, accompanied by diminished new origin firing and mainly S-phase entry. Taken together, we characterised a functional role for human PIF 1 in DNA replication that becomes important for cell growth under oncogenic stress. Given that oncogenes induce high levels of replication stress during the early stages of tumorigenesis, this function of PIF 1 could become critical during cancer development...|$|E
40|$|The S phase-specific adaptor protein Claspin mediates the {{checkpoint}} response to replication stress by facilitating phosphorylation of Chk 1 by ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad 3 -related (ATR). Evidence {{suggests that these}} components of the ATR pathway also {{play a critical role}} during physiological S phase. Chk 1 is required for high rates of global replication fork progression, and Claspin interacts with the replication machinery and might therefore monitor normal DNA replication. Here, we have used DNA fiber labeling to investigate, for the first time, whether human Claspin is required for high rates of replication fork progression during normal S phase. We report that Claspin-depleted HeLa and HCT 116 cells display levels of replication fork slowing similar to those observed in Chk 1 -depleted cells. This was also true in primary human 1 BR 3 fibroblasts, albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting that Claspin is a universal requirement for high replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in human cells. Interestingly, Claspin-depleted cells retained significant levels of Chk 1 phosphorylation at both Ser 317 and Ser 345, raising the possibility that Claspin function during normal fork progression may extend beyond facilitating phosphorylation of either individual residue. Consistent with this possibility, depletion of Chk 1 and Claspin together doubled the percentage of very slow forks, compared with depletion of either protein alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{replication of}} the mammalian genome {{is a complex}} and logistically challenging process. The entirety of the genome must undergo a single duplication with as little error as possible. This must occur in a coordinated fashion and over suitably short time scale so as to allow timely cellular division within a cell cycle that is typically around 24 hours in a human cell. A great wealth of knowledge already exists describing {{various aspects of the}} S phase, during which this replication of the genome occurs. This data has been gathered over a variety of model systems, ranging from inferences from the replicative mechanics of SV 40 through to direct observations of replication in mammalian cells. In order integrate this data and determine the value of inferences from different data sources, quantitative models of the mammalian cell S phase are required. This study documents the development of several such models and the exploration of the influences that experimentally determined parameters and different mechanistic theories can have on the behaviour of a simulated S phase. Of particular exploratory interest were the modes of activating replication of replicon clusters, with the aim of simulating experimentally observed dynamics. Additionally, the study also aimed to investigate the variation of replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> and the density of origins of replication, along with the relationship that occurs between the two during both replicational stress and during a normal S phase. Through an iterative series of models, relevant parameters and key theories are sequentially explored so as to better understand the S phase. Particularly influential parameters were identified and studied in detail, with experimental determination where necessary in order to more accurately inform the model system. Conclusions concerning the behaviour of the system and the potential impact of the results were drawn upon the completion of each level of modelling and experimental work. To conclude the study, a linear model simulating the genome of the MRC 5 cell line was used to estimate the modes activation of DNA replication along chromosomes in order to recreate experimentally observed replication dynamics. Experimentally determined profiles of replication <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> and the density of origin firing were also determined for the MRC 5 cell line, and were used to populate the model with accurate and appropriate data. Using the model to simulate S phase through a variety of behavioural parameters, realistic S phase dynamics were found to occur through a combination of de novo activation of replicon clusters and a specific probability of neighbour activation by completed clusters. These derived mechanics, when performed on a system correctly parameterised with suitable data, can simulate experimentally observed phenomena. The development of the model highlighted the requirements of data fit for purpose, and the study also stresses the need for critical consideration of inferences made between different model systems.

40|$|Replication {{origins in}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae are spaced at {{intervals}} of approximately 40 kb. However, both measurements of replication <b>fork</b> <b>rate</b> and studies of hypomorphic alleles of genes encoding replication initiation proteins suggest {{the question of}} whether replication origins are more closely spaced than should be required. We approached this question by systematically deleting replicators from chromosome III. The first significant increase in loss rate detected for the 315 -kb full-length chromosome occurred only after all five efficient chromosomal replicators in the left two-thirds of the chromosome (ARS 305, ARS 306, ARS 307, ARS 309, and ARS 310) had been deleted. The removal of the inefficient replicator ARS 308 from this originless region caused little or no additional increase in loss rate. Chromosome fragmentations that removed the normally inactive replicators on the left end of the chromosome or the replicators distal to ARS 310 on the right arm showed that both groups of replicators contribute significantly to the maintenance of the originless chromosome. Surprisingly, a 142 -kb derivative of chromosome III, lacking all sequences that function as autonomously replicating sequence elements in plasmids, replicated and segregated properly 97 % of the time.

40|$|In eukaryotes, DNA {{replication}} is initiated along each chromosome {{at multiple}} sites called replication origins. Locally, each replication origin is "licensed", or specified, {{at the end}} of the M and the beginning of G 1 phases of the cell cycle. During S phase when DNA synthesis takes place, origins are activated in stages corresponding to early and late replicating domains. The staged and progressive activation of replication origins reflects the need to maintain a strict balance between the number of active replication <b>forks</b> and the <b>rate</b> at which DNA synthesis procedes. This suggests that origin densities (frequency of intiation) and replication <b>fork</b> movement (<b>rates</b> of elongation) must be co-regulated in order to guarantee the efficient and complete duplication of each subchromosomal domain. Emerging evidence supports this proposal and suggests that the ATM/ATR intra-S phase checkpoint plays an important role in the co-regulation of initiation frequencies and rates of elongation. In the following, we review recent results concerning the mechanisms governing the global regulation of DNA replication and discuss the roles these mechanisms play in maintaining genome stability during both a normal and perturbed S phase.

40|$|In {{response}} to DNA damage during S phase, cells slow DNA replication. This slowing is orchestrated by the intra-S checkpoint and involves inhibition of origin firing and reduction of replication fork speed. Slowing of replication allows for tolerance of DNA damage and suppresses genomic instability. Although {{the mechanisms of}} origin inhibition by the intra-S checkpoint are understood, major questions remain about how the checkpoint regulates replication forks: Does the checkpoint regulate the rate of fork progression? Does the checkpoint affect all forks, or only those encountering damage? Does the checkpoint facilitate the replication of polymerase-blocking lesions? To address these questions, we have analyzed the checkpoint in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a single-molecule DNA combing assay, which allows us to unambiguously separate the contribution of origin and fork regulation towards replication slowing, and allows us to investigate the behavior of individual forks. Moreover, we have interrogated the role of forks interacting with individual sites of damage by using three damaging agents-MMS, 4 NQO and bleomycin-that cause similar levels of replication slowing with very different frequency of DNA lesions. We find that the checkpoint slows replication by inhibiting origin firing, but not by decreasing <b>fork</b> <b>rates.</b> However, the checkpoint appears to facilitate replication of damaged templates, allowing forks to more quickly pass lesions. Finally, using a novel analytic approach, we rigorously identify fork stalling events in our combing data and show that they play a previously unappreciated role in shaping replication kinetics in {{response to}} DNA damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{replication}} dynamics at common {{fragile site}} FRA 6 E has been evaluated by molecular combing and interphase fluorescent {{in situ hybridisation}} (FISH) in primary human lymphocytes cultured under normal or aphidicolin-induced stress conditions. FRA 6 E {{is one of the}} most frequently expressed common fragile sites of the human genome. It harbours several genes, PARK 2 being regarded as the most relevant one. According to the results obtained from interphase FISH analysis, FRA 6 E can be considered a mid-late-replicating sequence characterised by heterogeneous replication timing. Molecular combing did not reveal specific replication parameters at the fragile site: <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> were highly comparable to those detected at an early replicating locus (LMNB 2) used as control and in very good agreement with the whole-genome data obtained in parallel. The same indication applied to the density of initiation zones, the inter-origin distances from adjacent ongoing forks, the frequencies of unidirectional forks, fork arrest events and asynchronous forks. Interestingly, PARK 2 appeared embedded in an early/late replication transition zone, corresponding to intron 8 (162 kb) and to the fragility core of FRA 6 E. In cells exposed to aphidicolin, few forks progressing at a rather slow rate were observed, the majority of them being unidirectional, but again a specific response of the fragile site was not observed. In summary, at FRA 6 E the replication process is not impaired per se, but chromosome breakages occur preferentially at an early/late replication transition zone. Aphidicolin might increase the occurrence of breakage events at FRA 6 E by prolonging the time interval separating the replication of early and late replication domains. These results may be of general significance to address the problem of fragile site instability...|$|E
40|$|Chromatography on benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose {{has been}} used to {{fractionate}} fully double-stranded from partially single-stranded DNA molecules. DNA was extracted from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from patients with megaloblastic anemia resulting from vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency after pulse-labeling the cells with [3 H]thymidine for 5 min and chasing in unlabeled medium for 24 h. No gross accumulation of partially single-stranded material was observed in the DNA of these cells when compared with DNA from similarly labeled control cells obtained by the addition of 5 -formyl tetrahydrofolic acid to the culture medium. When DNA from lymphocytes labeled with a 5 -min pulse of [3 H]thymidine and sheared to fragments of an average length of 18 micrometer was chromatographed on benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose, approximately 80 % of the label was recovered in the partially single-stranded fraction. After chasing in unlabeled medium the label was progressively transferred to the double-stranded fraction over a period of 2 [...] 3 h. The rate of transfer was slower in megaloblastic lymphocytes than in controls. The difference in rate suggested a slower rate of replication fork movement in megaloblastic lymphocytes and so the density shift technique of Painter and schaeffer (J. Mol. Biol. 45 : 467 [...] 479, 1969) was used to measure the fork rate directly. [3 H]Deoxycytidine was used as the labeled nucleoside to avoid possible complications arising from [3 H]thymidine labeling of megaloblastic cells. Investigations on the lymphocytes from four patients showed that the replication fork rate in vitamin-treated control lyphocytes was about 1 micrometer/min. The <b>fork</b> <b>rates</b> in the corresponding untreated cells were invariably lower and rates ranging from 40 to 92 % of those of controls were observed. Normal lymphocytes treated with the deoxynucleotide pool-depleting drugs methotrexate or hydroxyurea displayed defects in DNA synthesis similar to those of untreated megaloblastic lymphocytes.

The specific pattern of BRG 1 occupancy suggests it does not participate in origin selection but is involved in the firing of origins and the process of replication elongation. This latter function is confirmed by the fact that Brg 1 mutant mouse embryos and RNAi knockdown cells exhibit a 50 % reduction in replication <b>fork</b> progression <b>rates,</b> which is associated with decreased cell proliferation.

Mouse cells disrupted for the RTEL 1 -PCNA interaction (PIP mutant) exhibited accelerated senescence, replication fork instability, reduced replication <b>fork</b> extension <b>rates,</b> and increased origin usage.

Chromosome replication initiates in the daughter stalked cell but is repressed in the daughter swarmer cell until later in the cell cycle. To study cell-type-specific DNA initiation, chromosome replication was directly analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Analysis of Dra I restriction fragments of DNA taken at various times from synchronized cell cultures labeled with 2 '-deoxy[3 H]guanosine has allowed us to determine the origin of DNA replication, the rate and direction of fork movement, and the order of gene replication. The first labeled Dra I fragment to appear contains the site of replication initiation. Based on the correlation of the physical and genetic maps derived by Ely and Gerardot [Ely, B. & Gerardot, C.

40|$|During S phase, {{the entire}} genome must be {{precisely}} duplicated, with no sections of DNA left unreplicated. Here, we develop a simple mathemat-ical model {{to describe the}} probability of replication failing due to the irreversible stalling of replication forks. We show that the probability of complete genome replication is maximized if replication origins are evenly spaced, the largest inter-origin distances are minimized, and the end-most origins are positioned close to chromosome ends. We show that origin positions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome conform to all three predictions thereby maximizing the probability of complete replication if replication forks stall. Origin positions in four other yeasts—Kluyveromyces lactis, Lachancea kluyveri, Lachancea waltii and Schizosaccharomyces pombe—also conform to these predictions. Equating failure rates at chromo-some ends with those in chromosome interiors gives a mean per nucleotide <b>fork</b> stall <b>rate</b> of 5108, {{which is consistent with}} experimental estimates. Using this value in our theoretical predic-tions gives replication failure rates that are consist-ent with data from replication origin knockout experiments. Our theory also predicts that signifi-cantly larger genomes, such as those of mammals, will experience a much greater probability of repli-cation failure genome-wide, and therefore will likely require additional compensatory mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{replication}} in eukaryotes {{is considered}} to proceed according to a precise program in which each chromosomal region is duplicated in a defined temporal order. However, recent studies reveal an intrinsic temporal disorder in the replication of yeast chromosome VI. Here we provide {{a model of the}} chromosomal duplication to study the temporal sequence of origin activation in budding yeast. The model comprises four parameters that influence the DNA replication system: the lengths of the chromosomes, the explicit chromosomal positions for all replication origins as well as their distinct initiation times and the replication <b>fork</b> migration <b>rate.</b> The designed model is able to reproduce the available experimental data in form of replication profiles. The dynamics of DNA replication was monitored during simulations of wild type and randomly perturbed replication conditions. Severe loss of origin function showed only little influence on the replication dynamics, so systematic deletions of origins (or loss of efficiency) were simulated to provide predictions to be tested experimentally. The simulations provide new insights into the complex system of DNA replication, showing that the system is robust to perturbation, and giving hints about the influence of a possible disordered firing...|$|R
40|$|Replication protein A (RPA) is a {{single-stranded}} DNA binding protein, {{involved in}} most aspects of eukaryotic DNA metabolism. Here, we study the behavior of RPA on a DNA substrate that mimics a replication fork. Using magnetic tweezers we show that both yeast and human RPA can open forked DNA when sufficient external tension is applied. In contrast, at low force, RPA becomes rapidly displaced by the rehybridization of the DNA fork. This process appears to be governed by the binding or the release of an RPA microdomain (toehold) of only few base-pairs length. This gives rise to an extremely rapid exchange dynamics of RPA at the <b>fork.</b> <b>Fork</b> rezipping <b>rates</b> reach up to hundreds of base-pairs per second, being orders of magnitude faster than RPA dissociation from ssDNA alone. Additionally, we show that RPA undergoes diffusive motion on ssDNA, such {{that it can be}} pushed over long distances by a rezipping fork. Generally the behavior of both human and yeast RPA homologs is very similar. However, in contrast to yeast RPA, the dissociation of human RPA from ssDNA is greatly reduced at low Mg(2 +) concentrations, such that human RPA can melt DNA in absence of force...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} such as DNA combing {{have led to the}} availability of large quanti-ties of data that describe the state of DNA while undergoing replication in S phase. In this chapter, we describe methods used to extract various parameters of replica-tion — fork velocity, origin initiation <b>rate,</b> <b>fork</b> density, numbers of potential and utilized origins — from such data. We first present a version of the technique that applies to “ideal ” data. We then show how to deal with a number of real-world complications, such as the asynchrony of starting times of a population of cells, the finite length of fragments used in the analysis, and the finite amount of DNA in a chromosome. Key words: DNA replication, replication fork velocity, origin initiation...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} the strength of the acti-vation of the intra-S DNA damage checkpoint varies within the S phase. Synchronized diploid human fibroblasts were exposed to either 0 or 2. 5 J m 2 UVC in early, mid- and late-S phase. The endpoints measured were the following: (1) radio-resistant DNA synthesis (RDS), (2) induction of Chk 1 phosphorylation, (3) initiation of new replicons and (4) length of replication tracks synthesized after irradiation. RDS analy-sis showed that global DNA synthesis was inhibited by approximately the same extent (30 12 %), regardless of when during S phase the fibroblasts were exposed to UVC. Western blot analysis revealed that the UVC-induced phos-phorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1) on serine 345 was high in early and mid S but 10 -fold lower in late S. DNA fiber immunostaining studies indicated that the replication <b>fork</b> displacement <b>rate</b> decreased in irradiated cells at the three time points examined; however, replicon initiation was inhibited strongly in early and mid S, but this response was attenuated in late S. These results suggest that the intra-S checkpoint activated by UVC-induced DNA damage is not as robust toward the end of S phase in its inhibition of the latest firing origins in human fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the process of}} asymmetric division during sporulation of Bacillus subtilis, we have measured changes in cell cycle parameters during the transition from vegetative growth to sporulation. Because the propensity of B. subtilis to grow in chains of cells precludes the use of automated cell-scanning devices, we have developed a fluorescence microscopic method for analyzing cell cycle parameters in individual cells. From the results obtained, and measurements of DNA replication <b>fork</b> elongation <b>rates</b> and the escape time of sporulation from the inhibition of DNA replication, we have derived a detailed time scale for the early morphological events of sporulation which is mainly consistent with the cell cycle changes expected following nutritional downshift. The previously postulated sensitive stage in the DNA replication cycle, beyond which the cell is unable to sporulate without a new cell cycle, could represent {{a point in the}} division cycle at which the starved cell cannot avoid attaining the initiation mass for DNA replication and thus embarking on another round of the cell cycle. The final cell cycle event, formation of the asymmetric spore septum, occurs at about the time in the cell cycle at which the uninduced cell would have divided centrally, in keeping with the view that spore septation is a modified version of vegetative division...|$|R

40|$|DNA damage slows DNA {{synthesis}} at replication forks; {{however, the}} mechanisms remain unclear. Cdc 7 kinase {{is required for}} replication origin activation, is a target of the intra-S checkpoint, and is implicated in the response to replication fork stress. Remarkably, we found that replication forks proceed more rapidly in cells lacking Cdc 7 function than in wild-type cells. We traced this effect to reduced origin firing, which results in fewer replication forks and a consequent decrease in Rad 53 checkpoint signaling. Depletion of Orc 1, which acts in origin firing differently than Cdc 7, had similar effects as Cdc 7 depletion, consistent with decreased origin firing being the source of these defects. In contrast, mec 1 - 100 cells, which initiate excess origins and also are deficient in checkpoint activation, showed slower fork progression, suggesting the number of active <b>forks</b> influences their <b>rate,</b> perhaps {{as a result of}} competition for limiting factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of Beta, the single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP) of bacteriophage λ in Escherichia coli promotes {{high levels of}} oligonucleotide (oligo) -mediated mutagenesis and offers {{a quick way to}} create single or multiple base pair insertions, deletions, or substitutions in the bacterial chromosome. High rates of mutagenesis can be obtained by the use of mismatch repair (MMR) -resistant mismatches or MMR-deficient hosts, which allow for the isolation of unselected mutations. It has recently become clear that many bacteria can be mutagenized with oligos {{in the absence of any}} SSAP expression, albeit at a much lower frequency. Studies have shown that inactivation or inhibition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) exonucleases in vivo increases the rate of SSAP-independent oligo-mediated mutagenesis. These results suggest that λ Beta, in addition to its role in annealing the oligo to ssDNA regions of the replication <b>fork,</b> promotes high <b>rates</b> of oligo-mediated mutagenesis by protecting the oligo from destruction by host ssDNA exonucleases...|$|R
