50|$|Most of {{the shells}} {{used by the}} sIG 33 were unexceptional in design, but the Stielgranate 42 was {{different}} in fundamental ways from ordinary shells. The <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> was loaded into the muzzle so that the finned projectile remained in front of, and outside, the barrel entirely. A special charge was loaded and would propel the projectile about 1000 m. At about 150 m distance, the <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> would separate from the projectile. Unlike other Stielgranaten, this version was not intended for anti-tank use, but rather for the demolition of strongpoints and clearing barbed-wire obstacles and minefields by blast effect.|$|E
50|$|An {{estimate}} for the tractive effort {{of a single}} cylinder steam locomotive {{can be obtained from}} the cylinder pressure, cylinder area, stroke of the piston and the diameter of the wheel. The torque developed by the linear motion of the piston depends on the angle that the <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> makes with the tangent of the radius on the driving wheel. For a more useful value an average value over the rotation of the wheel is used. The driving force is the torque divided by the wheel radius.|$|E

50|$|The {{enthusiasm of}} crews {{for the new}} {{locomotive}} was at first muted. The boiler was very effective at evaporation (there was already evidence of a combustion chamber at {{the front end of}} the firebox), however against that there were numerous teething troubles, e.g. the <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> bearings were too small. This led continually to overheating. The loosely coupled Prussian box tender led to disturbing riding qualities when running tender-first. Its riding performance was never fully satisfactory. As a result of poor weight compensation, the top speed estimated by Garbe was never achieved and it was eventually assessed at 100 km/h (60 mph).|$|E
5000|$|One leading idle (non-driven) axle {{mounted in}} a bogie, four driven axles {{mounted in the}} frame and {{connected}} by <b>driving</b> <b>rods</b> or gears, followed one trailing idle axle mounted in a bogie (Whyte notation: 2-8-2).|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} are of outside-frame design, {{with the}} driving wheels placed {{between the two}} chassis frames which support the boiler, but with the cylinders, <b>driving</b> <b>rods,</b> counterweights and valve gear on the outside.

A centrifugal governor, which moderates the level of steam provided if the engine begins to overload was added some years after this, and beam and main <b>driving</b> <b>rod,</b> both originally of wood, were replaced in sand-cast iron.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s the US {{military}} {{was looking for}} an upgrade to the M1919 that could feed from either side for use as an improved coaxial machine gun. Saco-Lowell developed a model that had the driving spring attached to the back plate (eliminating {{the need for a}} mainspring and <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> protruding out the back of the bolt), a solenoid trigger for remote firing, a feed cover that could open from either side, a bolt with dual tracks that could feed from either side, and a reversible belt feed pawl, ejector, and feed chute. The experimental T151 had a flat backplate (?), the T152 had spade grips and a [...] "butterfly" [...] trigger like the M2HB, and the T153 had a pistol grip and back-up trigger like the M1919A4 and an extended charging handle similar to those on the M1919A5. The T153 was adopted as the M37 and was produced by SACO-Lowell and Rock Island Arsenal from 1955 to 1957. It was in regular service from 1955 until it was replaced by the M37E1 in the late 1960s and the M73A1 in the early 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{it became}} clear {{additional}} motive power was required in the North Island, but the process of dieselisation was yet to begin. Consequently, NZR chose to order 16 steam locomotives from North British {{to the design of}} the successful J class. These locomotives contained a number of differences to both the J class and Hillside JAs - although turned out with the cross-compound pump, roller bearings on the rods were limited to the connection between the connecting and <b>driving</b> <b>rod,</b> mechanical lubrication was employed. In January 1951 the order had been made for the 16 JA to be more coal burners, and North British regarded the order as essentially a repeat order, virtually identical to 1939 J, but in April 1951 the NZR CME requested the order to be changed to oil burning due to perceived long term coal shortage due to the waterfront strike and the associated strike by miners and unavailability of shipping for coal and the expected long term high imported coal price and the long time it would take to build up coal stocks to safe levels, and the class were built as oil burners, with no grate, ash pan or fire door (the only class of locomotives on the NZR to be built completely as oil burners)and ACFL blow down was incorporated late in their construction. A significant improvement was the incorporation of French T.I.A, blow down equipment which enabled rapid ejection of boiler sludge and reduced the boiler scale, enabling much faster turnaround and higher availability. The system of injection of the oil flow into the burners is different and far more effective than in NZR 1948-50 conversion of 12 Js to oil burning. Other detail differences was the use of Stone's headlights and electrical generator instead of the usual Pyle National equipment, the [...] "Butterfly" [...] number boards on the front headlight, and the lack of smokebox number plate (although a smokebox plate was specified by the NZR).|$|E
5000|$|The K {{represents}} the nickname [...] "Mikado" [...] that describes a locomotive with two non-powered, pivoting wheels {{in front of}} eight driving wheels, which are connected to <b>driving</b> <b>rods</b> powered by the engine's pistons, and finally two non-powered trailer wheels located under the cab. The name {{comes from the fact}} that the first significant use of the type was a series built by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Japanese Railways in 1887.|$|R
50|$|The {{trailing}} truck allows a larger, deeper firebox {{than that of}} a 2-10-0. Like all ten-coupled designs, the long rigid wheelbase of the coupled wheels presented a problem on curves, requiring flangeless drivers, lateral motion devices and much sideplay on the outer axles. To limit this problem, the coupled wheels were generally small, up to 64 in in diameter, which in turn generated the problem of insufficient counterweights to balance the weight of the <b>driving</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{develop the}} {{components}} for the Eco2001, ABB Henschel used two Class 120 prototype locomotives, 120 004 and 005, {{which had been}} converted by ABB in 1992, {{in order to test}} new technologies in service. 120 005 received new electric power converters based on GTO-Thyristors, as well as new on-board electronics. 120 004 additionally received flexi-float bogies adapted from ICE units with <b>driving</b> <b>rods</b> instead of pivot pins, disc brakes, and utilising a new biodegradable polyol-ester cooling agent for its main transformer. Both of these reconfigured locomotives covered large distances in regular IC service without disruption.|$|R
40|$|Piezo-Stepper {{actuators}} {{also called}} as piezowalk actuators find widespread application in precision mechatronic systems. This is {{primarily because of}} their high accuracy, long range of motion and compact volume. One such application is in the optical column manipulator of a lithography system. During operation, whenever a motion is desired beyond the analog range of the actuator, a stepping motion is performed. A major performance limiting factor here is that during stepping, large disturbances and vibrations are induced in the manipulator due to hammering action of the clamp piezolegs. To reduce these errors, it is desired to regulate the interaction behaviour of the constitutive piezolegs of the actuator with the <b>driving</b> <b>rod.</b> In this research, the self sensing property of the piezoelectric element is exploited to detect contact and liftoff. Secondly, a self-sensing observer is designed to obtain force and position feedback signals to the controller. Finally using these signals as feedback, a modified impedance control scheme is designed to regulate the internal interaction behaviour between the piezolegs and the <b>driving</b> <b>rod.</b> Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringPrecision & Microsystems Engineering (PME...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDriving {{energy was}} {{measured}} in a standard penetration test (SPT) and 12 types of dynamic cone penetration tests (DCPTs) having different configurations for the hammer, <b>driving</b> <b>rod,</b> anvil and cone tip. The driving energy transferred from the free falling hammer to the <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> was estimated from the measurements of strain and acceleration below the anvil. Basically, the driving energy was estimated for 21 successive blows {{in order to obtain}} the mean value, the standard deviation (σ) and the coefficient of variance (COV) in the SPT and DCPTs. The dynamic cone resistance, qdyn, was estimated from the driving energy, the corresponding set per blow, and masses of the hammer and the total rods. Thus, the estimated dynamic cone resistance was compared with the static cone resistance, qt, from a cone penetration test (CPT). The main objective of this report is to provide information on the driving efficiency in the SPT and each DCPT. The mean values for ef in the tests ranged from 52 % to 76 %. The values of COV for ef ranged from 0. 024 to 0. 265. Even though the test results are limited, the dynamic cone resistance, qt, estimated from the dynamic measurements were relatively good measures of the cone resistance from the CPT, showing the importance of the dynamic measurement in the SPT and DCPTs. In addition, possible factors influencing the driving efficiency, such as the hammer mass, the configuration of the <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> (solid or hollow), the ratio of the diameter of the anvil and the diameter of the hammer, and the existence of a cushion or cushions between the anvil and the hammer, are discussed {{on the basis of the}} limited test results...|$|E
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{electromagnetic}} transducer {{for the middle}} ear implants (MEIs) have been developed {{as an alternative to}} conventional hearing aids for the rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss. Electromagnetic transducer type and design are thought to have a significant influence on their hearing compensation performance. To investigate these effects, a middle ear computational model was constructed based on a complete set of microcomputerized tomography section images of a human ear. Its validity was confirmed by comparing the model predicted motions with published experimental measurements. The result shows that the eardrum driving transducer (EDT) is superior to the floating mass transducer (FMT) in hearing compensation when the transducer mass is small but inferior to the FMT when the mass gets bigger. The incus body driving transducer (IBDT) is the most ineffective type of transducer for hearing compensation. Moreover, the masses of the EDT and the FMT decrease the transducer performance mainly at higher frequencies: the greater the transducer mass, the lower the displacement of the stapes excited by these transducers. On the other hand, the IBDT <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> stiffness decreases transducer's performance severely at low frequencies and its adverse effect on transducer performance increases with the decrease of the stiffness of the IBDT <b>driving</b> <b>rod...</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1834, {{the engine}} was {{selected}} for further (unsuccessful) modifications to test a newly developed rotary steam engine designed by Lord Dundonald. At a cost of nearly £80, Rockets cylinders and <b>driving</b> <b>rods</b> were removed {{and two of the}} engines were installed directly on its driving axle with a feedwater pump in between. On 22 October, of that year, an operational trial was held with disappointing results; one witness observing, that [...] "the engine could not be made to draw a train of empty carriages". Due to inherent design flaws and engineering difficulties associated with their design, Dundonald's engines were simply too feeble for the task.|$|R

50|$|This {{new design}} {{departed}} from the previous approach of building electric locomotives with a slow running, large motor and went for four smaller electric motors. The drive was {{divided into two groups}} within a single frame. Each group had two motors, that drove a common countershaft using cogs. The countershaft drove a jackshaft via inclined <b>driving</b> <b>rods</b> which was coupled to two driving axles with coupling rods. In order to ensure that the permitted axle load was not exceeded the engines were given a leading and trailing bogie. The locomotive body with its two driver's cabs was built on the frame. The vehicle components were manufactured by Maffei and the electrical equipment by WASSEG, a joint venture of AEG and SSW.|$|R
40|$|A life-size {{mechanical}} {{middle ear}} model and human temporal bones {{were used to}} evaluate three different middle ear transducers for implantable hearing aids: the <b>driving</b> <b>rod</b> transducer (DRT), the floating mass transducer (FMT) or vibrant sound bridge, and the contactless transducer (CLT). Results of the experiments with the mechanical model were {{within the range of}} the results for human temporal bones. However, results with the mechanical model showed better reproducibility. The handling of the mechanical model was considerably simpler and less time-consuming. Systematic variations of mounting parameters showed that the angle of the rod has virtually no effect on the output of the DRT, the mass loading on the cable of the FMT has a larger impact on the output than does the tightness of crimping, and the output level of the CLT can be increased by 10 dB by optimizing the mounting parameters...|$|E
30|$|Numerous penetrometers are in {{practice}} worldwide for investigation and characterization of subgrade. There are many developments in geotechnical instrumentation which are noticed in both the penetrometers, but more {{have been made}} on the dutch cone penetrometer (DCPT). CPT has also got many improvements, which increases its capability to handle diverse ground conditions [4], accurately identifying soil types [3, 23, 29], and gives better estimates of relevant geotechnical soil parameters.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties of the snowpack is necessary for avalanche prediction, hydrology, and climate change studies. A penetrometer is being developed that will drive a pressure sensor on a 3 -meter rod into the snow for high resolution point measurements {{at a rate of}} 5 kHz. In addition to the sensor and <b>driving</b> <b>rod,</b> the device contains an embedded system that allows the user to control the drive motor, retrieve and store data from the sensor to a micro SD card, and interface retrieve time and position information from a GPS. This embedded system is enclosed in a watertight box for protection while still allowing for user interaction. The current version of the penetrometer’s embedded system cannot reliably control and record data from the motor and sensor. This embedded system is being redesigned and rebuilt with an emphasis on reliability, to ensure that the penetrometer can be used effectively. The new design will be a microcontroller-based solution developed on the widely available Arduino platform, equipped with an LCD screen to display system status and menu options. Initially the penetrometer will be a stand-alone device meant to be operated by hand; however, future uses may call for it to remain stationed in remote areas to take measurements from onboard the Geosciences Greenland Rover robot...|$|E

5000|$|VMH 1-4 was {{a series}} of {{locomotives}} built by Hohenzollern, with serial numbers 2835 to 2838, for the Stoomtramweg-Maatschappij Venlo - Maasbree - Helden (VMH) in 1911. They entered service in 1912, named VENLO, PANNINGEN, HELDEN and MAASBREE. A condenser with four pipes of diameter 152 mm and a length of 3150 mm was part of the locomotive equipment. [...] It was removed at a later date. At the absorption of the VMH into the Limburgsche Tramweg Maatschappij (LTM) in 1923 the locomotives were numbered 13-16. The MBS purchased all former VMH lines and equipment of the LTM in 1929. These locomotive retained their numbers at that time. The name plate of VMH 1 VENLO was placed on VMH 5 (LTM 17). In 1935 the passenger service on the line Venlo-Beringen was terminated and the locomotives were taken out of service. Locomotives 13, 15 and 16 were sold for scrap in 1937. Locomotive 14 remained, without axles, wheels and <b>driving</b> <b>rods</b> in the workshops of the MBS in Gennep. [...] It was used as heating boiler.
