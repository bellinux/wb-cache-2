25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E

The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The anthropic {{principle}} was discussed by Leonard Susskind {{as well as}} Carlo Rovelli, who mentions it in his essay. [...] The {{anthropic principle}} claims that the universe <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> because {{if it was not}} specifically like how we see it, we would not be here to describe it. Leonard Susskind expands by talking about the idea that the anthropic principle {{can be seen as a}} threat to the mentality that every law governing the cosmos is set in stone; thus being unalterable.|$|E

As soon as the glass is melted to the proper consistency, the furnaces are opened, and the pots are lifted into the air by machinery, and passed along a beam to an immense table of cast iron. A signal is given, and the brilliant, transparent liquid glass falls out and spreads over the table. At a second signal a roller is passed by machinery over the red-hot glass, and twenty men stand ready with long shovels to push the sheet of glass into an oven, not very hot, where it can slowly cool. When {{taken out of the}} oven the glass is thick, and not perfectly smooth, {{and it has to be}} rubbed with sand, imbedded in plaster of Paris, smoothed with emery, and polished by rubbing it with a woollen cloth covered with red oxide of iron, all of which is done by machinery.|$|E

60|$|This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> done. The canoes form in line, {{one hundred}} to two hundred feet apart. In {{the bow of}} each canoe a man wields a stone, several pounds in weight, which is {{attached}} to a short rope. He merely smites the water with the stone, pulls up the stone, and smites again. He goes on smiting. In the stern of each canoe another man paddles, driving the canoe ahead {{and at the same time}} keeping it in the formation. The line of canoes advances to meet a second line a mile or two away, the ends of the lines hurrying together to form a circle, the far edge of which is the shore. The circle begins to contract upon the shore, where the women, standing in a long row out into the sea, form a fence of legs, which serves to break any rushes of the frantic fish. At the right moment when the circle is sufficiently small, a canoe dashes out from shore, dropping overboard a long screen of cocoanut leaves and encircling the circle, thus reinforcing the palisade of legs. Of course, the fishing is always done inside the reef in the lagoon.|$|E
