40|$|An {{improved}} linear sled {{has been}} developed to provide precise motion stimuli without generating perceptible extraneous motion cues (a noiseless environment). A modified adaptive forced-choice method was employed to determine perceptual thresholds to whole-body linear sinusoidal motion in 25 subjects. Thresholds {{for the detection of}} movement in the horizontal plane were found to be lower than those reported previously. At frequencies of 0. 2 to 0. 5 Hz, thresholds were shown to be independent of frequency, while at frequencies of 1. 0 to 3. 0 Hz, thresholds showed a decreasing sensitivity with increasing frequency, indicating that the perceptual process is not sensitive to the rate change of acceleration of the motion stimulus. The results suggest that the perception of motion behaves as an <b>integrating</b> <b>accelerometer</b> with a bandwidth of at least 3 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Space {{and time}} gait {{parameters}} {{can be estimated}} with wearable inertial units. Linear displacement information is typically obtained by double <b>integrating</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data over each gait cycle. However, usually a drift affects the resulting displacement signals and therefore its effects should be minimized. In the majority of studies using accelerometers, drift is corrected on the hypothesis that during the stance phase, the velocity of the sensor placed on the foot is zero. This assumption allows to set to zero the estimated velocity at both {{the beginning and the}} end of the gait cycle. Despite the use of the latter hypothesis is crucial for the drift correction, to the authors’ knowledge, no quantitative validation of this hypothesis is available in the literature. This study aimed at determining the velocity profiles of various points of the foot during the stance phase of the gait cycle while walking at different speeds...|$|E
40|$|Presentation date: 2006 - 06 - 13 Graduation date: 2007 Smart weapons {{promise to}} provide leap ahead {{capability}} {{with regard to}} accuracy and engagement range for medium and large caliber projectiles. One {{of the most critical}} components of a smart weapon system is its sensor suite that provides position, orientation, and velocity information as the projectile flies down range so that effective control action can be taken in flight. Great strides have been made in creating very small and rugged Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) using MEMS accelerometers and vibrating gyroscopes. However, all IMU systems operate by <b>integrating</b> <b>accelerometer</b> and gyroscope measurements. Thus, they must be initialized at launch to produce sufficiently accurate position and orientation data. Due to inherent uncertainty in shot-to-shot launch conditions, for gun launched projectiles, initial conditions cannot be adequately specified by the firing platform like it can with aircraft and missiles. Currently, there is no adequate method to initialize IMU sensor suites on gun launched munitions. This thesis investigates a novel concept for determining the full state of a projectile near the muzzle of the gun. The methodology relies on the gun system inducing a known spatially varying magnetic field {{in the vicinity of the}} muzzle of the gun. Using readings from a cluster of magnetometers embedded within the projectile, the full state of the projectile is determined by solving a nonlinear set of equations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the validity of an accelerometer to measure average acceleration values during high speed running. Thirteen subjects performed three sprint efforts over a 40 m distance (n = 39). Acceleration was measured using a 100 Hz tri-axial <b>accelerometer</b> <b>integrated</b> within a wearable tracking device (SPI-HPU, GPSports, Canberra). To provide a concurrent measure of acceleration, timing gates were positioned at 10 m intervals (0 m - 40 m). Accelerometer data collected during 0 m - 10 m and 10 m - 20 m provided a measure of average acceleration values. Accelerometer data was recorded as the raw output and filtered by applying a 3 point moving average and a 10 point moving average. The accelerometer could not measure average acceleration values during high speed running. The accelerometer significantly overestimated average acceleration values during both 0 m - 10 m and 10 m - 20 m, regardless of the data filtering technique (p < 0. 001). Body mass significantly affected all accelerometer variables (p < 0. 10, partial η = 0. 091 - 0. 219). Body mass and the absence of a gravity compensation formula affect the accuracy and practicality of <b>accelerometers.</b> Until GPSports <b>integrated</b> <b>accelerometers</b> incorporate a gravity compensation formula the usefulness of any accelerometer derived algorithms is questionable...|$|R
