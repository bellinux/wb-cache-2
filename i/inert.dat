40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out on coal dust-inertant mixture explosions. Tests of explosion severity and flammability limit were conducted by using the Siwek 20 L vessel and influences of ignition energy, coal dust calorific value, coal dust concentration and inertant composition were taken into account. The increase of <b>inerting</b> results with ignition energy is followed by an approximate stabilization when ignition energy exceeds 5 kJ. The ignition energy region of 5 - 10 kJ is appropriate for <b>inerting</b> testing, whereas ignitors with energy lower than 5 kJ produce unrealistic <b>inerting</b> results. The <b>inerting</b> effectiveness of inertant increases with the reduction of coal dust calorific value. Coal dust concentrations near the stoichiometric concentration require {{the greatest amount of}} inertant to suppress explosions. As the coal dust concentration increases beyond the stoichiometric, the amount of inertant requirement is reduced. Due to the efficient decomposition and particular flame extinguishing mechanism, monoammonium phosphate represents more excellent <b>inerting</b> effectiveness than calcium carbonate...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the <b>inerting</b> {{systems on}} {{military}} aircraft, this <b>inerting</b> system would run continuously to reduce fuel vapor flammability whenever the aircraft's engines are running; and its {{goal is to}} reduce oxygen content within the fuel tank to 12%, lower than normal atmospheric oxygen content of 21%, but {{higher than that of}} <b>inerted</b> military aircraft fuel tanks, which is a target of 9% oxygen. This is accomplished by ventilating fuel vapor laden ullage gas out of the tank and into the atmosphere.|$|R

5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of <b>inert</b> gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive.

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal <b>inert</b> gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an <b>inert</b> or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination.

5|$|Xenon is {{a member}} of the zero-valence {{elements}} that are called noble or <b>inert</b> gases. It is <b>inert</b> to most common chemical reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons.

5|$|A {{saturation}} {{profile is}} one {{which all the}} tissues considered by the decompression model have become saturated with <b>inert</b> gas from the breathing mixture. Most decompression models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered.

5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} <b>inert</b> gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for <b>inert</b> gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E

5000|$|The order affects {{aircraft}} whose {{air conditioning}} units have a possibility of heating up what {{can be considered a}} normally empty center wing fuel tank. Some Airbus A320 and Boeing 747 aircraft are slated for [...] "early action". Regarding new aircraft designs, the Airbus A380 does not have a center wing fuel tank and is therefore exempt, and the Boeing 787 has a fuel tank safety system that already complies with the proposed rule. The FAA has stated that there have been four fuel tank explosions in the previous 16 years—two on the ground, and two in the air—and that based on this statistic and on the FAA's estimate that one such explosion would happen every 60 million hours of flight time, about 9 such explosions will probably occur in the next 50 years. The <b>inerting</b> systems will probably prevent 8 of those 9 probable explosions, the FAA said.Before the <b>inerting</b> system rule was proposed, Boeing stated that it would install its own <b>inerting</b> system on airliners it manufactures beginning in 2005. Airbus had argued that its planes' electrical wiring made the <b>inerting</b> system an unnecessary expense.|$|R

5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an <b>inert</b> shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than <b>inert,</b> so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (<b>inert</b> gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten <b>inert</b> gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an <b>inert</b> shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or tungsten <b>inert</b> gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process {{that uses a}} nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an <b>inert</b> or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material.

5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the <b>inert</b> gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas.

This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
