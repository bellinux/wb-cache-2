More efficient methods to solve elastic and inelastic eigenvalue and eigenvectors {{have been developed}} to deal with stability problems in structures with arbitrary shape, irregular stiffness, loads and boundary conditions. The Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) with the facilities of elastic spring restraints, buckling under coupled loads, different load locations has been developed and programmed by the author. It has been applied to reveal the basic behaviour and the interaction between the modes of light <b>gauge</b> steel <b>members.</b> It has been found that the AISI design approach with elastic bucking stresses obtained using GBT can be used to correctly predict the strength of compression thin-walled columns.

40|$|Through cold-forming, thin <b>gauge</b> {{structural}} <b>members</b> {{and structural}} sheeting can be shaped. This structural sheeting and supporting structural members are joined together {{by means of}} self-drilling screw fasteners, resulting in a load-bearing system transmitting the surface loads to the main steel frame. Uplift (wind suction) and gravity (self-weight, snow, maintenance) loading in general generate both bending and torsion within the purlins. Since the roof sheeting and steel purlin are connected, this connection both provides lateral and rotational restraint. This positive effect is accounted for within a design. Several design rules are available and proposed {{for this type of}} complex systems. In most cases the amount of lateral restraint is very large. On the contrary, the rotational restraint is flexible. Recent Ph. D. studies [Katnam, 2007] propose a design rule as an extension for available rules within Eurocode 3, part 1. 3 (2003), based on detailed numerical analysis and validated by means of a set of well chosen experiments, so-called Pekoz-tests. In the framework of a collaborative research with an industrial partner, a large number of Pekoz tests were performed for different types of sheeting and Z- and -members. These tests provide a unique opportunity for external validation of the proposed design rules. Based on this extensive experimental validation, this contribution gives a critical appraisal of the proposed design rules to incorporate the rotational restraint within the combined steel purlin-sheeting system. status: publishe...|$|R

Research was conducted to address the knowledge gap associated with the amplification of second-order effects due to local instabilities, the treatment of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect of interactive buckling on light <b>gauge</b> steel <b>members.</b> The objectives of this research were achieved through a combination of numerical and experimental investigations using two different types of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The first series of experiments investigated the effects of interactive buckling through a number of compression tests on varying lengths of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The second experimental investigation was used to study the effects of local instabilities on the second-order effects and behaviour of light gauge steel frames. Fourteen full scale storage rack tests were completed using different combinations of beam depths and nominal horizontal loads. Measured imperfection data and calibrated FE models were then used to determine a rational procedure for implementing geometric imperfections into advanced analysis. Special attention was given to the effect that local instabilities had on the second-order displacements of the frame.

We place initial data for the linearized system along t = 1 ≃T^ 3 and study the linear solution's behavior in the collapsing direction t ↓ 0. Our main result is the identification of {{a new form of}} approximate L^ 2 monotonicity for the linear solutions that holds whenever the background Kasner solution is sufficiently close to the spatially isotropic Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solution. Using the approximate monotonicity, we derive sharp information about the asymptotic behavior of the linear solution as t ↓ 0. In particular, we show that some of its time-rescaled components converge to regular functions defined along t = 0. In addition, we motivate the preferred direction of the approximate monotonicity by showing that the CMC-transported spatial coordinates gauge can be realized as a limiting version of a family of parabolic gauges for the lapse variable in which the monotonicity is also visible. In the companion article "Stable Big Bang formation in near-FLRW solutions to the Einstein-scalar field and Einstein-stiff fluid systems," we use the strength of our linear stability results to prove a stable singularity formation result for the nonlinear equations.

40|$|Recent {{applications}} {{in the use of}} light <b>gauge</b> steel <b>members</b> have been concerned with developing large scale systems built entirely from cold-formed steel members. An explicit analysis of such structures is complicated by the different phenomena that the structure may be prone to during loading. In particular, elastic buckling phenomena is an important consideration in the design of such structures since the load at which buckling occurs often provides a close upper bound to the carrying capacity of the structure. The first part of this two-part thesis (Part I, Chaptersl- 8) has been devoted to general methods of analysis of the torsional-flexural buckling of thin-walled structures. A review of previous investigations and the available methods of solution is presented. A general finite element formulation of the torsional-flexural buckling of thin-walled structures has been derived. The resulting elastic geometric matrix can be used to analyse structures with monosymmetrical members. It also includes the effect of sectorial-monosymmetry for cross-sections without any axis of symmetry. A general transformation matrix has been developed to allow for the application of the finite element method to the three-dimensional elastic stability analysis of space and portal frames. The validity and accuracy of the new finite element formulation have been checked by analysing a number of different elastic lateral buckling problems for which exact or highly accurate solutions by other techniques are available. An experimental program was carried out on simply supported cold-formed steel z-beams. The first part of this program was undertaken to check the validity of the finite element calculations of the bimoments caused by nonuniform torsion. The second part was devoted to elastic lateral buckling of z-beams under combined bending and torsion. The second part of this thesis (Part II, Chapter 9) deals with the analysis of hipped roof structures with corrugated steel roof sheeting. A simple theoretical model has been suggested. The model has been used to perform an elastic linear analysis of the behaviour of two types of the hipped roof structures. The theoretical results are compared with previous experimental results for these two structures...|$|R

A total of thirty-three welded towers were tested in the investigation with all the towers in a horizontal position and concentrated load at mid-span. Two specimens were fixed with strain <b>gauges</b> on every <b>member,</b> while all other specimens were tested with strain gauges fixed on only one panel. After the test, tensile specimens were cut from the diagonals of the tower, and tested for the yield stress and tensile strength. Axial forces in the diagonal and leg members were calculated based on the actual yield stress and strain readings, assuming an elastic perfectly-plastic stress-strain curve for steel. The buckling loads were determined from the maximum axial forces in the tested members, and effective length factors were calculated according to CSA-S 37 - 94 Standard and AISC-LRFD Specifications. The average effective length based on CSA-S 37 - 94 for cross-braced diagonals is 0. 35 of the total diagonal length, while the effective length is 0. 37 of the total diagonal length based on AISC-LRFD.

40|$|In recent years, light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed steel <b>members</b> {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in low and mid- rise residential building construction. In cold-formed steel design there are several applications where built-up box girders are used to resist load induced in a structure when a single section {{is not sufficient to}} carry the design load. The cold-formed steel box girders may be subjected to eccentric loading when the web of one of the sections receives the load and transfers it through the connection to another section. There may be an unequal distribution of load in built-up girder assemblies loaded from one side. In the current North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (CSA-S 136 - 01, 2001), there is no guideline or design equation to calculate the flexural capacity of this type of section. AISI cold-formed steel framing design guide (2002) has recommended that the moment of resistance and inertia of the built-up section are the simple addition of the component parts, based on deflection compatibility of the two sections. However, this design approximation has not been justified by any experimental or numerical study. Very little information was found in literature about this topic. The objective of this study is the investigation of the flexural behaviour of built-up box girders assembled from cold-formed stud and track sections when subjected to eccentric loading. Finite element analysis is conducted for this purpose, being much more economical than expensive experimental testing. Detailed parametric studies are carried out to identify the factors affecting the flexural capacity of built-up cold-formed steel sections. The parametric results are used to develop a design equation for calculating the flexural capacity of built-up cold-formed steel sections...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2013. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Steven J. Wojtkiewicz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 158 pages. Many of the bridges in the United States {{are being used}} beyond their initial design intentions, classified as structurally deficient, and {{are in need of}} rehabilitation or replacement. A portion of these bridges suffer from specific bridge vulnerabilities that have been categorized as fracture prone. The safe operating life of fracture prone details is governed by the stress range experienced by the detail. Providing alternate load paths through a supplemental apparatus attached to the bridge structure can relieve high stress ranges, and the limited safe bridge service life due to these vulnerabilities may be safely extended. As part of the apparatus, the utility of a mechanical amplifier, the scissor jack, is carefully investigated; the amplifier allows for a very localized application and much smaller stiffness and damping device demands. The mathematical relationships for the apparatus, in particular the magnification factor for displacement and force, are formulated analytically and verified through numerical modeling. The effects of the mechanical amplifier are investigated on a simple beam numerical model as well as through more comprehensive parameter studies on numerical bridge models of an in-service fracture critical bridge. The parameter studies reveal that longer apparatuses and larger cross-sectional member area improve performance. A relatively small passive stiffness and damping device provides adequate safe life extension when employing the mechanical amplifier and vastly outperforms an apparatus without the amplifier. The apparatus parameters are optimized through a series of simulations, and small amounts of device damping with no stiffness perform the best. Much larger damping and stiffness coefficients are necessary to achieve similar performance without the mechanical amplifier. Safe life extension of over 100 percent can be achieved with apparatus member cross-sectional area of 25 percent of the bridge girder area. For implementation on a general bridge, a long and slender mechanically amplified RM apparatus is recommended for safe life extension. For a passive system, a RM device with a small damping coefficient and no stiffness should be employed. The cross-sectional area of the RM apparatus members will need to be sufficiently large to provide adequate safe life extension and will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A simple bridge model should be used to <b>gauge</b> initial <b>member</b> size. Frequency response analyses of the modified bridge structures show response amplification at some loading frequencies. Analyses also found different optimal device characteristics for decreasing the magnitude of the maximum or minimum moment range experienced at the vulnerability. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that semi-active control strategies allowing for changes in device characteristics may ultimately be more beneficial and should be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of fire safety design has been realised {{due to the}} ever increasing loss of properties and lives caused by structural failures during fires. In recognition of the {{importance of}} fire safety design, extensive research has been undertaken in the field of fire safety of buildings and structures especially {{over the last couple of}} decades. In the same period, the development of fire safety engineering principles has brought significant reduction to the cost of fire protection. However the past fire research on steel structures has been limited to heavier, hot-rolled structural steel members and thus the structural behaviour of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed steel <b>members</b> under fire conditions is not well understood. Since cold-formed steel structures have been commonly used for numerous applications and their use has increased rapidly in the last decade, the fire safety of cold-formed steel structural members has become an important issue. The current design standards for steel structures have simply included a list of reduction factors for the yield strength and elasticity modulus of hot-rolled steels without any detailed design procedures. It is not known whether these reduction factors are applicable to the commonly used thin, high strength steels in Australia. Further, the local buckling effects dominate the structural behaviour of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed steel <b>members.</b> Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. The first phase of this research program included 189 tensile coupon tests including three steel grades and six thicknesses to obtain the accurate yield strength and elasticity modulus values at elevated temperatures because the deterioration of the mechanical properties is the major parameter in the structural design under fire conditions. The results obtained from the tensile tests were used to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel members. An appropriate stress-strain model was also developed by considering the inelastic mechanical characteristics. The second phase of this research was based on a series of more than 120 laboratory experiments and corresponding numerical analyses on cold-formed steel compression members to investigate the local bucking behaviour of the unstiffened flange elements, stiffened web elements and stiffened web and flange elements at elevated temperatures up to 800 °C. The conventional effective design rules were first simply modified considering the reduced mechanical properties obtained from the tensile coupon tests and their adequacy was studied using the experimental and numerical results. It was found that the simply modified effective width design rules were adequate for low strength steel members and yet was not adequate for high strength cold-formed steel members due to the severe reduction of the ultimate strength in the post buckling strength range and the severe reduction ratio of the elasticity modulus to the yield strength at elevated temperatures. Due to the inadequacy of the current design rules, the theoretical, semi-empirical and empirical effective width design rules were developed to accurately predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling effects at elevated temperatures. The accuracy of these new design methods was verified by comparing their predictions with a variety of experimental and numerical results. This thesis presents the details of extensive experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this research program and the results including comparison with simply modified effective width design rules. It also describes the advanced finite element models of cold-formed steel compression members developed in this research including the appropriate mechanical properties, initial imperfections, residual stresses and other significant factors.

40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value.

40|$|In recent times, {{light gauge}} cold-formed steel {{sections}} {{have been used}} extensively in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural components. This is because cold-formed steel sections {{have a very high}} strength to weight ratio compared with thicker hot-rolled steel sections, and their manufacturing process is simple and cost-effective. However, these members are susceptible to various buckling modes including local and distortional buckling and their ultimate strength behaviour is governed by these buckling modes. Fire safety design of building structures has received greater attention in recent times due to continuing loss of properties and lives during fires. Hence, {{there is a need to}} fully evaluate the performance of light gauge cold-formed steel structures under fire conditions. Past fire research has focused heavily on heavier, hot-rolled steel members. The buckling behaviour of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed steel <b>members</b> under fire conditions is not well understood. The buckling effects associated with thin steels are significant and have to be taken into account in fire safety design. Therefore, a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. As the first phase of this research program more than 115 tensile coupon tests of light gauge cold-formed steels including two steel grades and five thicknesses were conducted at elevated temperatures. Accurate mechanical properties including the yield strength, elasticity modulus and stress-strain curves were all determined at elevated temperatures since the deterioration of the mechanical properties is one of the major parameters in the structural design under fire conditions. An appropriate stress-strain model was also developed by considering the inelastic characteristics. The results obtained from the tensile coupon tests were then used to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel compression members. In the second phase of this research more than 170 laboratory experiments were undertaken to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light gauge coldformed steel compression members at ambient and elevated temperatures. Two types of cross sections were selected with various thicknesses (nominal thicknesses are 0. 6, 0. 8, and 0. 95 mm) and both low and high strength steels (G 250 and G 550 steels with minimum yield strengths of 250 and 550 MPa). The experiments were conducted at six different temperatures in the range of 20 to 800 °C. A finite element model of the tested compression members was then developed and validated with the help of experimental results. The degradation of mechanical properties with increasing temperatures was included in finite element analyses. An extensive series of parametric analyses was undertaken using the validated finite element model to investigate the effect of all the influential parameters such as section geometry, steel thickness and grade, mechanical properties and temperature. The resulting large data base of ultimate loads of compression members subject to distortional buckling was then used to review the adequacy of the current design rules at ambient temperature. The current design rules were reasonably accurate in general, but in order to improve the accuracy further, this research has developed new design equations to determine the ultimate loads of compression members at ambient temperature. The developed equation was then simply modified by including the relevant mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. It was found that this simple modification based on reduced mechanical properties gave reasonable results, but not at higher temperatures. Therefore, they were further modified to obtain a more accurate design equation at elevated temperatures. The accuracy of new design rules was then verified by comparing their predictions with the results obtained from the parametric study. This thesis presents a description of the experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this research and the results including comparison with simply modified current design rules. It describes the laboratory experiments at ambient and elevated temperatures. It also describes the finite element models of cold-formed steel compression members developed in this research that included the appropriate mechanical properties, initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses. Finally, it presents the details of the new design equations proposed for the light gauge coldformed steel compression members subjected to distortional buckling effects at elevated temperatures...|$|R
