5|$|Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) {{wishes to}} conduct a further {{post-mortem}} on Laura's body, but it is due to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield and knocking him down. Later, Rosenfield shares what he has found; Laura had been bound when she was killed, had been addicted to cocaine, and had been clawed by a bird. An unidentified plastic shard was also found <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 138 melon seeds were found <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> {{intestines}} and esophagus. It is inferred that {{she died in}} summer, when fruits and melons ripen. The presence of food <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> also indicates that she died within {{two to three hours}} after eating the melon.|$|E
25|$|O'Rourke {{became ill}} in early 1987 and was misdiagnosed by doctors at Kaiser Permanente Hospital as having Crohn's disease. She was {{prescribed}} prednisone {{to treat the}} disease, which caused her cheeks to appear puffy and large. On January 31, 1988, O'Rourke suddenly became ill again, vomiting and unable to keep anything <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> The next morning, she collapsed while preparing {{to leave for the}} hospital and her stepfather called paramedics. O'Rourke suffered a cardiac arrest en route to the hospital, and after resuscitation, she was airlifted by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where she died later that day.|$|E
50|$|Taenia asiatica is also usually asymptomatic. The only {{severe case}} {{was in a}} 60-year-old woman at the Mackay Memorial Hospital <b>in</b> Taiwan. <b>Her</b> <b>stomach</b> and {{intestine}} were severely damaged with active bleeding from ulcers caused by a single tapeworm.|$|R

25|$|On September 16, Truscott's {{trial began}} in the then Supreme Court of Ontario in Goderich before Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury. Steven Truscott was {{represented}} by Frank Donnelly; Glen Hays appeared for the Crown. All the evidence presented in court against the accused was circumstantial, and centred on placing Harper's death within a narrow time frame which implicated Truscott. Key to this narrow window was the autopsy doctor's testimony that the decomposition of Lynne's body {{and the state of}} partially digested food <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> indicated she had died near the precise time she was acknowledged to have been with Truscott. On September 30, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. Mr. Justice Ferguson, then sentenced Truscott to death (to hang).|$|E
25|$|Oral sex alone cannot {{result in}} {{pregnancy}} and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of contraception. For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, {{there is no}} connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system, and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by acids <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> and proteins in the small intestine. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, {{there is a potential}} risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.|$|E
500|$|The female penguin returns at {{any time}} from {{hatching}} to ten days afterwards, from mid-July to early August. She finds her mate {{among the hundreds of}} fathers by his vocal call and takes over caring for the chick, feeding it by regurgitating the food that she has stored <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> The male then leaves to take his turn at sea, spending around 24days there before returning. [...] The parents then take turns, one brooding while the other forages at sea. If the incubating parent is not relieved by its partner before its own energy reserves are depleted, then it returns to the sea to re-feed, abandoning its doomed egg or chick at the colony site. Abandoned chicks do not survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident <b>in</b> which <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|R

500|$|Soon after midnight, Charlotte began {{vomiting}} violently {{and complaining}} of pains <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> [...] Sir Richard was called, and was alarmed {{to find his}} patient cold to the touch, breathing with difficulty, and bleeding. [...] He placed hot compresses on her, the accepted treatment at the time for postpartum bleeding, but the blood did not stop. [...] He called in Stockmar and urged him to bring Leopold. [...] Stockmar found Leopold difficult to rouse, and {{went to see the}} Princess, who grabbed his hand and told him, [...] "They have made me tipsy." [...] Stockmar left the room, planning to try again to rouse the Prince, but was called back by Charlotte's voice, [...] "Stocky! [...] Stocky!" [...] He entered the room to find her dead.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the world's media {{were quick to}} condemn Mansfield's stunts. One {{editorial}} columnist wrote, [...] "We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> to fill out her bikini better; but we get angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses...use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked". By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate {{a great deal of}} negative publicity because of repeated exposure of her breasts in carefully staged public [...] "accidents". Richard Blackwell, her wardrobe designer (who also designed for Jane Russell, Dorothy Lamour, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan), dropped her from his client list because of those accidents. In April 1967, Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "She confuses publicity and notoriety with stardom and celebrity and the result is very distasteful to the public." ...|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, the sheriff's body disappears, and Reyes doubles over in pain. Doggett and Harrison pull up {{her shirt}} to reveal moving bulges <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> as if {{something}} {{is trying to get}} out. Harrison then begins to bleed from her eyes. Doggett approaches Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. [...] Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but falls down into a blackened abyss, where he is attacked by the insects. [...] However, due to Doggett's skepticism, he is able to fight off the illusion. [...] Because he does not believe they are real, they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the [...] "sheriff" [...] who had no organs, and Reyes' and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{real name}} was Martadinata Haryono, however, she was better known by her nickname, Ita. At the age of 18 and while a senior year student <b>in</b> <b>her</b> high school, Ita was found dead on October 9, 1998 <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bedroom <b>in</b> Central Jakarta. <b>Her</b> <b>stomach,</b> chest, and right arm were stabbed ten times, while her neck was slashed. The murder {{occurred}} just three days after a Jakarta press conference held by the human rights organizations Ita had been involved with. The groups claimed that several of their members had received death threats {{in an attempt to}} stop them calling for an international investigation into the gang-rapes, murder, and burning of Indonesian Chinese girls and women during the May 1998 riot; a riot which ultimately forced Suharto to step down from the presidency.|$|R
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, when {{threatened}} the blotchy swellshark is capable of rapidly inflating its stomach with water or air. This allows the shark to wedge itself inside a rocky crevice, becoming extremely difficult to remove. This species is an opportunistic, highly voracious predator; one recorded female [...] long had 10 fish about [...] long and 15 squid about [...] long <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> Predominantly piscivorous, this species is known to prey upon hagfish and at least 50 species of bony fishes, including fast-swimming types that inhabit open water; significant prey species include the mackerel Scomber japonicus, the sardine Sardinops melanostictus, the filefish Thamnaconus modestus, and the hakeling Physiculus japonicus. Unusually for such a small shark, it also feeds on at least 10 species of cartilaginous fishes, including lantern sharks, catsharks (particularly the cloudy catshark, Scyliorhinus torazame, and its eggs), the electric ray Narke japonica, and skates (including their eggs). It also cannibalizes smaller members of its own species. Cephalopods, mostly the squid Doryteuthis bleekeri and the cuttlefish Sepia spp., are also frequently taken, while crabs, shrimp, and isopods are occasionally consumed. The dietary composition of juveniles varies notably from place to place.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately for Waddingham, the man {{in charge}} of cremations was Dr Cyril Banks, who was also the Medical Officer for Health in Nottingham. Banks had never thought highly of Waddingham's {{establishment}} as a so-called [...] "nursing home", and knew there was no State Registered Nurse on the staff (as there should have been). He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation and ordered a post-mortem. The post-mortem found no traces of anything connected to Ada's physical conditions that could have immediately caused death. This led to an analysis of the organs of the deceased by Dr W. W. Taylor, Senior Assistant to the Nottingham Analyst. He found considerable traces of morphine (over three grains) <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> liver, kidneys and her heart.|$|E
2500|$|A seventeen-year-old Prague art {{student named}} Karou leads an {{interesting}} life: she has blue hair that grows from her head, speaks {{a variety of}} languages, has three bullets <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> and has been raised by creatures with human and animal features called chimaera. These are Brimstone, with lion legs and ram horns; Issa, with a snake's lower body, hood, and fangs; Twiga, with a giraffe neck; and Yasri, with a parrot beak. Kishmish, a crow with bat wings, acts as a messenger from Brimstone to Karou. Karou is often sent on missions to gather teeth for Brimstone, although {{she does not know}} what they are used for and why there are certain rules such as [...] "no baby teeth" [...] and [...] "no rotting". In return she gets wishes; the higher the price, the greater the wish.|$|E
60|$|Another day {{she strolled}} into the store-room {{and saw a}} large tray of fresh buns {{standing}} there. Now, it was against the rule to eat between meals, and new hot bread or cake was especially forbidden. Patty remembered both these things, but could not resist temptation. One plump, brown bun, with a lovely plum right in the middle, was so fascinating {{it was impossible to}} let it alone; so Patty whipped it into her pocket, ran to the garden, and hiding behind the big lilac-bush, ate it in a great hurry. It was just out of the oven, and so hot it burned her throat, and lay like a live coal <b>in</b> <b>her</b> little <b>stomach</b> after it was down, making her very uncomfortable for several hours.|$|R

2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
