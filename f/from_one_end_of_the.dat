5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons {{that they can use}} as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
5|$|Races over short distances, or sprints, {{are among}} the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games {{featured}} only one event, the stadion race, which was a race <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route {{to ensure that there}} would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E

25|$|In a pennate muscle, as a {{consequence}} of their arrangement, fibers are shorter than they would be if they ran <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle to the other. This implies that each fiber is composed of a smaller number N of sarcomeres in series. Moreover, the larger is the pennation angle, the shorter are the fibers.|$|E

The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Victor Prus, {{the station}} is a normal side {{platform}} station, built by cut-and-cover {{in order to provide}} a large space for the heavily trafficked mezzanine. As {{a key part of the}} underground city, the mezzanine has ticket barriers on either side, in order to allow pedestrians to pass <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station to the other. Bridges over the tracks below the mezzanine level allow passengers to cross from one platform to the other.|$|E
25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} eyebars for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed {{access to the}} cable spinning mechanism and the main cable during construction. In several ways similar to a ski lift, additional superior cables carried {{one or more of}} these travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|E

25|$|Mérida {{has four}} large {{internal}} roadways, which run <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{city to the}} other, and five smaller roadways. The largest is {{the combination of the}} Andrés Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than , it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of Mérida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Américas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Próceres avenue.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inuit world to the other, and some people do not {{think of it as}} a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|Minehead {{signal box}} was closed on 27 March 1966 {{after which the}} two tracks between there and Dunster were {{operated}} as two bi-directional single lines, one to each platform. Dunster Signal Box was retained to control the level crossing and points there, and ground frames allowed the train crew to change the points at Minehead to allow locomotives to run round <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train to the other. The original turntable was removed from Minehead in 1967 by which time all trains were operated by diesels.|$|E

25|$|All tracklaying had {{to start}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, to ensure the rack was {{correctly}} aligned; so although the first locomotives were delivered in July 1895 very little track was laid until August, when the two large viaducts between Llanberis and Waterfall were completed. Progress up the mountain was then quite rapid, with the locomotives being used to move materials as required. Considering the exposed location and possible effects of bad weather, {{it is surprising that}} the first train reached the summit in January 1896. As the fencing and signals were not then ready, the opening was set for Easter.|$|E
25|$|Mérida {{has four}} {{principal}} rivers and some smaller seasonal streams {{in the less}} urbanized parts of the city, these last ones have a significant water flow only in times of heavy precipitation. The most important river is the Chama, followed by the Albarregas, which cross the plain and divide it into two parts: the Banda Occidental (west bank) and the Banda Oriental (east bank). These two rivers run <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city to the other. The other two principal rivers are the Mucujún and the Milla, which flow into the Chama and Albarregas. In {{the lower part of}} the city is found the La Rosa lake, one of some 200 lakes in Mérida State.|$|E
25|$|Three state {{highways}} {{enter the}} vicinity of East Rochester: the aforementioned NY 31F, better known locally as Fairport Road, New York State Route 153 (Washington Street), and unsigned New York State Route 940U (West Commercial Street). NY 153 has the highest average annual daily traffic of any street serving East Rochester proper, carrying 11,000 vehicles per day between NY 31F and Commercial and 18,000 vehicles daily from Commercial to Linden Avenue as of 2004. NY 31F carries over 27,000 vehicles per day but does not enter the village. NY 153 is also the only north-south street in the village that runs <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village {{to the other and}} continues into neighboring towns. Linden Avenue is the only east-west street accomplishing this feat.|$|E

25|$|Penn Manor's {{switch to}} a 4 x 4 block {{schedule}} coincided with the renovation project. Where a traditional schedule has students moving to eight classes a day, the block schedule has four 90-minute classes {{in the fall and}} four different classes in the spring. Considering the size of the building, eight minutes were needed between classes to get <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building to the other. The block schedule decreased the amount of time students spent in the hallways. Study halls were eliminated and graduation requirements were gradually increased from 21 to 28 credits required for graduation. All students are required to take four credits each in English, math, science and social studies. An honors program was developed and Advanced Placement offerings were increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps transported {{supplies}} to the fighting troops, <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sinai and Palestine Campaign to the other; from the desert of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula to the northern Levant (now Syria). They saw service transporting supplies of all kinds across the flooded plain north of Gaza and Beersheba, up into the rocky inhospitable Judean Hills towards Jerusalem in late 1917, down the precipitous tracks to Jericho in the Jordan Valley, up into the even less hospitable hills of Moab towards Es Salt and Amman and also followed on the great victorious advance northwards in 1918, carrying ammunition, water and all types of stores {{for the men and}} horses of the fighting units at the front, and carried the wounded back.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the open-ring isomers are colorless compounds, {{whereas the}} closed-ring isomers have colors {{dependent}} on their chemical structure, due to the extended conjugation along the molecular backbone. Therefore, many diarylethenes have photochromic behavior both in solution and in solid state. Moreover, these two isomers differ from one another not only in their absorption spectra but also in various physical and chemical properties, such as their refractive indices, dielectric constants, and oxidation-reduction potentials. These properties can be readily controlled by reversible isomerization between the open- and closed-ring states using photoirradiation, and thus they have been suggested for use in optical data storage and 3D optical data storage in particular. The closed form has a conjugated path <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule to the other, whereas the open form has not. This allows for the electronic communication between functional groups attached to the far ends of the diarylethene to be switched on and off using UV and visible light.|$|E
