40|$|Abstract: The network {{paradigm}} is increasingly {{used to describe}} the dynamics of complex systems. Here we review the current results and propose <b>future</b> <b>development</b> <b>areas</b> in the assessment of perturbation waves, i. e. propagating structural changes in amino acid networks building individual protein molecules and in protein-protein interaction networks (interactomes). We assess the possibilities and critically review the initial attempts for the application of game theory to the often rather complicated process, when two protein molecules approach each other, mutually adjust their conformations via multiple communication steps and finally, bind to each other. We also summarize available data on the application of percolation theory for the prediction of amino acid network- and interactome-dynamics. Furthermore, we give an overview of the dissection of signals and noise in the cellular context of various perturbations. Finally, we propose possible applications of the reviewed methodologies in drug design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Until recently, {{stormwater}} {{management strategies}} {{have failed to}} adequately consider the criticality of spatially varying soil permeability values and their implications on drainage designs. This case study {{was carried out in}} new <b>development</b> <b>areas,</b> focusing on identification of soil properties and development of a typology of suitable stormwater management strategies with respect to applicable infiltration capacities. The Guelph Permeameter was used to investigate the in-situ saturated hydraulic conductivities. Test results were categorized into four main permeability groups, very rapid (> 1. 56 m/day), rapid (0. 48 < 1. 56 m/day), moderate (0. 12 < 0. 48 m/day) and slow (< 0. 12 m/day), based on the theoretical requirements of stormwater management techniques. Finally, {{with the help of the}} existing soil maps, the point represent hydraulic conductivity data were been generalized logically in order to develop the hydraulic conductivity maps representing the areal average as an electronic shape files by using a GIS Arc view mapping software. The <b>future</b> <b>development</b> <b>areas</b> under Central Maddington, Kenwick, Central and Outer Beckenham have been identified as low permeable areas which is not suitable for infiltration based stormwater management strategies whereas the Landford, Thornlie, North Huntingdale and Gosnells has been identified as high permeable areas which is highly recommended for infiltration based stormwater management strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of China 2 ̆ 7 s tour guiding quality assurance system as an instrument for sustainable tourism. It notes the importance of China 2 ̆ 7 s 131, 000 tour guides for inbound, outbound and domestic tourism. China 2 ̆ 7 s tour guiding quality assurance and regulatory mechanisms are then reviewed, including qualification examination, licensing, professional certification, training, awards for excellence, professional associations and codes of conduct. Structurally, China 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive and comparatively regulated system may be recommendable to other countries, particularly its certification and licensing systems. However, {{the findings suggest that}} tour guide quality assurance in China may be constrained by an over-reliance on government and the absence of industry-driven mechanisms for some elements such as monitoring, enforcement and rewarding excellence. Most importantly, the focus of China 2 ̆ 7 s quality assurance system is on a limited number of tour guiding roles and tends to overlook those most critical to harnessing the guide as a vehicle for sustainable tourism.
