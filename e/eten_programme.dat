40|$|Information {{technology}} {{applications in}} medicine are rapidly expanding, and new methods and solutions are evolving {{since they are}} considered pivotal {{in the success of}} preventive medicine. In this paper two different concepts will be presented, the PANACEIA-iTV and the e-Vital concept. PANACEIA-iTV is a home care service provision system based on interactive TV technology and supported by the IST programme of the European Commission. The e-Vital service, supported by the <b>eTEN</b> <b>programme</b> of the European Commission, regards an integrated homecare and telemonitoring service chain aimed at large sensitive parts of the European population, the ""at-risk"" citizens. Both concepts developed a generic, flexible and adaptable framework for the combination of heterogeneous information sources and the creation of the individualised wellness (i-wellness) profile for prognostic purposes and early intervention. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There are {{significant}} barriers preventing many users, often disadvantaged citizens such as {{people with disabilities}} and elderly people, from accessing many services and information provided by e-solutions, especially governmental and commercial web sites and public access systems. Tenuta is a project funded by the European Union (EU) that is helping improve the usability and accessibility of e-services supported by the EU <b>eTEN</b> <b>programme,</b> by providing guidance on how to produce e-services that are not only accessible, but also easy to use. The paper explains why usability and accessibility are important and {{the economic and social}} benefits that can be obtained from improved usability and accessibility. Tenuta has supported projects in the use of well established but pragmatic usability and accessibility methods and techniques. Projects are reviewed, e-solutions evaluated and improvements to both process and product recommended. Few projects have existing expertise in this area, which presents a major risk to the successful uptake of the project results...|$|E
40|$|There are {{significant}} barriers preventing many users, often disadvantaged citizens such as {{people with disabilities}} and the elderly, from accessing many services and information provided by e-solutions, especially governmental and commercial web sites and public access systems. Tenuta is a project funded by the EU from 2005 to 2007 that will help improve the usability and accessibility of transnational EU e-services supported by the EU <b>eTEN</b> <b>programme.</b> The paper explains why usability and accessibility are important in the eTEN application domains (eInclusion, eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning), and {{the economic and social}} benefits that can be obtained. Tenuta will support projects in the use of well established but pragmatic usability and accessibility methods and techniques. Projects will be reviewed, e-solutions evaluated and improvements to both process and product recommended. A major challenge is to employ methods and techniques that with a few days support can transfer appropriate skills to organisations that may have limited previous experience in usability and accessibility. The Tenuta partners are leading experts in the fields of usability and accessibility, and will make use of the extensive resources from previous EU projects to produce simpler, easy to apply guidance on the use of straightforward techniques combining usability and accessibility. ...|$|E
40|$|The Project European Privacy Open Space (PrivacyOS) aims at {{bringing}} together industry, SMEs, Government, Academia and Civil Society to foster development and deployment of privacy infrastructures for Europe. The general objectives of PrivacyOS are {{to create a}} longterm collaboration in the thematic network and establish collective interfaces with other EU projects. Participants exchange research and best practices, as well as develop strategies and joint projects following four core policy goals: Awareness-rising, enabling privacy on the Web, fostering privacy-friendly Identity Management, and stipulating research. [...] . This report focuses on the 3 rd PrivacyOS conference, which was held in Vienna, October 26 th and 27 th 2009, co-located with the Austrian Big Brother Awards. 50 participants attended the conference and devised the agenda with 21 presentations in two parallel tracks. The topics of the presentations discussed included, amongst others: data protection awareness, data protection in healthcare, data protection in the Web 2. 0, privacy-related technologies such as EnCoRe, TOR or Microformats as well as regulatory, cultural and sociological implications of data protection. Also at the 3 rd PrivacyOS conference the software product “KiwiSecurity” was awarded the EuroPriSe Seal (European Privacy Seal, www. european-privacy-seal. eu). EuroPriSe is an initiative of the data protection authority Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein (ULD), Germany. It has been started as a European Project under the <b>eTEN</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present how {{interoperability}} is {{achieved in the}} MichaelPlus project. MichaelPlus uses the Michael platform for knowledge organization and presentation of the content provided by the archives participating in the project. The Michael platform supports interoperability in the schema, record and repository levels. The end user {{has the ability to}} make cross-lingual queries to all the archives through the controlled vocabularies embedded in the platform. Scalability of the platform is achieved through schema mapping techniques and metadata can be harvested using the OAI-PMH standard. However, since the Michael platform is based on XML, we can not ensure semantic interoperability. The future plan of the MichaelPlus project is to upgrade the platform using Semantic Web technologies. These technologies will provide declarative and procedural semantics of the metadata records aiming at semantic interoperability. We present two methods in which semantic interoperability can be achieved. The first method is through the use of the SKOS vocabularies. The second method is to apply ontology alignment techniques. 1 The MichaelPlus Project Michael-Multilingual Inventory of Cultural Heritage in Europe is a deployment initiative supported by two projects cofinanced by the <b>eTEN</b> <b>programme,</b> namely: Michael (2004 - 2007) and MichaelPlus (2006 - 2008). The scope of the initiative is to celebrate the richness, breadth and diversity of the European cultural heritage by promoting it to a worldwide audience through the Internet. The MichaelPlus consortium brings together public and private bodies: national and regional cultural ministries, state agencies, major cultural institutions and technical partners with specific expertise. The consortium was born in 200...|$|E
