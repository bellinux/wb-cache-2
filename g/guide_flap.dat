40|$|AbstractIntroductionClosure of the {{perineum}} following radical {{excision of}} pelvic tumours can {{prove to be}} a complex surgical problem. A number of pedicled flaps have been used for perineal reconstruction in order to reduce post-operative complications such as infection and abscess formation. The aim of this case series was to analyse the use of pre-operative computer tomography (CT) angiography to <b>guide</b> <b>flap</b> selection for perineal reconstruction following radical excision of pelvic tumours. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review to identify all patients who underwent CT angiography prior to radical excision of pelvic tumours and planned flap reconstruction over an 18 month period. Six patients were identified and are presented in this case series. Patients' medical records, histology reports, pre-operative investigations and CT angiograms, complications and follow-up were reviewed. ResultsThe mean patient age was 58. 3 years, with a male to female ratio of 1 : 2. Four out of six patients (66. 6 %) underwent pre-operative radiotherapy. The deep inferior epigastric arteries (DIEA) were visualised in all six cases (100 %) and the pre-operative CT angiography helped <b>guide</b> <b>flap</b> choice in all cases (100 %). In one case, narrowing of the DIEA vessels was noted precluding the use of a DIEA-based flap. One patient had a minor superficial wound dehiscence. ConclusionPre-operative CT angiography allows accurate visualisation of the DIEA system including perforator vessels. CT angiography is a useful tool, providing the surgical team with significant additional information to aid pre-operative planning and optimise reconstructive choice and outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Gingival {{recession}} progression {{in clinical}} practice as an ethiological factor of periodontal diseases, {{and symptoms of}} the disease have caused the development of various surgical procedures and techniques of the reconstruction of periodontal defects. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify efficacy of surgical procedures that include connective tissue autotransplants with periosteum and guided tissue regeneration for the treatment of gingival recession. Methods. The study included 20 teet with gingival recession, Müller class II and III. Ten teeth with gingival recession were treated with resorptive membrane and coronary <b>guided</b> surgical <b>flap</b> (GTR group). On the contralateral side 10 teeth with gingival recession were treated with connective tissue autotransplants with periosteum in combination with coronary <b>guided</b> surgical <b>flap</b> (TVT group). We measured the degree of epithelial attachment (DEA), width of subgingival curettage (WGC) and vertical deepness of recession (VDR). For statistical significance we used Student's ttest. Results. The study revealed statistical significance in reducing VDR by both used treatments. Root deepness in GTR and TVT group was 63. 5 %, and 90 %, respectively. With both surgical techniques we achieved coronary dislocation of the epithelial attachment, larger zone of gingival curettage, and better oral hygiene. Conclusion. Current surgical techniques are effective in the regeneration of deep periodontal spaces and the treatment of gingival recession. Significantly better results were achieved with the used coronary <b>guided</b> surgical <b>flap</b> than with <b>guided</b> tissue regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{head and}} neck {{reconstruction}} have resulted in improved outcomes with single-stage repair of defects ranging from intraoral to pharyngoesophageal to skull base defects. Key to success of surgery is choosing an appropriate reconstructive option based on the patient's wishes and fitness for major surgery. Where possible, free tissue transfer provides the best functional and aesthetic outcomes {{for the vast majority}} of defects. In this article, we present an algorithm to <b>guide</b> choice of <b>flap</b> selection and review principles of reconstruction and secondary surgery for {{head and neck}} defects...|$|R
40|$|As {{endoscopic}} {{skull base}} resections have advanced, appropriate reconstruction has become paramount. The reconstructive {{options for the}} skull base include both avascular and vascular grafts. We review these and provide an algorithm for endoscopic skull base reconstruction. One hundred and sixty-six skull base dural defects, reconstructed with an endonasal vascular flap, were examined. As an adjunct, avascular reconstruction techniques are discussed to illustrate all options for endonasal skull base reconstruction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rates are also discussed. Small CSF leaks may be successfully repaired with various avascular grafting techniques. Endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs) to the skull base often have larger dural defects with high-flow CSF leaks. Success rates for some EEA procedures utilizing avascular grafts approach 90 %, yet in high-flow leak situations, success rates are much lower (50 to 70 %). Defect location and complexity <b>guides</b> vascularized <b>flap</b> choice. When nasoseptal flaps are unavailable, anterior/sellar defects are best managed with an endoscopically harvested pericranial flap, whereas clival/posterior defects may be reconstructed with an inferior turbinate or temporoparietal flap. An endonasal skull base reconstruction algorithm was constructed and points to increased use of various vascularized reconstructions for more complex skull base defects...|$|R
5000|$|These {{last three}} designs changed the wing {{geometry}} by extending the wing rearwards {{at right angles}} to the trailing edge. Akaflieg Darmstadt took a different approach, pivoting the single piece flap near the tip and sliding it out from within the wing trailing edge, gaining the mechanism the nickname [...] "penknife wing". As it is extended, a track in the fuselage side <b>guides</b> the thin <b>flap</b> into its high camber position at the wing root. The wing area is increased by 21% with the flaps extended. Although this arrangement avoids the vortexes at the flap tip, like any area increasing method used on a fixed span wing it results in a lower aspect ratio and hence a lower lift to drag ratio.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Gingival {{recession}} progression {{in clinical}} practaice has influenced {{the development of}} various surgical procedures and techniques for solving esthetic imperfections and subjective difficulties coused by gingival recession. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify efficacy of surgical procedures and to compare both of surgical procedures through the keratinized tissue width. Methods. The study included 20 teeth with gingival recesion, Müller class I and II. Ten teeth with gingival recession were treated with connective tissue autotransplants with periosteum in combination with coronary <b>guided</b> surgical <b>flap</b> (CTG group). On the contralateral side 10 teeth with gingival recession were treated with the same surgical procedures but in combination with platelet-rich plasma (CTGPRP group). We measured the keratinized tissue width. For statistical significance we used the Student's t-test. Results. The study reveled a statistical significance in reducing vertical deepress of recession by both used treatments. Root deepness in CTG and CTG-PRP group was 90 % and 93. 5 %, respectively. With both surgical techniques we achieved larger zone of keratinized gingiva but with a wide zone of keratinized tissue in CTG - the PRP group. Conclusion. The concept regeneration technique with PRP and with the stimulating influence of platele activated growth factors results in the regeneration of deep periodontal tissue as an important prerequisite for the successful treatment of gingival recession...|$|R

The demand for periodontal plastic surgery appears to be increasing. Several methods have been used in the treatment of denuded roots. Of these, the free gingival autograft, the coronally displaced <b>flap,</b> <b>guided</b> tissue regeneration, and, lately, the connective tissue graft appear to be the main methods employed. There are as yet no reports of periodontal plastic surgery performed in Nigeria. We report two cases of Miller&rsquo;s Class 2 gingival recession treated by free gingival autografts in the specialist periodontal clinic of a South-Western teaching hospital in Nigeria. The challenges of awareness, a dearth of expertise, cost of materials, consequent cost of treatment, and how these affect the accessing of treatment are highlighted. The methods used in getting over these hurdles to provide treatment are also discussed. Keywords: gingival recession, free gingival autograft, Nigeri...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the accuracy of the model-based NobelGuide method in transferring preoperative planning and estimation of bone volume to the surgical situation. Thirteen implant replicas were placed in bounded edentulous spaces in nine human cadavers. Highly restrictive guides were fabricated using preoperative bone mapping data. A stone cast was modified to represent the bone contours at the implant site. Postoperative impressions were taken for comparison with the planning cast that had been used to generate the <b>guides.</b> Mucoperiosteal <b>flaps</b> were raised over each implant site, and the areas were inspected for fenestrations, thread exposures, or dehiscences. A coordinate measuring device was used to obtain positional and angular information from each implant placed in the planned and postsurgical casts. These were compared and analyzed for clinical and statistical significance. The median value for linear accuracy in three dimensions for the model-based NobelGuide was 0. 48 mm and the median angular deviation was 2. 88 degrees. The greatest measured errors were still within clinically acceptable limits. The bone mapping was of sufficient diagnostic value for implant placement in sites with sufficient bone volume (greater than 5 mm buccolingually). In sites with insufficient bone volume, dehiscences were seen, but the accuracy was independent of bone volume. The use of the model-based NobelGuide encourages adherence to the restorative-driven approach. The accuracy of the method is within acceptable limits for guided surgery described in the literature, and the use of the bone mapping is satisfactory in cases with adequate bone volume. The technique can also be used in sites with insufficient bone volume, but a mucoperiosteal flap procedure is recommended. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 2010; 25 : 999 - 1006...|$|R
