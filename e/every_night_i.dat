There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup.

500|$|Filming in Las Vegas {{took place}} mostly in hotels owned by Howard Hughes, {{since he was}} a friend of Cubby Broccoli. Getting the streets empty to shoot was {{achieved}} through the collaboration of Hughes, the Las Vegas police and shopkeepers association. The Las Vegas Hilton doubled for the Whyte House, and since the owner of the Circus Circus was a Bond fan, he allowed the Circus to be used on film and even made a cameo. The cinematographers said filming in Las Vegas at night had an advantage: no additional illumination was required due to the high number of neon lights. Sean Connery made the most of his time on location in Las Vegas. [...] "I didn't get any sleep at all. We shot <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> caught all the shows and played golf all day.

2500|$|The Kings named Brown the 13th {{captain in}} team history on October 8, 2008, {{just after the}} start of the 2008–09 season. Brown's {{appointment}} filled the vacancy created when prior captain Rob Blake left the Kings in free agency to sign with the San Jose Sharks on July 3, 2008. Just 23 years old when he assumed the captaincy, Brown became the youngest captain and the only American captain in Kings history. Head Coach Terry Murray pointed to Brown's work ethic and commitment to the Kings to explain the decision, saying Brown [...] "shows that he cares tremendously about this team, about winning <b>every</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> just want him to follow through with that, and he will because that's his personality. Just keep blazing that trail, and players on the team will follow." [...] Kings management was impressed by Brown's emergence as a vocal leader in the locker room, especially after the departure of veteran presences Mattias Norström and Rob Blake. On the ice, Brown's numbers dipped slightly from 2007–08, in part because of an 8.2% shooting percentage, his lowest since his rookie season. His 292 shots led the team, however, and his 24 goals were third. Brown was chosen to represent the Western Conference at the 2009 All-Star Game. The Kings missed the playoffs for a franchise-worst sixth straight year.|$|E
2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost <b>every</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats <b>every</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour. Upon the release of Never Gone, AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys described his hair as resembling [...] "Janet Jackson on the Velvet Rope Tour." ...|$|E
