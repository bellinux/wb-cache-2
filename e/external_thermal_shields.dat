40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{procedures}} {{for determining the}} vial heat transfer coefficient {{and the extent of}} primary drying through manometric temperature measurement (MTM). The vial heat transfer coefficients (Kv) were calculated from the MTM-determined temperature and resistance and compared with Kv values determined by a gravimetric method. The differences between the MTM vial heat transfer coefficients and the gravimetric values are large at low shelf temperature but smaller when higher shelf temperatures were used. The differences also became smaller at higher chamber pressure and smaller when higher resistance materials were being freeze-dried. In all cases, using <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> greatly improved the accuracy of the MTM Kv measurement. With use of <b>thermal</b> <b>shields,</b> the thickness of the frozen layer calculated from MTM is in good agreement with values obtained gravimetrically. The heat transfer coefficient “error” is largely {{a direct result of the}} error in the dry layer resistance (ie, MTM-determined resistance is too low).

These <b>thermal</b> <b>shields</b> helped reduce the problem of thermal gradient- induced jitter observed with the original HST solar arrays during orbital thermal cycling and have been in use on HST for eight years. This paper describes ground testing of the candidate solar array bi-stem <b>thermal</b> <b>shield</b> materials including backside aluminized Teflon(R) FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) with and without atomic oxygen (AO) and ultraviolet radiation protective surface coatings for durability to AO and combined AO and vacuum ultraviolet (VOV) radiation. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) conducted VUV and AO exposures of samples of candidate <b>thermal</b> <b>shield</b> materials at HST operational temperatures and pre- and post-exposure analyses {{as part of an}} overall program coordinated by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to determine the on-orbit durability of these materials. Coating adhesion problems were observed for samples having the AO- and combined AO/UV-protective coatings. Coating lamination occurred with rapid thermal cycling testing which simulated orbital thermal cycling. This lack of adhesion caused production of coating flakes from the material that would have posed a serious risk to HST optics if the coated materials were used for the bi-stem <b>thermal</b> <b>shields.</b> No serious degradation was observed for the uncoated aluminized Teflon(R) as evaluated by optical microscopy, although atomic force microscopy (AFM) microhardness testing revealed that an embrittled surface layer formed on the uncoated Teflon(R) surface due to vacuum ultraviolet radiation exposure.

The expansion and contraction, although very small, was enough to cause the telescope to shake because of thermal-induced jitters, a detrimental effect when trying to take pictures millions of miles away.
