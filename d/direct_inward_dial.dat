5000|$|Most {{voice over}} IP {{providers}} offer virtual numbers; unbundled providers label these as [...] "DIDs" [...] (<b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial).</b> These are typically offered as local geographic numbers in various selected cities or as toll-free numbers, with the non-geographic number carrying higher per-minute cost to receive calls.|$|E
50|$|In systems without <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> capability, all {{calls for}} a large {{organisation}} originally were placed to the facility's main number, where a switchboard operator or attendant would ask which extension or department the caller intended to reach. The call would then be transferred manually. As soon as the front office closed for the day, the system would be unusable for inbound calls.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of competition, each {{individual}} carrier required its own prefixes in each rate center in each municipality, depleting available prefixes within high-growth and high-competition areas. (These were already under pressure due to increased use of <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> PBX extensions, mobile telephones, pagers, fax machines and dial-up modems at the time). Many of these new prefixes were largely empty. This led to a rapid increase in {{the introduction of new}} area codes.|$|E
50|$|PRI {{channels}} and <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> are also common {{as a means}} of delivering inbound calls to voice over IP gateways from the PSTN.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, PortaOne, Inc. {{announced}} its VoIP management platform, PortaSwitch, to be interoperable with DIDWW’s Global <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing</b> Solutions. This collaboration created a seamless combined {{use of the}} two infrastructures.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2009, Iristel and Algeria Telecom {{announce}} {{an exclusive}} agreement to offer Inbound <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialling</b> (DID) services to subscribers {{around the world}} who want an Algerian number for their existing phone line ...|$|R
50|$|The Norstar system {{went further}} than the other systems in {{similarity}} to a PBX system such as the Meridian SL-1/Meridian 1 system developed in the late 1980s as well. This allowed blurring the distinction of key telephone system versus PBX telephone system. Many features such as <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dial,</b> Caller ID, Automatic Call Distribution, and Call Accounting were designed off the larger Meridian 1 PBX, DMS-100 and Meridian SL-100 {{as opposed to being}} developed as an independent system.|$|E
50|$|Widespread {{introduction}} of automated mobile phone service in 1983 created two competing carriers in each city. Additional mobile carriers entered {{the market to}} provide digital service (such as GSM, introduced in 1991). In 1985, competitive access providers (CAPs) began to offer private line and special access services; originally based on PBX standards such as <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial,</b> these evolved into full competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC). The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required incumbent telephone companies to interconnect with the new entrants.|$|E
50|$|For {{voice over}} IP resellers, some {{specialized}} CLECs (for local numbers) or interexchange carriers (for toll-free numbers) will deliver blocks of <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> calls already converted to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or common VoIP formats. The individual VoIP provider need only obtain {{an inventory of}} local or freephone numbers from VoIP-aware carriers in various regions, import them in bulk to a VoIP PBX (such as Asterisk) and issue them individually to end users. International DID numbers can be purchased in bulk from international providers.|$|E
50|$|Automated attendants provide, {{among many}} other things, a way for an {{external}} caller to be directed to an extension or department served by a PBX system without using <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing</b> or without switchboard attendant assistance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{canonical}} {{address is}} a text string {{with the following}} format: [...] Area code, subaddress and name are optional; the latter can carry extension number for <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> and calling party name, as used by ISDN/E1/T1 telecommunication protocols.|$|R
50|$|When the PBX {{is capable}} of <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing,</b> the {{extension}} number should be written directly after the phone number, without using any distinct symbols. If {{there is a need}} to indicate in-dialing capability of the telephone number, a number of dots (....) corresponding to the length of the extension number can be added at the end.|$|R
50|$|Some {{businesses}} {{find that}} the human touch can improve contact, thus sales, but traditional wired answering services are expensive, so they have their calls forwarded to a call center, so the client can reach an operator instead of an answering machine or voice mail. Before the availability of call forwarding, commercial answering services needed to physically connect to every line for which they provided after-hours response; this required their offices be located near the local central exchange and be fed by a huge multi-pair trunk in which a separate pair of wires existed for each client subscriber. With call forwarding, there is no physical connection to the client's main telephone service, which is merely call-forwarded to the answering service (usually on a <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> number) {{at the end of}} the business day.|$|E
50|$|Addresses {{allocated}} {{from this}} range {{will be based}} upon the ITU-T e.164 telephone number assigned to the current subscriber {{of a range of}} telephone numbers, rather than to the service provider carrying those numbers. For example, if a university held +1.919.226.6100 through +1.919.226.6199, then that university would be eligible for the GDS prefix 00191922661. That university could assign the remaining two digits to endpoints 00-99. Aside from maintaining <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> (DID) capability for endpoints, {{there is no reason to}} limit endpoint numbering to two digits. For example, the university might use five digit endpoint numbers for a total address space of 001919226610000 through 001919226619999, yielding 10,000 usable addresses. Organizations that do not have a DID range may use this extension technique to map their entire address space onto a single 10-digit telephone number. Implementors of voice over IP applications may wish to adhere more strictly to the NANP numbering convention.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{voice over}} IP (VoIP) vendors have used one central, {{remotely}} located fax server {{as a means}} of offering Internet fax service to their clients. In theory, standards such as T.38 should have allowed VoIP subscribers to keep their existing fax equipment working locally; in practice, T.38 at the subscriber's site offers no benefit if the upstream provider is least-cost routing to gateways that don't support T.38 and cannot reliably send or receive fax/modem traffic. A fax server at a central location, connected directly to public switched telephone network (PSTN) T-carrier primary rate interface lines and using <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> to identify the intended addressee can convert an incoming fax to an electronic document (such as [...]tif or [...]pdf) for web or e-mail delivery. The fax traffic never passes through the VoIP infrastructure as a dial-up modem call and therefore arrives reliably even if T.38 is not properly supported at some points in the network.|$|E
50|$|A virtual number, {{also known}} as <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> (DID) or access number, is a {{telephone}} number without a directly associated telephone line. Usually these numbers are programmed to forward incoming calls {{to one of the}} pre-set telephone numbers, chosen by the client: fixed, mobile or VoIP. A virtual number can work like a gateway between traditional calls (PSTN) and VOIP.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} number assignments may {{be independent of}} any <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> (DID) services provided by external telecommunication vendors. For numbers without DID access, the internal switch relays externally originated calls via an operator, an automated attendant or an electronic interactive voice response system. Telephone numbers for users within such systems are often published by suffixing the official telephone number with the extension number, e.g., 1-800-555-0001 x2055.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{is often}} used in {{referring}} to a VoIP trunking service that provides the ability for calls to originate on the PSTN and be delivered to a customer's VoIP endpoint. It {{is often referred to}} as [...] "DID" [...] (for <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing)</b> which more properly refers to a service entirely within the PSTN where individual PSTN numbers can terminate on a customer's PBX.|$|R
5000|$|Some VoIP {{providers}} {{allow the}} user to configure their displayed number {{as part of the}} configuration page on the provider's web interface. No additional software is required. If the caller name is sent with the call (instead of being generated from the number by a database lookup at destination) it may be configured as part of the settings on a client-owned analog telephone adapter or SIP phone. The level of flexibility is provider-dependent. A provider which allows users to bring their own device and unbundles service so that <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial</b> numbers may be purchased separately from outbound calling minutes will be more flexible. A carrier which doesn't follow established hardware standards (such as Skype) or locks subscribers out of configuration settings on hardware which the subscriber owns outright (such as Vonage) is more restrictive. Providers which market [...] "wholesale VoIP" [...] are typically intended to allow any displayed number to be sent, as resellers will want their end user's numbers to appear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} InWATS {{system was}} supplanted by [...] "Advanced 800 Service" [...] in the 1980s. Modern systems eliminated requirements tying toll-free numbers to dedicated flat-rate inbound WATS lines. <b>Direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dial,</b> introduced in 1983, allowed one trunk to carry calls for multiple numbers. AT&T's monopoly on U.S. toll-free number routing ended in 1986, encouraging flexibility {{in order to}} match rivals Sprint and MCI. By 1989, fixed [...] "bands" [...] of coverage area had been largely replaced by distance-based billing, {{a growing number of}} 1-800 numbers were being terminated at standard local business or residence lines and one number could be sent to multiple locations based on call origin, least-cost routing or time of day routing. RespOrgs were established in the U.S. in 1993 and Canada in 1994 to provide toll free number portability using the Service Management System (SMS/800) database. Calls from Canada and the U.S., intrastate and interstate, could terminate at the same 1-800 number, even via different carriers. Vanity numbers became easier to obtain as a toll-free exchange prefix was no longer tied to a geographic location. By the 21st century, Voice over IP placed toll-free and foreign exchange numbers into the hands of even the smallest users, to whom dedicated inbound lines under the original InWATS model would have been prohibitively expensive.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this point}} it would good to state {{that there are two}} types of T-1 circuits; Channelized T-1 and Full T-1 - (Channelized T-1) is where by you have 24 {{channels}} of 64k each that can carry voice traffic and commonly found as the CO (Central Office) trunk in a PBX. In this case a DID or <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dial</b> would be used. A DID is where by you would have a T-1 and have say 100 phone numbers used to dial in to a business. The chances that all 24 channels of the T-1 being used at the same time would be small, however the PBX and business would need to study the capacity needed for multi T-1s. These same T-1 channels can also be used for out bound calls as well. (Full T-1) is where you use the entire 1.544 Mb of the T-1 for data. This data can be anything from company servers or the internet. Any data can be placed on the Full T-1. It’s worth noting, you can place data on a channelized T-1, but you’re limited to the 64k bandwidth of the channel. Several channels can be used to add capacity. The T-1 uses a pair of twisted copper wires from the CO (Central Office) the local on premise NIU (network Interface Unit) card. Pictured to the above right is a two card wall mount cabinet. Under the wall cabinet is a smart jack (RJ45). The NIU then uses 4 twisted copper wires to the end device (i.e. CISCO Router, Firewall, PBX, etc.) by a Cat 3 or high network type jumper cable.|$|E

Voxbone also supports local number portability and offers the ability to port existing local telephone numbers from other local service providers to its network.|$|R

50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> (DID), {{also called}} direct dial-in (DDI) in Europe and Oceania, is a {{telecommunication}} service offered by telephone companies to subscribers who operate a {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) system. The feature provides service for multiple telephone numbers over one or more analog or digital physical circuits to the PBX, and transmits the dialed telephone number to the PBX so that a PBX extension is directly accessible for an outside caller, possibly by-passing an auto-attendant.|$|R

Users can download it for Free and can make FriendCaller-to-FriendCaller Voice and Video calls with cheap call rates to landlines and mobile phones. Also includes Texting/SMS to over 400 Global networks. The app supports <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing,</b> Multi-lingual aid and IM's which are possible during a LIVE Video Call. The app is accessible to over 1022 Android devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Wide Area Telephone Service is obsolete. North American toll-free {{numbers are}} controlled by an intelligent network database (SMS/800) in which any toll-free number may be directed to a local or long-distance geographic telephone number, a T-carrier or primary rate interface line {{under the control of}} any of various RespOrgs. <b>Direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> and toll-free number portability are supported; various providers offer gateways which receive free phone calls on PRI lines and deliver them to voice over IP or pager users.|$|R
50|$|When Touch-Tone {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) tone generator also required correct polarity as it depended on the line D.C. voltage for operation. Later Touch-Tone telephones included a diode bridge that eliminated the polarity sensitivity, so that consumer telephone service is essentially immune to reversal today. However, some special circuits, such as some <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> (DID) trunks, T-1 lines, and ground start lines connected to field side (terminal) equipment, e.g., a corporate private branch exchange (PBX) switch, correctly operate only with proper tip and ring polarity.|$|R
5000|$|While persons {{within an}} {{enterprise}} {{served by a}} PBX can call each other by dialing their extension numbers, incoming calls, i.e., calls originating from a telephone not served by the PBX but intended for a party served by the PBX, required assistance from a switchboard operator (also called a [...] "switchboard attendant") or a telephone service called DID ("Direct <b>Inward</b> Dialing"). <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing</b> has advantages such as rapid connection to the destination party and disadvantages including cost, lack of identification of the called organization and use of ten-digit telephone numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attendant}} console {{may also be}} sent other calls that the PBX may not otherwise know how to handle, such as <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialed</b> calls that are not associated with a valid extension. The {{attendant console}} typically has no restrictions about the types of calls that may be made from it so the attendant may complete calls for restricted extensions. This is typically the case where a phone is placed in a public location, such as a lobby, but is set up so that it cannot dial long distance or international calls. Callers using the public phone must dial the attendant, who can complete the call for them.|$|R
50|$|Most modern non-VoIP PBXs use ISDN-PRI circuits. These are {{connected}} via T1 lines {{with the central}} office switch, replacing older analog two-way and <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> (DID) trunks. PRI is capable of delivering Calling Line Identification (CLID) in both directions so that the telephone number of an extension, rather than a companys main number, can be sent. It is still commonly used in recording studios, when a voice-over actor is in one studio (possibly telecommuting from home), but the director and producer are in a studio at another location. The ISDN protocol delivers channelized, not-over-the-Internet service, powerful call setup and routing features, faster setup and tear down, superior audio fidelity as compared to POTS (plain old telephone service), lower delay and, at higher densities, lower cost.|$|R
50|$|For <b>direct</b> <b>inward</b> <b>dialing</b> service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring {{only a limited number of}} physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.|$|R
50|$|Jaxtr is {{a social}} {{communications}} company that melds together global calling, SMS, and social networking. Founded by Phillip Mobin and Touraj Parang in October 2005, jaxtr uses Voice over Internet Protocol to offer competitive rates as well as free international and long distance calling. Some key differentiators for jaxtr in its market include allowing phone-to-phone calls to and from any mobile and landline phones, offering social networking focused on voice (café jaxtr), requiring no software downloads or access pins, and giving users local <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DID) phone numbers. Offered in 56 countries, these numbers allow users in those countries to dial a local phone number which would ring a long distance or international destination phone. Jaxtr also offers users a set number of global SMS messages each month.|$|R
5000|$|Centrex obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or PBX. Instead, telephone extensions, called Centrex lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a key telephone system for a small office within the large corporate Centrex, in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as <b>Direct</b> <b>Inward</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a Centrex environment. Stations may also be part of a hunt group, allowing for automatic distribution of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|R
