5|$|The Hokies' kickoff {{after the}} {{defensive}} score was caught at {{the goal line}} {{and returned to the}} 28-yard line by Boston College's Chris Fox. Following the return, Davis completed a seven-yard pass to the 35-yard line, then picked up a first down to the 42-yard line with another pass. Davis then scrambled three yards and threw for another first down, this time to tight end Lars Anderson. Now at the Tech 46-yard line, Davis threw three incomplete passes before throwing another on fourth down. With 6:39 remaining in the game, Boston College turned the ball over on downs to the Virginia Tech offense. The Hokies again began to run out the clock. Evans ran the ball three consecutive times, but on the third rush, Evans <b>fumbled</b> <b>for</b> the second time in the game. The fumble was recovered by Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich and Boston College's offense returned to the field.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the game}} {{appeared}} to be over. However, the Steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the Colts still had three timeouts remaining. But on Pittsburgh's first play, in which Bettis tried to punch it in for an insurance touchdown, he <b>fumbled</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time all}} season when linebacker Gary Brackett popped it from Bettis' hands with his helmet. Indianapolis defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and {{appeared to be}} on his way for an Indy touchdown that would have given the Colts the lead when Roethlisberger made a season saving tackle at the Colts' 42-yard line, spinning around and grabbing his ankle. Eventually, the Colts then advanced to the Pittsburgh 28-yard line, but Vanderjagt, who had been perfect at home in the playoffs, missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left, and the Steelers ran out the clock.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{fell into}} an early deficit when Buffalo quarterback Drew Willy {{completed}} {{a pass to}} Naam Roosevelt for a two-yard touchdown. The Cardinals responded midway through the second quarter as MiQuale Lewis ran for a four-yard touchdown. As the first half expired, Ian McGarvey kicked a 47-yard field goal to give the Cardinals a 10–7 lead. In the third quarter, Willy completed a 39-yard pass to Roosevelt to give the Bulls the lead 14–10. The Cardinals responded on the next drive, as Lewis concluded a seven-play, 65yard drive with his second touchdown of the game, this time on a one-yard run to give the Cardinals the lead. After recovering a fumble, the Cardinals offense {{made it all the}} way to the Buffalo one-yard line, but a two-yard loss and a false start penalty pushed the ball back to the eight-yard line. On the next play, Nate Davis attempted to dive into the end zone, but fumbled the ball and was recovered by Buffalo's Mike Newton, who ran the ball back 92yards for a touchdown. After getting to the Buffalo 15yard line, the Cardinals <b>fumbled</b> <b>for</b> the third time and was run back for a 74-yard touchdown by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott for a 28–17 lead. The Cardinals fourth fumble of the game, which was forced and recovered by Buffalo’s Adekunle Akingba, set up Willy’s third touchdown pass to Roosevelt on an eight-yard completion to increase the lead to 35–17. The Cardinals cut the Buffalo lead back to 11points with 4:17remaining in the game after a 22-yard completion from Davis to Louis Johnson. Needing to get the ball back quickly, the Cardinals attempted an onside kick after the score, which was recovered by the Bulls. Buffalo then extended its lead to 18points for a second time at 42–24, on a one-yard touchdown run by James Starks. An interception in the end zone with 41seconds remaining in the game sealed the win for Buffalo. The game received a 1.7Nielsen Rating, which set a Mid-American Conference record for the most viewers to ever watch a game involving two MAC teams on the ESPN family of networks. The Cardinals' fell to #23in the Associated Press poll and to #22in the USA Today and BCS poll.|$|E

2500|$|But {{confusion}} reigned at the company's marketing department, {{which had}} to come up with a plan to market two Coca-Colas where such plans had been completely off the table just a few months before. Coca-Cola Classic did not need much help, with a [...] "Red, White and You" [...] campaign showcasing the American virtues many of those who had clamored for its reintroduction had pointedly reminded the company it embodied. But the company was at a loss to sell what was now just Coke. [...] "The Best Just Got Better" [...] could no longer be used. Marketers <b>fumbled</b> <b>for</b> a strategy for the rest of the year. Matters were not helped when McDonald's announced shortly after the reintroduction that it was switching from New Coke back to Coca-Cola Classic at every store across the country.|$|E

2500|$|Collusion was practiced {{among various}} Champagne houses {{in order to}} drive down the prices of grapes to as a low as they would go, with the ever-present threat that if the houses could not get their grapes for cheap enough they would {{continue}} to source grapes from outside the region. Champenois vineyard owners {{found themselves in a}} situation where they were being paid less for fewer grapes. Poverty was widespread. In January 1911, frustrations reached their boiling point as riots erupted in the towns of Damery and Hautvilliers. Champenois vine growers intercepted trucks with grapes from the Loire Valley and pushed them into the Marne river. They then descended upon the warehouses of producers known to produce faux Champagne, tossing more wine and barrels into the Marne. The French Government tried to answer the vine growers' concerns by passing legislation defining where Champagne wine was to come from. This early legislation dictated that the Marne department and a few villages from the Aisne department were the only areas approved to grow grapes for Champagne production. The glaring exclusion of the Aube region, where the historic capital of Champagne—Troyes—is located, promoted further discontent as the Aubois protested the decision. The Aube, located south of the Marne, was closer to the Burgundy region in terms of soil and location. The growers of the Marne viewed the region as [...] "foreign" [...] and not capable of producing true Champagne but the Aubois viewed themselves as Champenois and clung to their historical roots. The government eventually reversed themselves and included the Aube-much to the dismay of vine growers in the Marne who vigorously protested the decision. More riots erupted and the region was on the brink of civil war. As the government <b>fumbled</b> <b>for</b> an answer that would appease both parties, World War I erupted and those issues had to be set aside as the entire country braced itself for war.|$|E
