2500|$|The {{evolution}} of Kelly's character led to developments both on-screen and off. In a 1995 article on Garth, TV Guide {{reported that the}} show's creators {{made a conscious decision}} to place her character at center stage. An anonymous producer cites [...] "faith in Jennie as an actress," [...] further stating that he and producer Aaron Spelling [...] "knew she had the chops to do it." [...] This development would gradually lead to Kelly supplanting Brenda as the prominent female lead, as the former received what the producer called [...] "better story lines." [...] Reportedly, these matters became a source of tension between Garth and Shannen Doherty, who played Brenda. Following Doherty's final appearance on the show in 1994, however, Garth stated, [...] "We were friends at work, and <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>her</b> most of the time." ...|$|E

Tell me, senor, my brother Ignacio writes me that he has captured many animals from the French--was Margaretta among them? She was a large mule, and in good condition; indeed, there was some flesh on her bones. She was a dark chestnut with a white star on the forehead, a little white on her fore feet, and white below the hocks on the hind legs; she had a soft eye, and a peculiar twist in jerking her tail." ...|$|E

Bless you! the old woman knew it as well as I did, though she pretended ignorance. And so she goes, and I'm alone again. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>her,</b> sir, tripping along that court, and coming for her singing lesson; and I've no heart to look into the porter's lodge now, which looks very empty without her, the little flirting thing. And I go and sit and dangle about her lodgings, like an old fool. She makes 'em very trim and nice, though; gets up all Huxter's shirts and clothes: cooks his little dinner, and sings at her business like a little lark. What's the use of being angry? I lent 'em three pound to go on with: for they haven't got a shilling till the reconciliation, and Pa comes down." ...|$|E

6000|$|Herr Stahr's {{desire to}} make a hero of his subject, and his love for sonorous {{sentences}} like those we have quoted above, are apt to stand somewhat {{in the way of}} our chance at taking a fair measure of the man, and seeing in what his heroism really lay. He furnishes little material for a comparative estimate of Lessing, or for judging of the foreign influences which helped {{from time to time in}} making him what he was. Nothing is harder than to worry out a date from Herr Stahr's haystacks of praise and quotation. Yet dates are of special value in tracing the progress of an intellect like Lessing's, which, little actuated by an inward creative energy, was commonly stirred to motion by the impulse of other minds, and struck out its brightest flashes by collision with them. He himself tells us that a critic should [...] "first seek out some one with whom he can contend," [...] and quotes in justification from one of Aristotle's commentators, Solet Aristoteles quaerere pugnam in suis libris. This Lessing was always wont to do. He could only feel his own strength, and make others feel it,--could only call it into full play in an intellectual wrestling-bout. He was always anointed and ready for the ring, but with this distinction, that he was no mere prize-fighter, or bully for the side that would pay him best, nor even a contender for mere sentiment, but a self-forgetful champion for the truth as he saw it. Nor is this true of him only as a critic. His more purely imaginative works--his Minna, his Emilia, his Nathan--were all written, not to satisfy the craving of a poetic instinct, nor to rid head and heart of troublous guests by building them a lodging outside himself, as Goethe used to do, but to prove some thesis of criticism or morals by which Truth could be served. His zeal for her was perfectly unselfish. [...] "Does one write, then, for the sake of being always in the right? I think I have been as serviceable to Truth," [...] he says, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>her,</b> and my failure is the occasion of another's discovering her, as if I had discovered her myself."[150] One would almost be inclined to think, from Herr Stahr's account of the matter, that Lessing had been an autochthonous birth of the German soil, without intellectual ancestry or helpful kindred. That this is the sufficient natural history of no original mind we need hardly say, since originality consists quite as much in the power of using to purpose what it finds ready to its hand, as in that of producing what is absolutely new. Perhaps we might say that it was nothing more than the faculty of combining the separate, and therefore ineffectual, conceptions of others, and making them into living thought by the breath of its own organizing spirit. A great man without a past, if he be not an impossibility, will certainly have no future. He would be like those conjectural Miltons and Cromwells of Gray's imaginary Hamlet. The only privilege of the original man is, that, like other sovereign princes, he has the right to call in the current coin and reissue it stamped with his own image, as was the practice of Lessing.|$|E

50|$|Behan {{migrated}} to London, {{where he found}} work with the BBC, writing radio scripts, mainly for the Third Programme. His play Posterity Be Damned, produced in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, in 1959, dealt with republican activity after the Civil War of 1922-23. An autobiographical novel Teems of Times (1961) was received to critical acclaim, (particularly from the Observer theatre critic Kenneth Tynan, who was uncharacteristically effusive in his praise); the book was subsequently dramatised for television in 1977 by RTÉ. His autobiography, Tell Dublin <b>I</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>Her,</b> was also published in 1961 and sold well in the USA. A biography of his brother entitled My Brother Brendan appeared in 1965, but due to a legal wrangle Behan received virtually none of the proceeds of this book.|$|E

She had a bawdy sense of humor. And of how many women, she stayed on that show for so many years, and well, well, well, with an older woman, which she was on, and still, they could shot her so tight with such beautiful close-ups, because, she had such not only, a beautiful face, when she continued to having as she aged, but the beauty and the light within her, in her spirit, it just truly say, 'A Star Shines.' She is the perfect example of that!" [...] She also responded if Lee had been like a 'surrogate grandmother' to Zeman, both on- and off- the camera, [...] "I have great respect and admiration for Anna Lee personally and professionally.

I still think of her often and I feel blessed to have experienced her friendship and her amazing sense of humor. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>her</b> beautiful smiling face."
