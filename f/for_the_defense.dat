An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E

McClellan's rapid promotion was partly due to his acquaintance with Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary and former Ohio governor and senator.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans {{was a clear}} sign to the {{cautious}} {{citizens of}} Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues.

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
