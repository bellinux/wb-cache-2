5|$|Around this time, {{perhaps because}} of the great and {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo died two years later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, where he left many of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known works.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1938, van Meegeren moved to Nice, using the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} The Supper at Emmaus to buy a 12-bedroom estate at Les Arènes de Cimiez. On the walls of the estate hung several genuine Old Masters. Two of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> forgeries were made here, Interior with Cardplayers and Interior with Drinkers, both displaying the signature of Pieter de Hooch. During his time in Nice, he painted his Last Supper I in the style of Vermeer.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 {{the poet}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge rented the cottage. While he lived there he wrote many of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known works. He was visited by William Wordsworth and other early {{members of the}} Romantic movement. Coleridge moved out in 1799 and the {{building}} was refurbished. Almost 100 years after his occupation some of his admirers leased the property and eventually bought it, after a national campaign and significant private funding. In 1909 they handed {{it over to the}} National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries further renovation and expansion was undertaken, since when it has won awards as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar against <b>his</b> <b>better</b> judgment.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} <b>his</b> <b>better</b> {{understanding of}} terrain {{in every possible}} way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated <b>his</b> <b>better</b> pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E

5|$|The {{books and}} letters written by Bahá'u'lláh cover {{religious}} doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, {{social and moral}} teachings as well as Bahá'í laws; he also wrote many prayers. Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, analyzing Baha'u'llah's writings, states that {{he wrote in the}} different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings. All of his works are considered by Bahá'ís to be revelation, even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim. Some of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known works that have been translated into English include Gleanings, the Hidden Words, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-Íqán.|$|E
5|$|Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams's {{music as}} a {{strongly}} individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk‐song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy. The basis of his work is melody, his rhythms, in Kennedy's view, being unsubtle at times. Vaughan Williams's music {{is often described as}} visionary; Kennedy cites the masque Job and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Vaughan Williams's output was prolific and wide-ranging. For the voice he composed songs, operas, and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses. His comparatively few chamber works are not among <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known compositions. Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation, such as the Serenade to Music (1938) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra; Flos Campi (1925) for solo viola, small orchestra, and small chorus; and his most important chamber work, in Howes's view—not purely instrumental but a song cycle—On Wenlock Edge (1909) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against <b>his</b> <b>better</b> judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E
60|$|Master Courage {{helped him}} to mount, and he rode away in the {{direction}} of the Dover Road, his head bent, his thoughts dwelling in puzzlement and wonder on the strange doings of those whom he still reverently called <b>his</b> <b>betters.</b>|$|R
60|$|Such talents for amusing others evidently far out-weighed in Harold's {{consideration}} such trifling {{points as}} fathers, mothers, and respectability. Alfred laughed; but Ellen thought it no laughing matter, and reproved Harold for being wicked {{enough to hear}} <b>his</b> <b>betters</b> made game of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Hobbie," [...] {{answered}} the young gentleman, [...] "if {{he should be}} so ill advised, I shall {{try to make the}} old tower good against him, as it has been made good by my <b>betters</b> against <b>his</b> <b>betters</b> many a day ago." ...|$|R
5|$|Loxton {{played in}} all five Tests, {{and in the}} First Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, he scored his first Test century. He {{compiled}} 101 in 150 minutes, helping Australia {{to a total of}} 413 after both opening batsmen were out without scoring. Hassett’s men {{went on to win the}} match by an innings. The Second Test was an eight-wicket victory for the Australians, this time dominated by Harvey's 178, with whom Loxton shared a 140-run stand for the fifth wicket, contributing 35 himself. He also took a wicket. The Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban was dramatic; batting first, South Africa made 311 and Hugh Tayfield then took 7/23 as Australia collapsed to 75 all out after the rain and sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket. During the first innings, Hassett changed his batting order so that <b>his</b> <b>better</b> batsmen were low down in the order so that they could bat in better conditions as the pitch stabilised. Loxton batted at No. 10 and Harvey at No. 9, but the Australians collapsed before the pitch had changed measurably. Not enforcing the follow-on, the South Africans batted again and were themselves bowled out for 99, losing their last seven wickets for 14 runs. This left Australia to chase 336 runs for victory, highly unlikely as the last 28 wickets had fallen for only 245. The tourists were still more than 200 runs in arrears when Loxton came in to join Harvey. On Loxton’s first ball, a delivery from Tayfield narrowly missed his edge. He survived to lunch after being caught from a no ball on the long on boundary from a lofted drive. With an unbeaten 151, Harvey took Australia to an improbable five-wicket victory, supported by his fellow Victorian, who scored 54 in a century partnership.|$|E
25|$|Gustavo Cadena {{was born}} in Puebla in 1974 has been a noticed painter {{since he was a}} young child. Many of his works reflect daily life, customs and traditions of the state. Some of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known works include Niño indígena mexicano, Catedral de Puebla, and Pensando en Puebla.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 he was {{a member}} of the Surrey side that won the County Championship for the first time since 1958. However he did not have one of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> seasons, 19 matches brought him only 903 runs {{averaging}} at 26.55, with one century.His number of catches reduced to 14.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{meets the}} first cold {{sprinkle}} {{of the world}} [...] And shudders to the marrow, 'Save this child? [...] Oh, my superiors, oh, the Archbishop here! [...] Who was it dared lay hand upon the ark [...] <b>His</b> <b>betters</b> saw fall nor put finger forth?'" ...|$|R

25|$|Over recent years, {{his work}} has been {{performed}} a little more often both in Russia and abroad, and has often met with positive criticism. Amongst <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known works are the opera The Demon, his Piano Concerto No. 4, and his Symphony No. 2, known as The Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Although George Loddiges' {{arboretum}} {{was widely}} praised, <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known horticultural endeavour {{was to establish}} the world's largest hothouse in his Hackney Botanic Nursery, and invent a system of warm mist-like rain to maintain beautiful tropical palms, ephiphytic orchids, ferns and camellias in almost perfect environmental conditions akin to a 'tropical rainforest'.|$|E
25|$|He was {{selected}} to play against the touring Indian side, being picked over Jim Higgs due {{in part because of}} <b>his</b> <b>better</b> batting. Mann took 3–12 in the first innings of the First Test and also making useful scores of 19 and 26 in a closely fought match. He was less successful in the second innings as a bowler, taking 0–52.|$|E
60|$|Again she frowned: {{the tone}} of gentle mockery had struck unpleasantly on her ear {{and she did not}} like that look of self-satisfied {{independence}} which sat on him as if to the manner born, when he was only an abject menial, paid to do dirty work for <b>his</b> <b>betters.</b>|$|R

25|$|The general electoral {{geography}} did {{not significantly}} change from the first Chirac election. However, Sarkozy received a lesser score in Corrèze, Chirac's home department, and bettered Chirac's score in the North-East, where Le Pen had obtained some of <b>his</b> <b>better</b> scores in 2002. Overall, the increase in votes for Sarkozy between the two rounds occurred mostly in departments where the National Front's presence is strong.|$|E
25|$|Brenna {{never reached}} {{the level of}} <b>his</b> <b>better</b> known contemporaries Giacomo Quarenghi, Charles Cameron and Vasili Bazhenov and was soon surpassed by his own trainee Carlo Rossi. Nevertheless, historians Igor Grabar, Nikolay Lanceray and Dmitry Shvidkovsky praised him for sincere and {{unrestricted}} naturalism of his graphic work and considered {{him to be the}} watershed between the Age of Enlightenment and Romanticism in Russian architecture.|$|E
25|$|According to ten {{verses of}} , John was imprisoned for criticizing King Herod Antipas's {{marriage}} to Herodias, the former wife of Antipas's half-brother Herod II.

60|$|He {{turned to}} Lambert, who a little dazed {{to find himself}} in such {{brilliant}} company, had somewhat timidly kept close to {{the heels of his}} employer.
