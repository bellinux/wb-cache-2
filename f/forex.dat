25|$|The Japanese yen soared against {{most major}} {{currencies}} following the earthquake and reached a post-World War II high of 76.25 yen to the US dollar on speculation that Japanese investors would repatriate assets {{to pay for}} rebuilding.

500|$|... $203 {{million in}} fines is due to UBS's <b>forex</b> {{activities}} breaching a previous deal made with the US over the rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
