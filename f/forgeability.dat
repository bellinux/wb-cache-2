The <b>forgeability</b> of the as cast MMCs were also measured at different section of the casting. The results show that the <b>forgeability</b> of cast metal matrix composites at the middle section of the casting is minimum compared to both end section of a three-step casting.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of predicting the fracture occurrence in forging process chains strongly {{depends on the}} correct choice and calibration of damage and fracture laws under specific stress and strain conditions. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the fracture limits of a brass alloy deformed at elevated temperature under {{a wide range of}} stress states typical of hot forging process chains. A combined use of experimental and numerical techniques allowed determining the material fracture limits. Tensile and torsion tests at elevated temperature were conducted to investigate the influence that the stress triaxiality and the deviatoric parameters may have on the material formability. Numerical simulations of the above cited tests were carried out to calculate the values of the stress triaxiality factor of the tests and to correlate them with the experimentally determined strain at fracture. The CuZn 40 Pb 2 brass alloy was taken as the reference material, being characterized by a restrict <b>forgeability</b> window in current hot forging processes. The obtained results state that the material deformation at fracture is greatly influenced not only by the forging temperature (allowing the determination of the lower temperature limit of the <b>forgeability</b> window), but also by the stress triaxiality and deviatoric parameters, meaning that a general fracture law should be dependent on these stress parameters, besides on the temperature...|$|E

For substantial parts like turbine rotors and discs this means increased requirements on the high temperature resistance, which can not longer be fulfilled by the presently used steel. As new materials for the components, which are thermo-mechanically loaded, only Ni-based superalloys are suitable for their fabrication, structure stability and thermo-mechanical characteristics. With view on creep and creep crack growth resistance as suitable candidates in the context a DFG research project wrought Ni-based superalloy Waspaloy and Ni-Fe-based alloy Inconel 706 were selected, which exhibited different hardening mechanisms. Waspaloy is a Gamma’-hardened material with small portion of carbides on the grain boundaries. Inconel 706 is a particle hardened alloy with a very complex microstructure, it consists of Gamma’, Gamma’’-particle, -phase und carbides. Concerning to their castability, <b>forgeability,</b> creep and creep crack growth and microstructural stability these candidate materials have been investigated and modelled. The knowledge about their long time stability of the microstructure, castability, <b>forgeability</b> and mechanical properties leads to the two new modification (WaspaloyDT 750 and Inconel 706 DT 706).

40|$|Demand for {{lighter and}} stiffer {{products}} {{has been increasing}} {{in the last few}} years especially in automobile manufacturing. The closed die forging process of Metal Matrix Material (MMC) is presented as possible solution, since it produces parts with good mechanical properties and lighter weight. A computational modeling of closed die forging process using finite element method and optimization techniques makes the design optimization faster and more efficient, decreasing the use of conventional trial and error methods. In this study, the application of commercial finite element software (ANSYS) has been used to model cold closed die forging process. The model has been developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) to simulate a single stage axi-symmetry closed die forging process for H cross sectional shape. The material used is AlMgSi matrix with 15 % SiC particles. Its flow curve and fractural strain are obtained from the literature. ANSYS Optimizer is used to obtain the maximum height in which the material can flow in the rib by changing Design Variables (DV) and State Variables (SV). Normally design variables are geometrical parameters such as, rib height to width ratio, web height to rib height ratio, fillet radii, draft angle and billet radius. State Variables (SV) are some parameters that depend on the design variables such as, the equivalent strain which must be below the fracture strain of the MMC material, and an acceptable contact gap (within the allowable tolerances range). Optimization method called Sub-Problem Approximation Method was used to find out the optimal design set. The technique used in this study can be used for newly developed materials to investigate its <b>forgeability</b> for much complicated shapes in closed die forging process...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the premise that ceramics might sometimes profitably be shaped using techniques more traditionally associated with metals and plastics, particularly forging of solids and extrusion of liquids. This firstly required that the high temperature formability of ceramics be known. Existing forming and associated testing techniques were therefore surveyed, establishing short-comings and pointing to areas requiring new techniques. Plastic deformation mechanisms of principal simple ceramics were reviewed to determine the scope of novel techniques required, and to show evidence of suitability for forming. Emphasis {{was given to the}} deformation behaviour of alumina, the ceramic chosen for experimental investigation. Five rigs were constructed for an experimental schedule in three phases: (I) two furnaces and one press were used to study the compatibility of alumina with graphite, tantalum, tungsten and molybdenum under forming conditions. Some original microhardness values for carbides were measured. Observations were made of graphite's spectral emissivity. Sensitive temperature control was achieved. ii) a special melting unit was developed for inflating molten alumina to form hollow spheres, resembling blow-moulding of glass and plastics. Thermal endurances of tungsten heaters in vacuo, in argon and in molten alumina were studied. Heat transfer through sintered and powder alumina was measured. The spectral emissivity of sintered alumina was found. The freezing contraction of molten alumina, and the contact angle with tungsten were found accurately using a novel technique with possible wide application. iii) a multipurpose rig with tungsten tooling was constructed for tests of alternating drivedown - stress relaxation, compressive creep, and forging on recrystallised alumina. The experiments gave information on <b>forgeability,</b> ductility above 1150 C, crack healing, tertiary creep rate, pore distribution effect on steady state creep rate, and pore closing contribution to deformation. It was concluded that forging and liquid extrusion of alumina is feasible and is sometimes preferable to traditional shaping methods...|$|E
40|$|A {{new steel}} with high Cr and low W, Mo {{contents}} for forged cold work roll was designed {{based on the}} composition system of traditional high speed steel (HSS) roll. The Fe-C isopleths of the steel and the mass fraction of equilibrium phases versus temperature were calculated by Thermo–Calc, {{and the effects of}} different alloying elements (W, Mo, Cr, V) on austenite, ferrite and carbides (MC, M 6 C, M 7 C 3, M 23 C 6) were also established to optimize the composition and structure. The designed and optimized specimens were both quenched at 1100 ℃and then tempered twice at 560 ℃. The hardness and wear resistance of the samples were measured. The microstructures of quenched tempered and forged specimens were studied. The results show that ferrite crystallization, peritectic reaction, austenite crystallization and the precipitation of MC, M 6 C, M 7 C 3, M 23 C 6 occur during equilibrium solidification process. The alloying elements W, Mo mainly affect the precipitation of M 6 C, while Cr affects the precipitated region and mass fraction of M 7 C 3. High V content widens the high temperature region of the peritectic reaction and results in a large amount of MC precipitates. The optimized composition (wt%) for cold work roll steel is 1. 30 - 1. 35 %C, 9 - 10 %Cr, 2. 5 - 3. 0 %Mo, 0. 5 - 1. 0 %W, 2. 5 - 3. 0 %V, 0. 5 - 0. 6 %Mn, 0. 5 - 0. 6 %Si. The hardness of the steel after quenching and tempering is 60. 8 HRC and weight loss after 120 min is 6. 2 mg. This meets the requirement of hardness and wear resistance requirements for cold work roll. The ledeburite in the optimized steel disappears after forging and the carbide network break into a large amount of tiny blocky ones dispersed in the matrix without cracks, which shows a good <b>forgeability</b> of the steel and rationality of the optimized composition...|$|E
