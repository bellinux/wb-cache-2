50|$|The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA) {{continue}} to promote improved transparency on tax information and substantial {{progress has been}} made in the past 5 years.

The OECD “grey list” includes countries which have not achieved “white list” status and are considered as fostering tax evasion through insufficient financial openness.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the Internet email {{has become one}} of the primary method of {{communication}} used by everyone for the exchange of ideas and information. However, in recent years, along with the rapid growth of the Internet and email, there has been a dramatic growth in spam. Classifications algorithms have been successfully used to filter spam, but with a certain amount of false positive trade-offs. This problem is mainly caused by the dynamic nature of spam content, spam delivery strategies, as well as the diversification of the classification algorithms. This paper presents an approach of email classification to overcome the burden of analyzing technique of GL (<b>grey</b> <b>list)</b> analyser as further refinements of our previous multi-classifier based email classification [10]. In this approach, we introduce a “majority voting <b>grey</b> <b>list</b> (MVGL) ” analyzing technique with two different variations which will analyze only the product of GL emails.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{technique}} of email classification based on <b>grey</b> <b>list</b> (GL) analysis of user emails. This technique is based on the analysis of output emails of an integrated model which uses multiple classifiers of statistical learning algorithms. The GL is a list of classifier/(s) output which is/are not considered as true positive (TP) and true negative (TN) but in the middle of them. Many works have been done to filter spam from legitimate emails using classification algorithm and substantial performance has been achieved with some amount of false positive (FP) tradeoffs. In the case of spam detection the FP problem is unacceptable, sometimes. The proposed technique will provide a list of output emails, called "grey list (GL) ", to the analyser for making decisions about the status of these emails. It has been shown that the performance of our proposed technique for email classification is much better compare to existing systems, in order to reducing FP problems and accuracy. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The ship {{inspection}} {{system can be}} regarded as a frontline fighting against substandard ships.

The shortcomings are appreciated under the Hierarchical Task Analysis structure. A list of the alternatives for improvement and the priority are accordingly established based on the Value-Focused Thinking and Analytical Hierarchy Process methods. In addition, the training courses capable of creating prompt effects on ship inspection performance for short terms are also proposed. It is believed that the solutions proposed in this paper will enable the government to establish an integrated scheme for ship inspections. I...|$|E
40|$|As legislation, {{research}} {{and management of}} invasive alien species (IAS) are not fully coordinated across countries or different stakeholder groups, one approach leading to more or less standardized activities is based on producing lists of prominent IAS that attain high level of concern and are a subject of priority monitoring and management. These so-called Black, Grey and Watch (alert) Lists represent a convenient starting point for setting priorities in prevention, early warning and management systems. It is important that these lists be based on transparent and robust criteria so as to accommodate interests and perception of impacts by groups of concerned authorities and stakeholders representing sectors as diverse as, e. g. forestry, horticulture, aquaculture, hunting, and nature conservation, and to justify possible trade restrictions. The principles for blacklisting need to be general enough to accommodate differences among taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) and invaded environments (e. g. aquatic, terrestrial, urban, suburban, seminatural), and {{must take into account}} invasion dynamics, the impact the IAS pose, and management strategies suitable for each particular invader. With these assumptions in mind, we synthesize available information to present Black, Grey and Watch Lists of alien species for the Czech Republic, with recommended categorized management measures for land managers, policy makers and other stakeholders. We took into account differences in the listed species' distribution, invasion status, known or estimated environmental impact, as well as possible management options, and apply these criteria to both plants and animals. Species with lower impact, but for which some level of management and regulation is desirable, are included on the <b>Grey</b> <b>List.</b> Some potentially dangerous species occurring in European countries with comparable climatic conditions, as well as those introduced in the past but without presently known wild populations in the Czech Republic, are listed on the Watch list. In total, there are 78 plant and 39 animal species on the Black List, 47 and 16 on the <b>Grey</b> <b>List,</b> and 25 and 27, respectively, on the Watch List. The multilayered approach to the classification of alien species, combining their impacts, population status and relevant management, can {{serve as a model for}} other countries that are in process of developing their Black Lists...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new tax}} measure - the Tax Attractiveness Index - reflecting the attractiveness of a country's tax environment and the tax planning opportunities that are offered. Specifically, the Tax Attractiveness Index covers 16 different components of real-world tax systems, such as the statutory tax rate, the taxation of dividends and capital gains, withholding taxes, {{the existence of a}} group taxation regime, loss offset provision, the double tax treaty network, thin capitalization rules, and controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. We develop methods to quantify each tax factor. The Tax Attractiveness Index is constructed for 100 countries over the 2005 to 2009 period. Regional clusters in the index {{as well as in the}} application of certain tax rules can be observed. The evaluation of individual countries based on the index corresponds - but is not totally identical - with the OECD's black respectively <b>grey</b> <b>list.</b> By comparing the Tax Attractiveness Index with the statutory tax rate, we reveal that even high tax countries offer favorable tax condi-tions. Hence, the statutory tax rate is not a suitable proxy for a country's tax climate in any case since countries may set other incentives to attract firms and investments...|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{clothing}} and textiles for green burial, step 3 {{of the five}} steps to eco-effectiveness, “Creating a ‘passive positive’ list” {{has yet to be}} completed by scholars or this multi-case study’s subjects. Each designer’s work incorporates the intuitive assumption that synthetic fibers and dyes are not eco-effective. However, step 3 calls for the creation of three definitive lists of materials to use and materials to avoid: (1) The X list: substances known to be “the most problematic…teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, or otherwise harmful in direct and obvious ways to human and ecological health”; (2) The grey list: “problematic substances,” those “that are not quite so urgently in need of phaseout,” plus ones “essential for manufacture, and for which we currently have no viable substitutes,” and (3) The P list, the list of “positive” or “preferred” substances, those that are “healthy and safe for use” (p. 174). Ideally, all the steps in the process of manufacturing textiles selected for green burial can be identified, including any chemicals used throughout the supply chain (from fields to finishes), and the textiles can be listed on either the <b>grey</b> <b>list</b> or the P list. This step may seem daunting, but McDonough and Braungart (2002) explain, “…this stage is the beginning of real change, and the inventory process can galvanize real creativity. It may stimulate {{the development of a new}} product line…[and] represents a paradigm shift” (p. 177).|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{enforcement}} procedures available {{in respect of}} a consumer’s right to fair contract terms under the South African Consumer Protection Act ('CPA'), in comparative perspective, particularly {{with reference to the}} UK. The overarching question that is addressed is whether the enforcement procedures {{and other parts of the}} Consumer Protection Act relevant to unfair contract terms reflect an effective, preventative or proactive control paradigm to operate in tandem with reactive or ‘ex post facto’ judicial control over individual contracts. The article is structured as follows. First, a brief overview with preventative control in the UK is provided. Thereafter, several aspects of a system of so-called general use challenges will be considered. General use challenges refers to challenges to contract terms where a public enforcement body or consumer organisation represents the collective interest of all consumers in fair terms, without any individual consumer being named as represented in the court action, and where no harm to individual consumers need be shown. The aspects considered are, first, which agencies are, or should be, empowered to bring general use challenges. The second question considered is whether a public enforcement body is, or should be, obliged to act upon a complaint by applying for an interdict if negotiations with the supplier fail. Thirdly, the powers that should be granted to an enforcement body to facilitate general use challenges are considered, as well as the procedure that ought to be followed. Thereafter the article considers possible court orders for which unfair terms legislation should ideally provide to facilitate preventative control. Fifthly, other parts of the legislation (in addition to the ‘procedural part’) which should be geared towards a preventative control paradigm are identified. This comprises a proposal for the wording of a so-called <b>grey</b> <b>list</b> of contract terms that are presumed to be unfair. Thereafter extra-legislative strategies are examined, especially action on sectoral level and dissemination of information. Finally, the need to provide for regional co-operation is discussed...|$|E
