2500|$|The {{season began}} in Los Angeles when a re-energized Chuck and Nate decided to pay Serena a visit. Chuck has a newfound {{philosophy}} and says [...] "yes" [...] to everything, even death defying stunts. Serena {{continues to work}} on the movie set, and is offered a full-time job {{at the end of the}} episode. Nate begins an affair with an older woman, Diana Payne, who may have an ulterior motive <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> Nate. Back in New York, Dan learns that Vanessa has published one chapter of his novel, and Blair continues to plan her wedding to Louis, and she also learns she is pregnant. After realizing she still had feelings for Chuck, Blair and Chuck decide to go away together, but their car crashes. As a result of the crash Blair loses her baby, Chuck nearly dies, and Blair eventually marries Louis. The season also focuses on Nate running an online gossip site NYSpectator, Blair and Dan's friendship turning into a relationship, Chuck's quest to find his real parents which leads him to discover that his father, Bart, is still alive, and the effects of CeCe's death on Lily and her marriage to Rufus. At the end of the season, Blair makes a choice between Dan and Chuck, and Lily makes a choice between Rufus and Bart. Serena is seen leaving town while Dan decides to write a new book about the Upper East Side, with the help of Georgina.|$|E

60|$|You see {{we are in}} London after all, {{and poor}} Sidmouth left afar. I am almost {{inclined}} to say 'poor us' instead of 'poor Sidmouth.' But I dare say I shall {{soon be able to}} see in my dungeon, and begin to be amused with the spiders. Half my soul, in the meantime, seems to have stayed behind on the seashore, which I love more than ever now that I cannot walk on it in the body. London is wrapped up like a mummy, in a yellow mist, so closely that I have had scarcely a glimpse of its countenance since we came. Well, I am trying to like it all very much, and I dare say that in time I may change my taste and my senses--and succeed. We are in a house large enough to hold us, for four months, {{at the end of which}} time, if the experiment of our being able to live in London succeed, I believe that papa's intention is to take an unfurnished house and have his furniture from Ledbury. You may wonder at me, but I wish that were settled so, and now. I am satisfied with London, although I cannot enjoy it. We are not likely, in the case of leaving it, to return to Devonshire, and I should look with weary eyes to another strangership and pilgrimage even among green fields that know not these fogs. Papa's object in settling here refers to my brothers. George will probably enter as a barrister student at the Inner Temple on the fifth or sixth of this month, and he will have the advantage of his home by our remaining where we are. Another advantage of London is, that we shall see here those whom we might see nowhere else. This year, dear Mrs. Martin, may it bring with it the true pleasure of seeing you! Three have gone, and we have not seen you.... May God bless you and all that you care <b>for,</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> you always as the God of consolation and peace.|$|E

6000|$|I mean (in {{response}} to what you write me of your having read the Golden B.) to try to produce some uncanny form of thing, in fiction, that will gratify you, as Brother--but let me say, dear William, that I shall greatly be humiliated if you do like it, and thereby lump it, in your affection, with things, of the current age, that I have heard you express admiration for and that I would sooner descend to a dishonoured grave than have written. Still I will write you your book, on that two-and-two-make-four system on which all the awful truck that surrounds us is produced, and then descend to my dishonoured grave--taking up {{the art of the}} slate pencil instead of, longer, the art of the brush (vide my lecture on Balzac.) But it is, seriously, too late at night, and I am too tired, for me to express myself on this question--beyond saying that I'm always sorry when I hear of your reading anything of mine, and always hope you won't--you seem to me so constitutionally unable to [...] "enjoy" [...] it, and so condemned to look at it from a point of view remotely alien to mine in writing it, and to the conditions out of which, as mine, it has inevitably sprung--so that all the intentions that have been its main reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> (<b>with</b> me) appear never to have reached you at all--and you appear even to assume that the life, the elements forming its subject-matter, deviate from felicity in not having an impossible analogy with the life of Cambridge. I see nowhere about me done or dreamed of the things that alone for me constitute the interest of the doing of the novel--and yet it is in a sacrifice of them on their very own ground that the thing you suggest to me evidently consists. It shows how far apart and to what different ends we have had to work out (very naturally and properly!) our respective intellectual lives. And yet I can read you with rapture--having three weeks ago spent three or four days with Manton Marble at Brighton and found in his hands ever so many of your recent papers and discourses, which, having margin of mornings in my room, through both breakfasting and lunching there (by the habit of the house,) I found time to read several of--with the effect of asking you, earnestly, to address me some of those that I so often, in Irving St., saw you address to others who were not your brother. I had no time to read them there. Philosophically, in short, I am [...] "with" [...] you, almost completely, and you ought to take account of this and get me over altogether.--There are two books by the way (one fictive) that I permit you to raffoler about as much as you like, for I have been doing so myself--H. G. Wells's Utopia and his Kipps. The Utopia seems to me even more remarkable for other things than for his characteristic cheek, and Kipps is quite magnificent. Read them both if you haven't--certainly read Kipps.--There's also another subject I'm too full of not to mention the good thing I've done for myself--that is, for Lamb House and my garden--by moving the greenhouse away from the high old wall near the house (into the back garden, setting it up better--against the street wall) and thereby throwing the liberated space into the front garden to its immense apparent extension and beautification....|$|E
6000|$|It is made {{known to}} me that they are soon to feast in New York the newest and freshest of the splendid birthdays to which you keep {{treating}} us, and that your many friends will meet round you to rejoice in it and reaffirm their allegiance. I shall not be there, to my sorrow, and though this is inevitable I yet want to be missed, peculiarly and monstrously missed; so that these words shall be a public apology for my absence: read by you, if you like and can stand it, but better still read to you and in fact straight at you, by whoever will be so kind and so loud and so distinct. For I doubt, you see, whether any of your toasters and acclaimers have anything like my ground and title <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> you at such an hour. There can scarce be one, I think, to-day, who has known you from so far back, who has kept so close to you for so long, and who has such fine old reasons--so old, yet so well preserved--to feel your virtue and sound your praise. My debt to you began well-nigh half a century ago, in the most personal way possible, and then kept growing and growing with your own admirable growth--but always rooted in the early intimate benefit. This benefit was that you held out your open editorial hand to me at the time I began to write--and I allude especially to the summer of 1866--with a frankness and sweetness of hospitality that was really the making of me, the making of the confidence that required help and sympathy and that I should otherwise, I think, have strayed and stumbled about a long time without acquiring. You showed me the way and opened me the door; you wrote to me, and confessed yourself struck with me--I have never forgotten the beautiful thrill of that. You published me at once--and paid me, above all, with a dazzling promptitude; magnificently, I felt, and so that nothing since has ever quite come up to it. More than this even, you cheered me on with a sympathy that was in itself an inspiration. I mean that you talked to me and listened to me--ever so patiently and genially and suggestively conversed and consorted with me. This won me to you irresistibly and made you the most interesting person I knew--lost as I was in the charming sense that my best friend was an editor, and an almost insatiable editor, and that such a delicious being as that was a kind of property of my own. Yet how didn't that interest still quicken and spread when I became aware that--with such attention as you could spare from us, for I recognised my fellow beneficiaries--you had started to cultivate your great garden as well; the tract of virgin soil that, beginning as a cluster of bright, fresh, sunny and savoury patches, close about the house, as it were, was to become that vast goodly pleasaunce of art and observation, of appreciation and creation, in which you have laboured, without a break or a lapse, to this day, and in which you have grown so grand a show of--well, really of everything. Your liberal visits to my plot, and your free-handed purchases there, were still greater events when I began to see you handle, yourself, with such ease the key to our rich and inexhaustible mystery. Then the question of what you would make of your own powers began to be even more interesting than the question of what you would make of mine--all the more, I confess, as you had ended by settling this one so happily. My confidence in myself, which you had so helped me to, gave way to a fascinated impression of your own spread and growth; for you broke out so insistently and variously that it was a charm to watch and an excitement to follow you. The only drawback that I remember suffering from was that I, your original debtor, couldn't print or publish or pay you--which would have been a sort of ideal repayment and of enhanced credit; you could take care of yourself so beautifully, and I could (unless by some occasional happy chance or rare favour) scarce so much as glance at your proofs or have a glimpse of your [...] "endings." [...] I could only read you, full-blown and finished--and see, {{with the rest of the}} world, how you were doing it again and again.|$|E
6000|$|SCENE II.--A Garden behind LOVELESS'S Lodgings. Enter LOVELESS and SERVANT. Love. Is my wife within? Ser. No, sir, she {{has gone}} out this half-hour. Love. Well, leave me.--[Exit SERVANT.] How strangely does my mind run on this widow!--Never was my heart so {{suddenly}} seized on before. That my wife should pick out her, of all womankind, to be her playfellow! But what fate does, let fate answer for: I sought it not. So! by Heavens! here she comes. Enter BERINTHIA. Ber. What makes you look so thoughtful, sir? I hope you are not ill. Love. I was debating, madam, whether I was so or not, {{and that was it}} which made me look so thoughtful. Ber. Is it then so hard a matter to decide? I thought all people were acquainted with their own bodies, though few people know their own minds. Love. What if the distemper I suspect be in the mind? Ber. Why then I'll undertake to prescribe you a cure. Love. Alas! you undertake you know not what. Ber. So far at least, then, you allow me to be a physician. Love. Nay, I'll allow you to be so yet further: for I have reason to believe, should I put myself into your hands, you would increase my distemper. Ber. How? Love. Oh, you might betray me to my wife. Ber. And so lose all my practice. Love. Will you then keep my secret? Ber. I will. Love. Well--but swear it. Ber. I swear by woman. Love. Nay, that's swearing by my deity; swear by your own, and I shall believe you. Ber. Well then, I swear by man! Love. I'm satisfied. Now hear my symptoms, and give me your advice. The first were these; when I saw you at the play, a random glance you threw at first alarmed me. I could not turn my eyes from whence the danger came--I gazed upon you till my heart began to pant--nay, even now, on your approaching me, my illness is so increased that if you do not help me I shall, whilst you look on, consume to ashes. [Takes her hand.] Ber. O Lord, let me go! 'tis the plague, and we shall be infected. [Breaking from him.] Love. Then we'll die together, my charming angel. Ber. O Gad! the devil's in you! Lord, let me go!--here's somebody coming. Re-enter SERVANT. Ser. Sir, my lady's come home, and desires to speak with you. Love. Tell her I'm coming.--[Exit SERVANT.] But before I go, one glass of nectar to drink her health. [To BERINTHIA.] Ber. Stand off, or I shall hate you, by Heavens! Love. [Kissing her.] In matters of love, a woman's oath is no more to be minded than a man's. [Exit.] Ber. Um! Enter COLONEL TOWNLY. Col. Town. [Aside.] So? what's here--Berinthia and Loveless--and in such close conversation!--I cannot now wonder at her indifference in excusing herself to me!--O rare woman!--Well then, let Loveless look to his wife, 'twill be but the retort courteous on both sides.--[Aloud.] Your servant, madam; I need not ask you how you do, you have got so good a colour. Ber. No better than I used to have, I suppose. Col. Town. A little more blood in your cheeks. Ber. I have been walking! Col. Town. Is that all? Pray was it Mr. Loveless went from here just now? Ber. O yes--he has been walking with me. Col. Town. He has! Ber. Upon my word I think he is a very agreeable man; and there is certainly something particularly insinuating in his address. Col. Town. [Aside.] So, so! she hasn't even the modesty to dissemble! [Aloud.] Pray, madam, may I, without impertinence, trouble you with a few serious questions? Ber. As many as you please; but pray let them be as little serious as possible. Col. Town. Is it not near two years since I have presumed to address you? Ber. I don't know exactly--but it has been a tedious long time. Col. Town. Have I not, during that period, had {{every reason to believe that}} my assiduities were far from being unacceptable? Ber. Why, to do you justice, you have been extremely troublesome--and I confess I have been more civil to you than you deserved. Col. Town. Did I not come to this place at your express desire, and for no purpose but the honour of meeting you?--and after waiting a month in disappointment, have you condescended to explain, or in the slightest way apologise for, your conduct? Ber. O heavens! apologise for my conduct!--apologise to you! O you barbarian! But pray now, my good serious colonel, have you anything more to add? Col. Town. Nothing, madam, but that after such behaviour I am less surprised at what I saw just now; it is not very wonderful that the woman who can trifle with the delicate addresses of an honourable lover should be found coquetting with the husband of her friend. Ber. Very true: no more wonderful than it was for this honourable lover to divert himself in the absence of this coquette, with endeavouring to seduce his friend's wife! O colonel, colonel, don't talk of honour or your friend, for Heaven's sake! Col. Town. [Aside.] 'Sdeath! how came she to suspect this!--[Aloud.] Really, madam, I don't understand you. Ber. Nay, nay, you saw I did not pretend to misunderstand you.--But here comes the lady; perhaps you would be glad to be left with her for an explanation. Col. Town. O madam, this recrimination is a poor resource; and to convince you how much you are mistaken, I beg leave to decline the happiness you propose me.--Madam, your servant. Enter AMANDA. COLONEL TOWNLY whispers AMANDA, and exit. Ber. [Aside.] He carries it off well, however; upon my word, very well! How tenderly they part!--[Aloud] So, cousin; I hope you have not been chiding your admirer <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> me? I assure you we have been talking of you. Aman. Fy, Berinthia!--my admirer! will you never learn to talk in earnest of anything? Ber. Why this shall be in earnest, if you please; for my part, I only tell you matter of fact. Aman. I'm sure there's so much jest and earnest in what you say to me on this subject, I scarce know how to take it. I have just parted with Mr. Loveless; perhaps it is fancy, but I think there is an alteration in his manner which alarms me. Ber. And so you are jealous; is that all? Aman. That all! is jealousy, then, nothing? Ber. It should be nothing, if I were in your case. Aman. Why, what would you do? Ber. I'd cure myself. Aman. How? Ber. Care as little for my husband as he did for me. Look you, Amanda, you may build castles in the air, and fume, and fret, and grow thin, and lean, and pale, and ugly, if you please; but I tell you, no man worth having is true to his wife, or ever was, or ever will be so. Aman. Do you then really think he's false to me? for I did not suspect him. Ber. Think so? I am sure of it. Aman. You are sure on't? Ber. Positively--he fell in love at the play. Aman. Right--the very same. But who could have told you this? Ber. Um!--Oh, Townly! I suppose your husband has made him his confidant. Aman. O base Loveless! And what did Townly say on't? Ber. [Aside.] So, so! why should she ask that?-- [Aloud.] Say! why he abused Loveless extremely, and said all the tender things of you in the world. Aman. Did he?--Oh! my heart!--I'm very ill--dear Berinthia, don't leave me a moment. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
