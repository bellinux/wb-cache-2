5|$|Christopher Báthory fell {{seriously ill}} after his wife's death. At his request, the Diet of Transylvania elected Sigismund voivode in Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca in Romania) around 15May 1581. Since Sigismund {{was still a}} minor, <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> father tasked a council of twelve noblemen with the government. Christopher Báthory's cousin, Dénes Csáky, and his brother-in-law, Stephen Bocskai, headed the council. Christopher Báthory died on 27May.|$|E
5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious Cloud hidden away, Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. Cloud manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had done to him. Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|The {{final years}} of Alexios's reign were marked by {{persecution}} of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies—one of his last acts was to burn at the stake the Bogomil leader, Basil the Physician, {{with whom he had}} engaged in a theological controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks (1110–1117); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband Nikephorus Bryennios, for whose benefit the special title panhypersebastos ("honored above all") was created. This intrigue disturbed even <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> hours.|$|E

5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association of him with his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} turned against him and organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E
5|$|In 1087, William was fatally injured {{during a}} {{campaign}} in the Vexin. Henry joined <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> father near Rouen in September, where the King partitioned his possessions among his sons. The rules of succession in western Europe {{at the time were}} uncertain; in some parts of France, primogeniture, in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was growing in popularity. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Shaw {{was chosen}} for the small but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> father. Since the scene was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg left Hawaii on June 7, 1887, booking {{steerage}} class {{passage on}} the steamer Australia. Some reports state {{that he left}} owing to health issues, although others suggest that Rosenberg departed the island because {{he was concerned about}} political unrest. He left three weeks before the king signed the June Constitution. Rosenberg returned to San Francisco, but was hospitalized within a month of his return, and died on July 10, 1887. He spoke of King Kalākaua on his deathbed, whispering the king's name with <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> breath. He was buried at the cemetery of Congregation Sherith Israel in the San Francisco Peninsula; brief death notices were published in Hawaii- and San Francisco-based newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The {{passengers}} were Casis Said Atalah, a Palestinian {{returning home to}} Chile from a visit to <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> mother; Jack Gooderham and Harald Pagh, businessmen; Peter Young, an agent for Dunlop; Paul Simpson, a British civil servant; and Marta Limpert, a Chilean resident of German origin who had been stranded in Germany during the war along with her husband. Atalah {{is said to have}} had a diamond with him (stitched into the lining of his suit), Limpert was bringing her dead husband's ashes with her, and Simpson was functioning as a King's Messenger with diplomatic documents destined for the British embassy in Santiago.|$|E

5|$|Through his confession, Cobb makes {{peace with}} his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's {{projection}} and wakes Fischer {{up with a}} kick. Revived at the mountain hospital, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake {{on the plane and}} Saito makes a phone call.|$|E
5|$|Alexei Stukov was {{the vice}} admiral and second-in-command of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force. He first appears in Brood War, voiced by Cástulo Guerra; he later reappears {{as one of}} Kerrigan's lieutenants in the Zerg Swarm in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, voiced by Victor Brandt. A man of Russian descent, his {{military}} career primarily revolves around secret research, though he is also noted as an excellent tactician. A close friend of DuGalle, Stukov will debate situations with the admiral but will subordinate himself to his friend's higher rank. Stukov becomes suspicious of the motives of Samir Duran after the latter convinces DuGalle to destroy the psi disruptor. Believing the device to be the UED's best hope to conquer the Zerg, Stukov instead takes the psi disruptor to Braxis but is tracked down and shot dead by Duran. With <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> breaths, Stukov convinces DuGalle that Duran is a traitor {{and to keep the}} psi disruptor running for the UED's assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char. Stukov's body is given a full funeral and UED propaganda portrays Stukov as a hero, claiming he died in combat on Char.|$|E
5|$|Seeking vengeance for Kureha's death, Ryu learns from Murai {{that the}} raiders were from Vigoor, so he stows away on an airship {{bound for the}} empire. Fighting {{his way through the}} streets of its capital city, Tairon, Ryu faces several bosses {{including}} the three Greater Fiends. He defeats Alma in a battle that wrecks the city, but leaves her to Rachel's mercy. Conversely, Rachel cannot bring herself to kill her sister, and instead is taken by Doku, who prepares to sacrifice her in a ritual to enhance Alma's power. With Alma's help Ryu rescues Rachel and destroys Doku's spirit, but with <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> breath Doku casts the blood curse on Ryu. The only way for Ryu to lift the curse is to kill the emperor, so he storms the palace, defeating Marbus who bars his way to the emperor's personal realm. Two successive boss fights must be completed to destroy the Emperor and reclaim the Dark Dragon Blade—once this is accomplished his realm starts to destruct. Ryu must then be maneuvered up a series of ledges to escape, but in the process he loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} alluded to in William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 (1595). The end of Act V, scene one depicts {{the events leading}} up to the battle; scenes two and three portray the conclusion, in which the {{characters}} discuss the combat and the fates of its participants. Shakespeare uses few details reported by contemporary chroniclers and ignores notable incidents, such as the confusion over Oxford's and Edward's badges. His play is based mostly on poetic and dramatic sources. In the play, Montagu is killed while trying to save his brother (Shakespeare's source material included Hall's 1548 The Union of the Two Noble and Illustrate Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke), and Warwick is dragged in by Edward IV and left to speak <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> words to Oxford and Somerset. Warwick's death dominates the scenes, reflecting Hall's vivid portrayal of the earl's passing as a valiant death. Furthermore, whereas several chronicles mention Edward's desire to capture Warwick, Shakespeare has the Yorkist king lustily demand Warwick's skin.|$|E
5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind the scenes to ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it to scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to <b>his</b> <b>dying</b> brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, {{but it is clear that}} his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E
