40|$|Panicle {{development}} {{is an important}} agronomic trait that aids in <b>determining</b> <b>crop</b> <b>productivity.</b> Foxtail millet and its wild ancestor green foxtail have recently been used as model systems to dissect gene functions. Here, we characterized a recessive mutant of foxtail millet, loose-panicle 1 (lp 1), which showed pleiotropic phenotypes, such as a lax primary branching pattern, aberrant branch morphology, semi-dwarfism, and enlarged seed size. The loose panicle phenotype was attributed to increased panicle lengths and decreased primary branch numbers. Map-based cloning, combined with high-throughput sequencing, revealed that LP 1, which encodes a novel WRKY transcription factor, {{is responsible for the}} mutant phenotype. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that LP 1 belongs to the Group I WRKY subfamily, which possesses two WRKY domains (WRKY I and II). A single G-to-A transition in the fifth intron of LP 1 resulted in three disorganized splicing events in mutant plants. For each of these aberrant splice variants, the normal C 2 H 2 motif in the WRKY II domain was completely disrupted, resulting in a loss-of-function mutation. LP 1 mRNA was expressed in all of the tissues examined, with higher expression levels observed in inflorescences, roots, and seeds at the grain-filling stage. A subcellular localization analysis showed that LP 1 predominantly accumulated in the nucleus, which confirmed its role as a transcriptional regulator. This study provides novel insights into the roles of WRKY proteins in regulating reproductive organ development in plants and may help to develop molecular markers associated with crop yields...|$|E
40|$|Maturity group (based on {{the number}} of days to maturity) is an {{important}} growth trait for <b>determining</b> <b>crop</b> <b>productivity,</b> but there has been no attempt {{to examine the effects of}} elevated [CO 2] on yield enhancement of rice cultivars with different maturity groups. Since early-maturing cultivars generally show higher plant N concentration than late-maturing cultivars, it is hypothesized that [CO 2]-induced yield enhancement might be larger for early-maturing cultivars than late-maturing cultivars. To test this hypothesis, the effects of elevated [CO 2] on yield components, biomass, N uptake, and leaf photosynthesis of cultivars with different maturity groups were examined for 2 years using a free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE). Elevated [CO 2] significantly increased grain yield and the magnitude significantly differed among the cultivars as detected by a significant [CO 2]×cultivar interaction. Two cultivars (one with early and one with late maturity) responded more strongly to elevated [CO 2] than those with intermediate maturity, resulting mainly from increases in spikelet density. Biomass and N uptake at the heading stage were closely correlated with grain yield and spikelet density over [CO 2] and cultivars. Our 2 year field trial rejected the hypothesis that earlier cultivars would respond more to elevated [CO 2] than later cultivars, but it is revealed that the magnitude of the growth enhancement before heading is a useful criterion for selecting rice cultivars capable of adapting to elevated [CO 2]...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{establishment}} {{is a major}} factor <b>determining</b> <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> in the field and is strongly controlled by soil temperature and soil moisture. Fast leaf expansion and dry matter accumulation during crop establishment are required for an adequate establishment. Leaf area expansion and accumulation of dry matter during the establishment of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.) were studied at different soil temperatures and soil moisture contents in a Vertisol (Lisboa) and a Luvisol (Évora) from November 1993 to November 1996. Soil temperature was measured at 2 and 4 cm depth with thermocouples, air temperature was measured with a ventilated psychrometer and soil moisture was measured using the gravimetric method. Leaf area was estimated non-destructively. Above ground seedling dry matter was weighed after oven drying at 65 ºC. Data analysis was based on the thermal time concept. For each crop {{no significant differences were found}} on leaf area at establishment in both soils under favourable water conditions, but significant differences were found on seedling dry matter. In moist soils, leaf area of both species increased linearly with accumulated temperature and dry matter increased exponentially with accumulated temperature. Low soil water during establishment reduced leaf expansion and dry matter accumulation of both crops, mainly if it occurred before seedling emergence. In mediterranean type climates meteorological extremes of low rainfall associated to high temperatures are expected to be more frequent on the wake of global climate change, reducing crop establishment and productivity...|$|E

40|$|Lateral root {{formation}} {{is a critical}} agronomic trait in plant architecture that <b>determines</b> <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> and environmental stress adaptability. It is therefore tightly regulated both by intrinsic developmental cues, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin, and by diverse environmental growth conditions, including water deficit and high salinity in the soil. We have recently reported that an Arabidopsis R 2 R 3 -type MYB transcription factor, MYB 96, regulates lateral root meristem activation under drought conditions via an ABA-auxin signaling crosstalk. In this signaling scheme, the MYB 96 -mediated ABA signals are incorporated into an auxin signaling pathway that involves a subset of GH 3 gene encoding auxin-conjugating enzymes. The MYB 96 -overexpressing, activation tagging mutant, which is featured by having dwarfed growth and reduced lateral root formation, exhibits an enhanced drought resistance. In the mutant, expression of the GH 3 genes was significantly elevated, {{which is consistent with}} the reduced lateral root formation. In contrast, the MYB 96 -deficient knockout mutant produced more lateral roots and was more susceptible to drought stress. Our observations strongly support that MYB 96 is a molecular link that integrates ABA and auxin signals in modulating auxin homeostasis during lateral root development, particularly under water deficit conditions. It is also envisioned that the MYB 96 -mediated signals are related with pathogen resistance response, which is also profoundly affected by water content in plant cells...|$|R

40|$|Water {{quality and}} water supply are {{essential}} for organic greenhouse grown crops to prevent soil contaminationby undesirable chemicals and microorganisms, while providing a sufficient amount of water for plant growth. The absence of natural precipitation combined with higher evapotranspiration due to higher temperatureand longer cropping period requires an adequate supply of water. Water quality is commonly defined by itschemical, physical, and biological attributes. It is {{closely linked to the}} soil/rock native components, surroundingenvironment and land use. The runoff from urban, industrial, farming, mining, and forestry activities alsosignificantly affects the quality of water available for greenhouse horticulture. High water quality is particularlyimportant in organic greenhouse production in order to prevent soil salinization and ensure optimal soil biologicalactivity. Indeed, unbalanced organic fertilizer inputs may contribute to soil salinity, while soil microbial activitiesresponsible for nutrient mineralization, soil suppressiveness and plant health, are affected by soil pH, ions, andcontaminants. Poor water quality can also result in drip and micro irrigation clogging, plant toxicity, and productcontamination by human pathogen or illicit compounds. To achieve sustainable water management, good knowledge of crops' water requirements is essential as isknowledge of the soil water characteristics that determine the irrigation scheduling. Moreover, the adequacyof the irrigation distribution system determines the accuracy of the water supplied. Crop water needs areoften determined on the basis of daily evapotranspiration and solar radiation levels. Different irrigation controltools such as soil moisture sensors, plant sensors, lysimeters and models contribute to the optimization of theirrigation management of organic greenhouse crops. In addition to <b>determining</b> <b>crop</b> <b>productivity,</b> water qualityand water management also impact on product quality. In this booklet we first illustrate the water flows through different organic greenhouse growing systems. Westate the importance of water quality for organic greenhouse horticulture and give some guidelines regardingthe required water quality attributes in terms of inorganic, organic and microbial loads as well as hazardousmicroorganisms and compounds. We also define advantages and disadvantages of different water resourcesand describe the important drivers for crop and soil water demand. We then report the effects of salinity on soilmineralisation and crop development in organic greenhouse production systems. The main irrigation technologyused for organic greenhouse horticulture is described along with the most important management aspects forirrigation. Because quality attributes of greenhouse products drive consumer demand for organic products, wedefine the impact of water quality and irrigation management on product quality. Organic farming should usecultural practices that maintain land resources and ecological balance, in addition to promoting biodiversity,biological cycles, and soil biological activity. We therefore state the importance of water resources and their usefor organic greenhouse system sustainability. We then conclude by summarizing main aspects of water qualityand irrigation management, and by identifying knowledge gaps. Better prediction of the temporal dynamics of plant and soil microbial water needs in relation to sustainableproductivity and high water use efficiency is needed for greenhouse horticultural crops. It is also importantin terms of reduced attractiveness to pests and susceptibility to diseases. A reduction in spatial and temporalcrop heterogeneity should result from improved growing systems and better water and crop management. Nevertheless, advances in irrigation management for conventional greenhouse crops and development of newcontrol tools can be adapted for use in organic greenhouse horticulture. Similarly, some water treatmentsof drained or collected waters such as thermal, UV, ozone and biological treatments can be used by growersaccording to their organic regulation. Consequently, research is needed in different areas of organic greenhousehorticulture: (i) water quality in terms of relevant thresholds for contaminants and potential risks related toplant and human pathogens; (ii) efficient measures to prevent clogging of the irrigation systems; (iii) alternativewater treatments and system cleaning products; (iv) better knowledge and guidelines for non-leaching systems;(v) affordable and highly efficient control tools to assist growers; and (vi) knowledge about the environmentalimpact of different water management and water sources used for organic greenhouse horticulture to helpgrowers fulfilling the organic principles and improve their sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Climbing bean {{is the key}} staple legume crop in the {{highlands}} of East and Central Africa. We assessed the impact of interactions between soil fertility characteristics, crop management and socio-economic factors, such as household resource endowment and gender of the farmer, on climbing bean productivity and yield responses to basal P fertiliser in northern Rwanda. Through a combination of detailed characterisations of 12 farms and on-farm demonstration trials at 110 sites, we evaluated variability in grain yields and responses to fertiliser. Grain yields varied between 0. 14 and 6. 9 t ha− 1 with an overall average of 1. 69 t ha− 1. Household resource endowment and gender of the farmer was strongly associated with climbing bean yield, even though these were partly confounded with Sector. Poorer households and women farmers achieved lower yields than wealthier households and male farmers. Household resource endowment and gender were likely to act as proxies {{for a range of}} agronomic and crop management factors that <b>determine</b> <b>crop</b> <b>productivity,</b> such as soil fertility, current and past access to organic manure and mineral fertiliser, access to sufficient quality staking material, ability to conduct crop management operation on time, but we found evidence for only some of these relationships. Poorer households and female farmers grew beans on soils with poorer soil fertility. Moreover, poorer households had a lower density of stakes, while stake density was strongly correlated with yield. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser application led to a substantial increase in the average grain yield (0. 66 t ha− 1), but a large variability in responses implied that its use would be economically worthwhile for roughly half of the farmers. For the sake of targeting agricultural innovations to those households that are most likely to adopt, the Ubudehe household typology – a Rwandan government system of wealth categorisation – could be a useful and easily available tool to structure rural households within regions of Rwanda that are relatively uniform in agro-ecology.

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the indirect effect of farming practices on yield through a change of the weed pressure and, thereby, disentangle the effect of farming practices on yield and weeds. Between 2006 and 2012 in Burgundy, France, 152 winter wheat fields were surveyed for weeds and farmers were interviewed about their farming practices and yields. Data were analysed using partial least square path modelling (PLS-PM). A path model that related farming intensity (fallow management, sowing, chemical pest control and fertilization), <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> (yield), and weed pressure was designed and validated. It was then used to assess the relationships between the identified variables (beta path coefficients) and compare groups of fields varying in, the preceding crop, herbicide use and weed pressure in the field. Farming intensity had a positive effect on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> (beta = 0. 32). Weed pressure negatively impacted <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> (beta = - 0. 12). Farming intensity decreased weed pressure and had a sufficiently negative effect on weeds (beta = - 0. 19) to counteract the negative impact of weeds on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity.</b> Therefore, the indirect effect of farming intensity on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> through a change of weed pressure was positive and accounted for 7 % of the total (direct + indirect) effect of farming intensity on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity.</b> The indirect effect of farming intensity on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> varied by preceding crop (3. 6 % and 23 % with a winter and spring/summer preceding crop, respectively) and herbicide use (14. 1 % and 2. 1 % when herbicide use was less and more than the regional reference, respectively) and weed pressure (0. 5 % and 2. 6 % when the total weed abundance after weeding was less and more than 2 individuals m(- 2), respectively).

The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of biochar soil amendment (BSA) on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> and to analyze the dependence of responses on experimental conditions. Methods: A weighted meta-analysis was conducted based on data from 103 studies published up to April, 2013. The effect of BSA on <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> was quantified by characterizing experimental conditions. Results: In the published experiments, with biochar amendment rates generally < 30 t ha- 1, BSA increased <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> by 11. 0 % on average, while the responses varied with experimental conditions. Greater responses were found in pot experiments than in field, in acid than in neutral soils, in sandy textured than in loam and silt soils. Crop response in field experiments was greater for dry land crops (10. 6 % on average) than for paddy rice (5. 6 % on average). This result, associated with the higher response in acid and sandy textured soils, suggests both a liming and an aggregating/moistening effect of BSA. Conclusions: The analysis suggests a promising role for BSA in improving <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> especially for dry land crops, and in acid, poor-structured soils though there was wide variation with soil, crop and biochar properties.
