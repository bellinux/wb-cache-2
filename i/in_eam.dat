40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the quantity of timber and extent of illegal timber harvesting in Eastern Arc Mountains. Data were collected using three techniques: desktop review which was used to collect information on timber stocks from two studies <b>in</b> <b>EAMs</b> while socio-economic and ecological surveys were employed to collect information on timber disturbances and timber stocks harvested illegally in NFR. Data analysis involved use of Microsoft excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). A t-test analysis showed that, the EAMs have high potential in terms of timber tree stocks (p (t) = 0. 047 d. f = 39) for stems per ha and (p (t) = 0. 001 d. f = 39) for volume per ha). Also linear regression analysis showed that, extraction of timber trees in NFR mostly occurs illegally at the roadside (R 2 = 0. 19, p = 0. 015). A total of 135 600 000 stems and 74 400 000 m 3 (an equivalent of 0. 6 m 3 per tree) composed of 180 different timber species were identified <b>in</b> <b>EAMs.</b> The major timber species contributed 47 000 000 m 3 (63 %) of total wood volume. Taking the royalty and volume of each timber classes for indigenous and exotic species, the value of timber <b>in</b> <b>EAMs</b> was USD 5576 million. The harvestable timber was about USD 4461 million for trees sizes of greater than 40 cm DBH.

40|$|Background/Aims: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), {{acting as}} a newly found ‘danger-associated {{molecular}} patterns’ (DAMPs), is released into circulation upon tissue injury and performs as a considerable activator of inflammation and immune response. However, the role of circulating mtDNA in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) as well as Toll like receptor 4 (TLR 4) mediated cardiac inflammation and injury remains unknown. Methods: A model of EAM was established in BALB/c mice by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate TLR 4 activation <b>in</b> <b>EAM</b> mice and H 9 C 2 cells. Results: LPS stimulation significantly aggravated cardiac inflammation and tissue injury <b>in</b> <b>EAM,</b> as demonstrated by increased myocardium inflammatory cell infiltration, and up-regulated inflammatory cytokines and troponin I(TnI) level in serum. Circulating mtDNA level was increased <b>in</b> <b>EAM</b> and TLR 4 activation led to a greater elevation, which {{may be related to}} Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress involved mtDNA damage characterized by reduced mtDNA copy number in myocardium tissue. In addition, the expression of Toll like receptor 9 (TLR 9), a ligand of mtDNA, was significantly up-regulated in the myocardium of EAM and EAM LPS group; meanwhile, TLR 9 inhibition by ODN 2088 caused an inhibited apoptosis in LPS treated H 9 C 2 cells. Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>EAM</b> and EAM LPS group, simultaneously giving ODN 2088 treatment significantly ameliorated cardiac inflammation and tissue injury compared with untreated group.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} thermal {{effects in}} widely tunable laser transmitters {{based on an}} integrated single chip design. The chip contains a sampled-grating distributed Bragg reflector (SG-DBR) laser monolithically integrated with a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and an electroabsorption modulator (EAM). The thermal impedance of the ridge structure is evaluated through simulation and experiment, and thermal crosstalk between sections is examined. Heating of the mirrors by neighboring sections is found to result in unintentional offsets in wavelength tuning. Thermal effects <b>in</b> the <b>EAM</b> are examined <b>in</b> depth. A positive feedback mechanism causes local temperature rise at the modulator input, {{with the potential to}} trigger catastrophic thermal runaway.

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, the nano-machining {{process is}} used to produce high quality {{finished}} surfaces with precise form accuracy. To understand and analyze the chip formation mechanism of nano-machining process on an atomistic scale, since the experimentation {{is not an easy}} task, numerical simulation such as molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is a very useful method. In this paper, MD simulation of the nano-metric cutting of single-crystal copper was performed with a single crystal diamond tool. The model was solved with both pair wise Morse potential function and embedded atom method (EAM) potential to simulate the inter-atomic force between the work-piece and a rigid tool. The chip formation mechanism, dislocation generation, tool forces and generated temperature were investigated. Results show that the Morse potential cannot perform an appropriate defect formation and plastic deformation in nano-metric cutting of metals. Also, tool forces in Morse potential are more than the forces <b>in</b> <b>EAM</b> potential. Furthermore, the fluctuations of resultant forces in Morse potential are greater than that of EAM. In addition, using many-body interaction potentials like EAM can lead to substantial changes in surface energies, elastic-plastic properties and atomic displacement, compared with the pair-wise potentials like Morse. Finally, the atomic displacement investigation shows that <b>in</b> <b>EAM</b> potential study, only the atoms in a local region near the cutting process are displaced, but in Morse potential a large portion of atoms has affected during cutting process.

Its specific role in the progression of myocarditis into end stage heart failure is not known.

In the presence of GM-CSF, inflammatory CD 133 (+) progenitors up-regulated integrin, alpha X (CD 11 c), class II major histocompatibility complex, CD 80 and CD 86 co-stimulatory molecules reflecting an inflammatory dendritic cell (DC) phenotype. Inflammatory DCs stimulated antigen-specific CD 4 (+) T cell proliferation and induced myocarditis after myosin peptide loading and adoptive transfer in healthy mice. Moreover, GM-CSF treatment of mice after the peak of disease, between days 21 - 29 of EAM, transiently increased accumulation of inflammatory DCs in the myocardium.

40|$|Aims Experimental {{autoimmune}} myocarditis (EAM) model mirrors important {{mechanisms of}} inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM). <b>In</b> <b>EAM,</b> inflammatory CD 133 + progenitors {{are a major}} cellular source of cardiac myofibroblasts in the post-inflammatory myocardium. We hypothesized that exogenous delivery of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) can stimulate macrophage lineage differentiation of inflammatory progenitors and, therefore, prevent their naturally occurring myofibroblast fate <b>in</b> <b>EAM.</b> Methods and results EAM was induced in wild-type (BALB/c) and nitric oxide synthase 2 -deficient (Nos 2 −/−) mice and CD 133 + progenitors were isolated from inflamed hearts. In vitro, M-CSF converted inflammatory CD 133 + progenitors into nitric oxide-producing F 4 / 80 + macrophages and prevented transforming growth factor-β-mediated myofibroblast differentiation. Importantly, only a subset of heart-infiltrating CD 133 + progenitors expresses macrophage-specific antigen F 4 / 80 <b>in</b> <b>EAM.</b> These CD 133 +/F 4 / 80 hi cells show impaired myofibrogenic potential compared with CD 133 +/F 4 / 80 − cells. M-CSF treatment of wild-type mice with EAM {{at the peak of}} disease markedly increased CD 133 +/F 4 / 80 hi cells in the myocardium, and CD 133 + progenitors isolated from M-CSF-treated mice failed to differentiate into myofibroblasts. In contrast, M-CSF was not effective in converting CD 133 + progenitors from inflamed hearts of Nos 2 −/− mice into macrophages, and M-CSF treatment did not result in increased CD 133 +/F 4 / 80 hi cell population in hearts of Nos 2 −/− mice. Accordingly, M-CSF prevented post-inflammatory fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction in wild-type but not in Nos 2 −/− mice. Conclusion Active and NOS 2 -dependent induction of macrophage lineage differentiation abrogates the myofibrogenic potential of heart-infiltrating CD 133 + progenitors. Modulating the in vivo differentiation fate of specific progenitors might become a novel approach for the treatment of inflammatory heart disease...|$|E
