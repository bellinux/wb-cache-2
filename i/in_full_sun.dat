5|$|Successful birch {{cultivation}} {{requires a}} climate cool enough {{for at least}} the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they may require water during dry periods. They grow best <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> planted in deep, well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun,</b> although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E

25|$|P. tarminiana invades both {{open and}} closed forest in Hawaii. It grows most rapidly <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> but tolerates some shade. Growth is {{severely}} restricted at relative light intensities {{of less than}} 2%. Where the forest canopy is largely intact, P. tarminiana invades in canopy gaps formed when trees fall or die.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{volumes of}} wolfberries also {{grow in the}} Chinese regions of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei. When ripe, the oblong, red berries are tender and must be picked {{carefully}} or shaken from the vine into trays to avoid spoiling. The fruits are preserved by drying them <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> on open trays or by mechanical dehydration employing a progressively increasing series of heat exposure over 48 hours.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not often}} cultivated, as it is not {{considered}} a particularly attractive plant. In cultivation it grows slowly, but is long-lived; specimens at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne are still healthy and flowering at twenty years of age. It takes from six to seven weeks to germinate, with a germination success rate of around 70%. It requires a very well drained sandy soil <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun.</b> It tolerates drought well, is moderately frost-tolerant, and takes pruning well.|$|E
25|$|Strawberries {{are popular}} and {{rewarding}} plants {{to grow in}} the domestic environment, be it for consumption or exhibition purposes, almost anywhere in the world. The best time to plant is in late summer or spring. Plant <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> or dappled shade, and in somewhat sandy soil. The addition of manure and a balanced fertilizer aids strong growth. Alternatively they can be planted in pots or special planters using compost. Fibre mats placed under each plant will protect fruits from touching the ground, and will act as a weed barrier.|$|E
50|$|The plant grows well in moist to {{wet soil}} and even {{slightly}} submerged in water <b>in</b> partial or <b>full</b> <b>sun.</b> Plants can become invasive in gardens {{and difficult to}} eradicate. Propagation is by division.|$|R
50|$|C. pennisetiformis is a grass {{suited to}} growing in arid and {{semi-arid}} environments because it remains green and palatable {{even in the}} dry season.

25|$|Unshaded coffee plants grown with {{fertilizer}} {{yield the}} most coffee, although unfertilized shaded crops generally yield more than unfertilized unshaded crops: {{the response to}} fertilizer is much greater <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun.</b> While traditional coffee production causes berries to ripen more slowly and produce lower yields, {{the quality of the}} coffee is allegedly superior. In addition, the traditional shaded method provides living space for many wildlife species. Proponents of shade cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution, habitat destruction, and soil and water degradation are the side effects of the practices employed in sun cultivation.|$|E
25|$|The living cycads {{are found}} {{across much of}} the {{subtropical}} and tropical parts of the world. The greatest diversity occurs in South and Central America. They are also found in Mexico, the Antilles, southeastern United States, Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and southern and tropical Africa, where at least 65 species occur. Some can survive in harsh desert or semi-desert climates (xerophytic), others in wet rain forest conditions, and some in both. Some can grow in sand or even on rock, some in oxygen-poor, swampy, bog-like soils rich in organic material. Some are able to grow <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun,</b> some in full shade, and some in both. Some are salt tolerant (halophytes).|$|E
25|$|The five {{to eight}} fleshy, light-green to reddish, {{elliptic}} to lanceolate leaves form a ground-hugging rosette up to 6cm (2.5in) in diameter. The upper surface of the leaves are sticky from the mucilage secreted by stalked glands covering the leaf surface. Small insects alighting upon this surface are caught by the mucilage, upon which sessile glands embedded in the leaf surface (except for the central vein) secrete digestive enzymes to digest the prey. The leaves of this species are able to further aid digestion by growing such that the leaf edge rolls toward the center, bringing additional glands {{into contact with the}} prey. Most plants are reddish-green <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun,</b> though some plant will turn completely red while a smaller percentage will remain completely green.|$|E
50|$|This eremophila has a broom-like {{shape and}} pale to deep lilac-coloured flowers.

25|$|Giant sequoias are in {{many ways}} adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will {{normally}} open immediately after a fire. The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle humus in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic wildfire to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.|$|E
25|$|Highland {{forms are}} those species that grow in {{habitats}} generally higher in elevation, and thus exposed to cooler evening temperatures. Lowland forms are those species growing nearer to sea level. Both forms respond best to rainwater (but some tap water works {{as long as}} it is flushed monthly with rainwater or water low in dissolved solid and chemicals), bright light (though some species can grow <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun),</b> a well-drained medium, good air circulation and relatively high humidity, although easier species such as N.alata can adapt to lower humidity environments. Highland species must have night-time cooling to thrive in the long term. Chemical fertilisers are best used at low strength. Occasional feeding with frozen (thawed before use) crickets may be beneficial. Terrarium culture of smaller plants, such as N.bellii, N.×trichocarpa and N.ampullaria, is possible, but most plants will get too large over time.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} {{as to whether}} achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, {{it may be that}} some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>sun.</b> In patients with achromatopsia, the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.|$|E
