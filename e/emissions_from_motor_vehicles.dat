Specifically, a 10 % increase in the revival rate of used cars contributes to reducing CO 2 by approximately 0.54 %. This finding implies that this market expansion policy would clearly contribute {{to a reduction in}} carbon emissions.

50|$|In 2007, the {{association}} brought {{a lawsuit against}} the state of California, attempting to establish that the state had no authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The association's argument was that the only method to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, is by improving fuel economy and only the U.S. Department of Transportation has authority to establish a fuel economy standard, under federal energy legislation from 1975. As such, California's standards are preempted by federal law. California is able to set its own standards for tailpipe emissions, if it is granted a waiver by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from preemption under the Clean Air Act, as it had begun regulation of air pollution before the EPA was established. The association also argued that if California and other states did have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, that would force manufacturers to make vehicles using too many different standards, effectively raising the cost of cars and eliminating model choices. In December 2007, a district court judge ruled against {{the association}}'s suit. The association appealed this decision. In February 2008, the association issued a statement supporting the EPA's decision not to issue the waiver that would be required for California to regulate greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The association's president, Michael Stanton, stated that its interest was not in resisting such regulation, but ensuring that uniform standards are set by the federal government. In 2009, the association stated its support for an agreement reached by the Obama administration to adopt a single national standard for fuel economy, which led to outstanding lawsuits being dropped.|$|E

5000|$|With one exception, the {{responsibility}} for regulating <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> new <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> under the CAA rests with the EPA.

40|$|Carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> {{urban road}} traffic mainly come from {{automobile}} exhaust. However, the carbon dioxide emissions obtained by the instruments are unreliable due to time delay error. In order to improve the reliability of data, we propose a method to correct the measured vehicles’ carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> instrument based on the CMEM model. Firstly, the synthetic time series of carbon dioxide emissions are simulated by CMEM model and GPS velocity data. Then, taking the simulation data as the control group, the time delay error of the measured carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated by the asynchronous correlation analysis, and the outliers can be automatically identified and corrected using the principle of DTW algorithm. Taking the taxi trajectory data of Wuhan as an example, {{the results show that}} (1) the correlation coefficient between the measured data and the control group data can be improved from 0. 52 to 0. 59 by mitigating the systematic time delay error. Furthermore, by adjusting the outliers which account for 4. 73  % of the total data, the correlation coefficient can raise to 0. 63, which suggests strong correlation. The construction of low carbon traffic has become the focus of the local government.

For this Air Pollution Tolerance Index APTI and selected physiological parameters were taken into account i. e. total chlorophyll ascorbic acid pH relative water content total protein and Nitrate reductase NR. The results showed that D. deremensis have high chlorophyll content ascorbic acid content protein content with high NR activity as compared to D. caryophyllus at all the selected sites. As per Air Pollution Tolerance Index APTI D. deremensis has value of 60. 60 55. 25 amp 55. 93 at Site I II amp III respectively which comes under tolerant range and D. caryophyllus has value of 14. 82 15. 41 amp 15. 93 at Site I II amp III respectively which comes under sensitive range.
