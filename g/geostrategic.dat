5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's <b>geostrategic</b> importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberal and}} {{national}} uprising displeased the Austria of Metternich, the principal political {{architect of the}} Holy Alliance. However, Russia, another reactionary gendarme of Europe, looked favorably on the insurrection due to its Orthodox religious solidarity and its <b>geostrategic</b> interest (control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus). France, another {{active member of the}} Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at Trocadero (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade. Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the regional situation primarily because it lay on the route to India and London wished to exercise a form of control there. For all of Europe, Greece represented the cradle of Western civilisation and of art since antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the signing}} of the treaty, Tyler {{complied}} with the Texans' demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico. In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler's cabinet was split on the administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and <b>geostrategic</b> benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.|$|E
25|$|Vessey and the Service Chiefs {{believed}} that their overriding task lay in convincing Soviet leaders that their quest for military superiority and <b>geostrategic</b> advantage was fruitless. In Europe, they pushed the controversial but successful deployment of Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles to offset the Soviet SS-20 missiles. In Southwest Asia, highly visible US military activities underscored the US commitment to defend its vital interests in the region. In Central America, training and intelligence were provided to support counter-insurgency efforts.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of Turkey's {{membership}} {{argue that}} it is a key regional power with a large economy and the second-largest military force of NATO after the United States that will enhance the EU's position as a global <b>geostrategic</b> player and its Common Foreign and Security Policy; given Turkey's geographic location and economic, political, cultural and historic ties in regions with large natural resources that are at the immediate vicinity of the EU's geopolitical sphere of influence; such as the East Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, the Middle East, the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian parties {{tend not}} to have a clear {{ideology}} but to contain different political groups with diverging ideological outlooks. Unlike in Western politics, civilizational and <b>geostrategic</b> orientations play a more important role than economic and socio-political agendas for parties. This has led to coalition governments that would be unusual from a Western point of view; for example: the Azarov Government which included the Party of Regions with the financial backing of some Ukrainian oligarchs and the Communist Party of Ukraine and the social-democratic Batkivshchyna and the economically liberal European Party of Ukraine in the Second Tymoshenko Government.|$|E
25|$|According to Saul Cohen, early {{colonial era}} strategists treated South Asia with East Asia, {{but in reality}} the South Asia region {{excluding}} Afghanistan is a distinct geopolitical region separated from other nearby <b>geostrategic</b> realms, one that is geographically diverse. The region {{is home to a}} variety of geographical features, such as glaciers, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and grasslands that are typical of much larger continents. It is surrounded by three water bodiesthe Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Seaand has acutely varied climate zones. The tip of the Indian Peninsula had the highest quality pearls.|$|E
25|$|The newly crowned King Frederick II of Prussia saw in Austria's {{succession}} crisis an opportune {{moment for}} the seizure of Silesia. Historians have downplayed the importance of his family's antique claims in the region in Frederick's decision to invade; the province was populous and industrialized, yet economic factors also seem not to have weighed heavily in the Prussian attack. Rather, <b>geostrategic</b> considerations probably played the leading role: Frederick believed (correctly) that Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, who also ruled Poland in personal union, was interested in taking control of Silesia to connect his two realms into one contiguous territory that would almost surround Brandenburg.|$|E
25|$|Iron Age trade {{expansion}} caused regional <b>geostrategic</b> remodeling. Southeast Asia was now {{situated in the}} central area of convergence of the Indian and the East Asian maritime trade routes, the basis for economic and cultural growth. The earliest Hindu kingdoms emerged in Sumatra and Java, followed by mainland polities such as Funan and Champa. Adoption of Indian civilization elements and individual adaptation stimulated the emergence of centralized states {{and the development of}} highly organized societies. Ambitious local leaders realized the benefits of Hinduism and Indian methods of administration, culture, literature, etc. Rule in accord with universal moral principles, represented in the concept of the devaraja, was more appealing than the Chinese concept of intermediaries.|$|E
25|$|The Council of Europe and the United Nations have {{regularly}} {{called upon}} Turkey to legally recognise {{the right to}} conscientious objection. In March 2004, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated that: “Despite Turkey’s <b>geostrategic</b> position, the Assembly demands that Turkey recognises the right to conscientious objection and introduce an alternative civilian service.” In September 2009 the Turkish press reported that the Turkish government is considering creating regulations regarding conscientious objectors. According to the amendment planned on the issue, those refusing to perform compulsory military service {{will no longer be}} forcibly drafted to the military while they are under detention and will be able to be defended by a lawyer while being tried. They will also be able to benefit from the Probation Law.|$|E
25|$|Greece's {{foreign policy}} is {{conducted}} through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its head, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The current minister is Nikos Kotzias. According to the official website, the main aims of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are to represent Greece before other states and international organizations; safeguarding {{the interests of the}} Greek state and of its citizens abroad; the promotion of Greek culture; the fostering of closer relations with the Greek diaspora; and the promotion of international cooperation. Additionally, due to its political and geographical proximity to Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Greece is a country of significant <b>geostrategic</b> importance and {{is considered to be a}} middle power and has developed a regional policy to help promote peace and stability in the Balkans, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Greece is a {{democratic}} and developed country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life, and a very high standard of living. A {{founding member of the}} United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and {{has been part of the}} Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). Greece's unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, prominent shipping sector and <b>geostrategic</b> importance classify it as a middle power. It is the largest economy in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor.|$|E
25|$|The most pro-Greek {{power was}} Russia. As the sole Orthodox Christian great power, Russia had long seen {{itself as the}} {{protector}} (and potential liberator) of the Balkan and Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire, who were predominantly of the Orthodox faith. The Serbs and Bulgarians were also fellow Slavic-speakers. These cultural and emotional bonds dovetailed neatly with Russia's <b>geostrategic</b> interests. Supporting a breakaway Greek state, {{which would be a}} natural ally of Russia, was an obvious way to advance Russian influence in south-east Europe. The main problem for supporters of Greece in Russia was that Greece was only one of several issues that were in contention between St Petersburg and the Sublime Porte: others included Russia's ambition to impose a protectorate over the Romanian principalities and Serbia, its demands for control of the Principalities' Black Sea ports, the right of Russian warships to sail through the Bosporus, and Russia's annexation of territories in the Caucasus.|$|E
500|$|First mapped by Spain in 1519, Texas {{was part}} of the vast Spanish empire seized by the Spanish Conquistadors from its {{indigenous}} people for over 300 years. When the Louisiana territory was acquired by the United States from France in 1803, many in the U.S. believed the new territory included parts or all of present-day Texas. The US-Spain border along the northern frontier of Texas took shape in the 1817–1819 negotiations between Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and the Spanish ambassador to the United States, Luis de Onís y González-Vara. The boundaries of Texas were determined within the larger <b>geostrategic</b> struggle to demarcate the limits of the United States' extensive western lands and of Spain's vast possessions in North America. The Florida Treaty of February 22, 1819 emerged as a compromise that excluded Spain from the lower Columbia River watershed, but established southern boundaries at the Sabine and Red Rivers, [...] "legally extinguish" [...] any American claims to Texas. Nonetheless, Texas remained an object of fervent interest to American expansionists, among them Thomas Jefferson, who anticipated the eventual acquisition of its fertile lands.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Germany had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with the Chinese nationalist government, even providing military aid and assistance to the Republic of China. Relations soured after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, and when China shortly thereafter concluded the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union. Eventually Hitler concluded that Japan, not China, would be a more reliable <b>geostrategic</b> partner, notwithstanding the superior Sino-German economic relationship and chose to end his alliance with the Chinese as the price of gaining an alignment with the more modern and militarily powerful Japan. In a May 1938 address to the Reichstag, Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied puppet state in Manchuria, and renounced the German claims to the former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered the end of arm shipments to China, as well as the recall of all German officers attached to the Chinese Army. Despite this move, however, Hitler retained his general perception of neither the Japanese nor the Chinese civilizations being inferior to the German one. In The Political Testament of Adolf Hitler, he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|From 1960 to 1962, McCain held {{commands}} in the Atlantic, including Amphibious Group 2 and Amphibious Training, {{and served}} on [...] and [...] [...] He was Chief of Naval Information from 1962 to 1963, initiating the post and garnering influence with the Washington press that would aid his career. [...] Following the April 1963 {{loss of the}} nuclear submarine , he explained to the public why {{the search for the}} wreckage would be lengthy and difficult, and defended the Navy against charges that it had been tardy in disclosing details of the disaster. [...] McCain was promoted to vice admiral in July 1963, and was made commander of the entire Amphibious Forces, Atlantic Fleet. [...] He {{came up with the idea}} for Operation Sea Orbit, the voyage around the world without refuelling of three nuclear-powered Navy ships; it was reminiscent of the Great White Fleet circumnavigation that his father had been part of over half a century earlier. [...] Later in 1964, McCain commanded the Operation Steel Pike exercise off the coast of Spain, which was the largest amphibious landing ever in peacetime; he would be awarded be a gold star in lieu of a Legion of Merit for this operation. [...] After the operation he defended the performance of the United States Merchant Marine before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and became a prominent public advocate for the <b>geostrategic</b> importance of the merchant marine.|$|E
500|$|Tyler and {{his allies}} had, since 1843, devised and {{encouraged}} national propaganda promoting Texas annexation, which understated Southern slaveholder's aspirations regarding the future of Texas. Instead, Tyler chose to portray the annexation of Texas as something that would prove economically beneficial to {{the nation as a}} whole. The further introduction of slavery into the vast expanses of Texas and beyond, they argued, would [...] "diffuse" [...] rather than concentrate slavery regionally, ultimately weakening white attachment and dependence on slave labor. This theory was yoked to the growing enthusiasm among Americans for Manifest Destiny, a desire to see the social, economic and moral precepts of republicanism spread across the continent. Moreover, Tyler declared that national security was at stake: If foreign powers – Great Britain in particular – were to gain influence in Texas, it would be reduced to a British cotton-producing reserve and a base to exert <b>geostrategic</b> influence over North America. Texas might be coerced into relinquishing slavery, inducing slave uprisings in adjoining slave states and deepening sectional conflicts between American free-soil and slave-soil interests. The appointment of Calhoun, with his southern states' rights reputation – which some believed was [...] "synonymous with slavery" [...] – threatened to cast doubt on Tyler's carefully crafted reputation as a nationalist. Tyler, though ambivalent, felt obliged to enlist Calhoun as Secretary of State, because Tyler's closest confidantes had, in haste, offered the position to the South Carolinian statesmen {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Princeton disaster. Calhoun would be confirmed by Congress by unanimous vote.|$|E

2500|$|The {{international}} {{reactions to}} the Bahraini uprising of 2011 include responses by supranational organisations, non-governmental organisations, media organisations, and both the governments and civil populaces, like [...] of fellow sovereign states to the protests and uprising in Bahrain during the Arab Spring. The small island nation's territorial position in the Persian Gulf not only makes it a key contending regional power but also determines its <b>geostrategic</b> position as a buffer between the Arab World and Iran. Hence, the overlap in trolls and <b>geostrategic</b> implications aid in explaining international responses to the uprising in Bahrain. [...] Accordingly, as a proxy state between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Bahrain’s domestic politics is both wittingly and unavoidably shaped by regional forces and variables that determine the country’s response to internal and external pressures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{context of}} the three Great Powers' {{intervention}} in the Greek conflict was the Russian Empire's long-running [...] expansion {{at the expense of}} the decaying Ottoman Empire. Russia's ambitions in the region were seen as a major <b>geostrategic</b> threat by the other European powers, which feared the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of Russian hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean. The precipitating factor was Russia's strong emotional support for the fellow-Orthodox Christian Greeks, who had rebelled against their Ottoman overlords in 1821. The British were motivated by strong public support for the Greeks. [...] Fearing unilateral Russian action in support of the Greeks, Britain and France bound Russia by treaty to a joint intervention which aimed to secure Greek autonomy whilst preserving Ottoman territorial integrity as a check on Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Iran ( [...] ), {{also known}} as Persia (...) , officially the Islamic Republic of Iran ( [...] ), is a {{sovereign}} state in Western Asia.

Iran is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq.

2500|$|This resounding success {{came as a}} {{complete}} surprise even to the Germans, who hardly had dared to hope for such an outcome. Most generals had vehemently opposed the plan as being much too risky; even those supporting it had mainly done so out of desperation because the <b>geostrategic</b> position of Germany seemed so hopeless. Count Ciano later in the war observed that [...] "victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan" [...] and Fall Gelb would have no lack of sires.

2500|$|After September 11 attacks {{some people}} {{came to believe that}} a {{possible}} motivation for the attacks included justifying the invasions of Afghanistan as well as <b>geostrategic</b> interests such as the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline project. [...] The new deal on the pipeline was signed on 27 December 2002 by the leaders of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2005, the Asian Development Bank submitted the final version of a feasibility study designed by British company Penspen. The project has drawn strong US support as it would allow the Central Asian republics to export energy to Western markets [...] "without relying on Russian routes". Then-US Ambassador to Turkmenistan Ann Jacobsen noted that: [...] "We are seriously looking at the project, and {{it is quite possible that}} American companies will join it". Due to increasing instability, the project has essentially stalled; construction of the Turkmen part was supposed to start in 2006, but the overall feasibility is questionable since the southern part of the Afghan section runs through territory which continues to be under de facto Taliban control.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the President of Pakistan Asif Zardari {{asserted}} at {{a conference}} in Islamabad that Pakistan had indeed created Islamic militant groups as a strategic tool for use in its <b>geostrategic</b> agenda and [...] "to attack Indian forces in Jammu and Kashmir". Former President of Pakistan and the ex-chief of the Pakistan military Pervez Musharraf also stated in an interview that Pakistani government helped to form underground militant groups to fight against Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir and [...] "turned a blind eye" [...] towards their existence because it wanted to force India to enter negotiations. The British Government have formally accepted that there is a clear connection between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and three major militant outfits operating in Jammu and Kashmir, Lashkar-e-Tayiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. The militants are provided with [...] "weapons, training, advice and planning assistance" [...] in Punjab and Kashmir by the ISI which is [...] "coordinating the shipment of arms from the Pakistani side of Kashmir to the Indian side, where Muslim insurgents are waging a protracted war".|$|E
2500|$|Nehru, while a pacifist, was not {{blind to}} the {{political}} and <b>geostrategic</b> reality of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated: [...] "We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, {{we have to face}} all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defense methods and a well-equipped army, navy and air force." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Gasiorowski edited {{a book on}} {{the coup}} arguing that [...] "the climate of intense cold war rivalry between the superpowers, {{together}} with Iran's strategic vital location between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, led U.S. officials to believe that they had to take whatever steps were necessary to prevent Iran from falling into Soviet hands." [...] While [...] "these concerns seem vastly overblown today" [...] the pattern of [...] "the 1945–46 Azerbaijan crisis, the consolidation of Soviet control in Eastern Europe, the communist triumph in China, and the Korean War—and with the Red Scare at its height in the United States" [...] would not allow U.S. officials to risk allowing the Tudeh Party to gain power in Iran. Furthermore, [...] "U.S. officials believed that resolving the oil dispute was essential for restoring stability in Iran, and after March 1953 it appeared that the dispute could be resolved only at the expense either of Britain or of Mosaddeq." [...] He concludes [...] "it was <b>geostrategic</b> considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq's movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran's oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Inward Hunger, Williams recounts that in {{the period}} {{following}} his graduation: [...] "I was severely handicapped in my research by my lack of money.... I was turned down everywhere I tried ... and could not ignore the racial factor involved". However, in 1936, thanks to a recommendation made by Sir Alfred Claud Hollis (Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, 1930–36), the Leathersellers' Company awarded him a £50 grant to continue his advanced research in history at Oxford. He completed the D.Phil in 1938 {{under the supervision of}} Vincent Harlow. His doctoral thesis was titled The Economic Aspects of the Abolition of the Slave Trade and West Indian Slavery, and was published as Capitalism and Slavery in 1944. It was both a direct attack on the idea that moral and humanitarian motives were the key facts in the victory of British abolitionism, and a covert critique of the idea common in the 1930s, emanating in particular from the pen of Oxford Professor Reginald Coupland, that British imperialism was essentially propelled by humanitarian and benevolent impulses. Williams's argument owed much to the influence of C. L. R. James, whose The Black Jacobins, also completed in 1938, also offered an economic and <b>geostrategic</b> explanation for the rise of British abolitionism.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{their lack}} of enthusiasm for the rebellion, the British and French governments were under {{mounting}} pressure from their home public opinion to assist the Greeks. Whatever the <b>geostrategic</b> implications of their revolt, the Greeks, {{in the eyes of}} most Britons and Frenchmen, were gallant Christian fighters struggling to free themselves from a corrupt and oppressive Islamic tyranny. In an era when nationalism was inextricably linked to liberalism, the Greek insurgency became a rallying-cry for liberals all over Europe, and especially for French liberals, whose political action at home were severely restricted by the Bourbon monarchy restored to power by the Allied powers in 1815. Both London and Paris hosted powerful philhellenic committees, supported by prominent and wealthy personalities, such as the romantic poet Lord Byron in England (who [...] died fighting for the Greek cause in 1824) and the writers Chateaubriand and Victor Hugo in France. The Committees raised large sums of money for the Greek revolutionaries, agitated in the press and equipped and despatched hundreds of volunteers to fight in Greece. Popular pressure for intervention intensified after Ibrahim Pasha's brutal invasion of the Peloponnese. The atrocities committed by his forces, loudly advertised and greatly exaggerated in the liberal press, sparked a furore throughout Europe. Ibrahim was denounced in the French press as Le Sanguinaire ("The Bloodthirsty One"). This was acutely embarrassing to the French government, which had equipped and trained the Egyptian forces. The Greek revolt was probably the first occasion in European history when public opinion {{had a significant impact on}} great power foreign policy.|$|E

In 2010, while lecturing on nuclear weapons politics, Majid endorsed Qadeer Khan's services and stressed to the fact that: [...] "Pakistan had {{to be mindful of}} a blatant pursuit of military preponderance in its eastern neighborhood".
