30|$|Following the {{explanation}} of the Delphi-fuzzy figure (continuing with Fig.  6), {{but in the case}} of fundamental ethics where consensus is normally unattainable, the Delphi method allows delimiting the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>application</b> space as the argument area, and also allows identifying the distance between the participants and the consensus area (called area 1). In this case, the aim is to define the value system (P). For example, continuing with the fair trade case, it will involve whether the overpays will be fair. One might ask, for instance, why the fair price is not the market price. Why is it unethical? What are the criteria for the new price? What criteria are applied? Costs? Benefits? Needs? In this case, it would be optimal to reach consensus (area referred to as 1), but it is complex because it works with different value systems. However, the Delphi method is optimal because the reasoned reflection process improves the options for reaching some sort of consensus on the value system. It is more than likely that no consensus will be reached with the Delphi method, although it may identify areas of disagreement and the distances between experts; furthermore, it allows excluding the areas that fall outside the discussion because of a lack of consistency in the participants’ arguments. Thus, it allows us to limit the discussion of the problem area (<b>fuzzy</b> <b>application</b> space). The aim is to solve a conceptual problem, so it will be complex. It is admittedly a limitation of the Delphi approach, but it will be useful and feasible at least for delimiting the discussion area.|$|E

Instead of the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>application</b> dependent notion of feature, a new approach based on information theoretic concepts is introduced in this paper to detect important regions. This is accomplished by extending the concept of local statistical complexity from finite state cellular automata to discretized (multi-) fields. Thus, informative parts of the data can be highlighted in an application-independent, purely mathematical sense. The new measure can be applied to unsteady multifields on regular grids in any application domain.

30|$|Our {{findings}} suggest that the Delphi method could be on a par with other methods (survey, interview, focus group, and case study) used in business ethics. The experts are extremely honest and highly confident, they do not feel any peer pressure, and feedback is helpful to them; however, they do not give much importance to consensus (one of the potential characteristic of Delphi), with this being referred to as “Consensus Paradox”, probably because argumentation and discussion are key elements in business ethics, but there is a barrier to the possibility that opinions are diluted. Moreover, this paper suggests that using the Delphi method renders it possible to refine the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>application</b> space in which business ethics is embedded, not only to determine the decisions in a value system, but also to establish the value system itself. The aim is therefore to contribute to knowledge in business ethics, both by accepting a new process to resolve, predict or evaluate ethical businesses aspects, and as a tool to improve ethical decision-making.|$|E

40|$|TEX (explosive atmosphere) risk {{assessment}} is required when any equipment or system can potentially cause explosive atmospheres. Although many operations are performed by operators, influences from human and organizational factors (HOFs) are mostly neglected. In {{order to address}} HOFs influence, the ATEX-HMI (Human-Machine Interaction) methodology is proposed: it aims at integrating HOFs into {{each step of the}} standard ATEX {{risk assessment}}.

Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) is the main method for the HEP assessment, thus two HRA methods were applied for the ATEX-HMI methodology.

This paper studies the impact of the real interest rate on aggregate investments in four of the Southeast Asian countries- Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines from 1995 to 2003 using a non-linear fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is ideal for modeling human decision making in an intuitive manner. Linstrom (1998) first applied fuzzy logic approach to investigate the relationship between real interest rate and aggregate investments in Sweden. In his approach, a multivalued logic and a fuzzy indicator are strictly derived from the interest rate. Based on Linstrom work, I develop and extend the fuzzy methodology. The fuzzy model is implemented using Maple language. The results are compared with Linstrom (1998) and two other similar previous studies Tiglioglu (2006), Wang and Yu (2007) with regression models. The overall result appears that there is not any consistency and significant improvement in the performance in these regressions by the approach of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>application</b> taken, and that the introduction of the fuzzification actually worsens the performance.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{construction}} industry has started to embrace IBS {{as a method of}} attaining better construction quality and productivity and reducing risks related to occupational safety and health. The built of pre-fabricated component in factories reduces many problems related to lack of purposing uncertainty in scheduling calculation and time management of projects. In the case of using IBS method for managing time in projects, former studies such as Allan Tay’s research, indicates that this method can save up at least 29 % of overall completion period versus the conventional method. But beside mentioned advantages of this technical method, the projects could be optimized more and more in scheduling calculations. This issue is critical in gas refineries, since special parameters such as risk of spreading poison H 2 S gas and mandatory of performing projects in short time period events such as maintenance overhauls demands to perform projects in optimum time.
