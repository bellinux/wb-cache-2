Founded in Aberdeen in 1849 to supply sailing ships with food, the company opened their first English cannery and <b>food</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> at Millwall dock in 1872 and attracted a workforce from across the country, including {{the east coast of}} Scotland, primarily Dundee. The club secretary was 17-year-old Jasper Sexton, the son of the landlord of The Islander pub in Tooke Street where Millwall held their club meetings. Millwall Rovers' first fixture was held on a piece of waste ground on Glengall Road, on 3 October 1885 against Fillebrook, a team that played in Leytonstone. The newly formed team were beaten 5–0.|$|E

2500|$|Efforts {{were made}} to bring the ship off the rock, but these were halted on November 12, 1949, and, two days later, the {{underwriters}} declared {{that the value of}} the vessel would not justify further expense to refloat the ship. [...] The hulk was sold to Victor David, who ran a food processing firm, reportedly for $1,600. [...] Two days later, David was able to have the holes in the hull patched, pull the vessel free, and have it beached in North Vancouver, where he planned to convert it to a <b>food</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plant.</b> [...] This was considered a salvage feat by the local marine community. [...] The city apparently needed to approve this conversion. [...] It did not, and so David sold the hulk for scrap in 1951.

40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) need an {{excellent}} and reliable traceability system {{to ensure that}} consumers are well protected from consuming unsafe food. The traceability systems are being implemented by different food industries {{all around the world}} including Malaysia. This study aims to determine the implementation status of traceability system among <b>food</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> and SMEs. Another important goal is to identify the Critical Traceability Points (CTPs) in <b>food</b> <b>processing</b> and SMEs’ supply chains. A survey involving 17 <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> and 53 SMEs from Kelantan, Malaysia, on the traceability and product recall system was conducted. The findings revealed that the <b>food</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> and SMEs are interested in implementing traceability system but they lack information and capital to carry out the system. Receiving (χ 2 = 0. 51;[*][*]df= 1;[*][*]P< 0. 05) and dispatching (χ 2 = 9. 66;[*][*]df= 1;[*][*]P< 0. 05) were identified as the CTPs in <b>food</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> and SMEs. Only 52. 9 % of the participants had implemented or were interested in implementation of traceability system. Several factors resulting in the lack of traceability implementation are due to time limitation, no perceivable benefits to the company’s economy and lack of clear policy guidance and support from government...|$|R
