40|$|The NLAS 6233 is a DPDT switch {{featuring}} Popless {{noise suppression}} circuitry {{designed to prevent}} pass through of undesirable transient signals known as pops. Intended for audio systems within portable applications, it provides protection against audible pops that are generated when switching between two different audio sources, such as an amplifier and a CODEC. The NLAS 6233 incorporates two <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> <b>switches</b> controlled by a single select line which allows the system controller to simultaneously switch between two sets of signal lines. The Popless noise suppression circuitry controls the ON and OFF times that define the time interval when switching between the normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) terminals. This allows any pops to be dissipated within the system before the switch settles into a closed position. The NLAS 6233 operates off of a single supply voltage, VCC, and is available in an ultra-thin UQFN 10 package...|$|E
40|$|The ADG 733 and ADG 734 are low voltage, CMOS devices {{comprising}} three independently selectable SPDT (single pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw)</b> <b>switches</b> {{and four}} independently selectable SPDT switches respectively. Low power consumption and operating supply range of 1. 8 V to 5. 5 V and dual ± 2. 5 V make the ADG 733 and ADG 734 ideal for battery powered, portable instruments. All channels exhibit break-before-make switching action preventing momentary shorting when switching channels. An EN input on the ADG 733 {{is used to}} enable or disable the device. When disabled, all channels are switched OFF. These 2 – 1 multiplexers/SPDT switches are designed on an enhanced submicron process that provides low power dissipation yet gives high switching speed, very low on resistance, high signal bandwidths, and low leakage currents. On resistance is {{in the region of}} a few ohms, is closely matched between switches, and is very flat over the full signal range. These parts can operate equally well in either direction and have an input signal range that extends to the supplies...|$|E

5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, multiway switching is the interconnection {{of two or}} more electrical {{switches to}} control an electrical load (often, but not always, lighting) from more than one location. For example, this allows lighting in a hallway, stairwell or large room to be controlled from multiple locations.While a [...] "normal" [...] light switch needs to be only a single pole, single <b>throw</b> (SPST) <b>switch,</b> multiway switching requires the use of switches that have one or more additional contacts and two or more wires must be run between the switches.

50|$|The {{original}} Schmitt trigger {{is based}} on the dynamic threshold idea that is implemented by a voltage divider with a switchable upper leg (the collector resistors RC1 and RC2) and a steady lower leg (RE). Q1 acts as a comparator with a differential input (Q1 base-emitter junction) consisting of an inverting (Q1 base) and a non-inverting (Q1 emitter) inputs. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input; the output voltage of the voltage divider is applied to the non-inverting input thus determining its threshold. The comparator output drives the second common collector stage Q2 (an emitter follower) through the voltage divider R1-R2. The emitter-coupled transistors Q1 and Q2 actually compose an electronic <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> <b>switch</b> that switches over the upper legs of the voltage divider and changes the threshold in a different (to the input voltage) direction.|$|R

The Single Pole <b>Double</b> <b>Throw</b> <b>switch</b> constructed with shunt mounted PIN diodes is shown to be bandlimited due to the line lengths involved in the operation.
