500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth season {{episode of}} [...] titled The Modern Prometheus has Mary Shelley draw her {{inspiration}} from two immortals battling {{during the long}} winter in the Swiss Alps. Upon seeing Byron (in the series secretly an Immortal) restored to life by lightning, she asks Methos why her child rots in her grave while Byron simply <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away. Methos admonishes her to pity their kind, for life can go on when it should not. The isolation he describes enables Shelley to write her classic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Emil Nava and was premiered on 30 January 2011. The video begins closing up on a giant teddy bear that is missing an eye and an arm, accompanied by a musical box-rendering of Johann Strauss II's The Blue Danube, before zooming out to show a child version of Jessie J sitting next to it, who then <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> around the bear, turning her into her full-sized self. Jessie J is then shown standing and holding out her hands, and as the lyrics suggest, a coconut man and a moonhead appear on her outstretched hands (this is {{a reference to the}} two individuals who co-wrote the song with her: Dr. Luke is coconut man and Kelly is moonhead in reference to his large head) and pointing to herself (referring to herself as pea because of her small head). The video then goes back to Jessie J in the lap of the large teddy bear and shows various scenes of Jessie J holding up items that relate to the lyrics, including a huge price tag and pointing to left and the right. As the chorus begins, Jessie J is shown dancing under a money tree with dollar bills covering its branches. A scene of Jessie J is then shown of her as an oversized ballerina in a jewelry box. As Jessie J says the words [...] "video hoes", a scene of her wearing the same outfit as in her [...] "Do It Like a Dude" [...] video and dancing holding her crotch, suggesting that she does not approve of video hoes. Jessie J is next shown riding around on a small tricycle. As the song progresses into the second chorus, Jessie J and two background dancers are shown as marionettes, with Jessie J wearing a Pinocchio hat, dancing to the song. The video then moves to B.o.B as his verse begins, showing him dancing in front of a beat up car, that starts jumping and moving to the beat. He is then shown {{standing in the middle of}} four large, toy green army men. As his verse ends, Jessie J is shown squeezed into a doll house and holding a glass doll that is missing part of its head. As the video goes into its final chorus, scenes of Jessie J are shown her dancing with B.o.B, laying on the floor missing a leg, sitting in an oversized chair, dressed up as a doll in a blue and white dress, and dancing with her younger self. The video ends with Jessie J closing the door to her doll house; with her still inside it, the camera carries on zooming out.|$|E

2500|$|Healing the paralytic at Capernaum {{appears in}} , [...] and [...] The Synoptics state that a paralytic {{was brought to}} Jesus on a mat; Jesus told him to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk,</b> <b>and</b> the man did so. Jesus also told the man that his sins were forgiven, which irritated the Pharisees. Jesus is {{described}} as responding to the anger by asking whether {{it is easier to}} say that someone's sins are forgiven, or to tell the man to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk.</b> Mark <b>and</b> Luke state that Jesus was in a house at the time, and that the man had to be lowered through the roof by his friends due to the crowds blocking the door.|$|R
5000|$|The CSI {{episode title}} [...] "Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead" [...] also parodies the quote, with the episode {{focusing}} on how two victims who are supposedly dead <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> away.|$|R

6000|$|NAPOLEON (laughing grimly and {{pinching}} her cheek). That is the {{one question}} you must never ask a soldier.

60|$|Hades {{is not an}} {{unpleasant}} place. Most of the people look rather cheerful. You don't see any frantic gamblers gnashing their teeth or dashing down their last stakes. The winners have the most anxious faces; or the poor shabby fellows who have got systems, and are pricking down the alternations of red and black on cards, and don't seem to be playing at all. On fete days the country people come in, men and women, to gamble; and THEY seem to be excited as they put down their hard-earned florins with trembling rough hands, and watch {{the turn of the}} wheel. But what you call the good company is very quiet and easy. A man loses his mass of gold, and <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> off, without any particular mark of despair. The only gentleman whom I saw at Noirbourg who seemed really affected was a certain Count de Mustacheff, a Russian of enormous wealth, who clenched his fists, beat his breast, cursed his stars, and absolutely cried with grief: not for losing money, but for neglecting to win and play upon a coup de vingt, a series in which the red was turned up twenty times running: which series, had he but played, it is clear that he might have broken M. Lenoir's bank, and shut up the gambling-house, and doubled his own fortune--when he would have been no happier, and all the balls and music, all the newspaper-rooms and parks, all the feasting and pleasure of this delightful Rougetnoirbourg would have been at an end.|$|E

60|$|As for cats, they {{nearly equal}} human beings for vanity. I have known a cat <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> {{out of the}} room on a remark {{derogatory}} to her species being made by a visitor, while a neatly turned compliment will set them purring for an hour.|$|R

50|$|A {{teardrop}} {{comes out}} of her left eye and drops into a puddle below, causing ripples to appear.
