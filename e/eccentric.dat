5|$|The {{proposed}} {{capture of}} Triton may explain several {{features of the}} Neptunian system, including the extremely <b>eccentric</b> orbit of Neptune's moon Nereid and the scarcity of moons {{as compared to the}} other giant planets. Triton's initially <b>eccentric</b> orbit would have intersected orbits of irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller regular moons, dispersing them through gravitational interactions.|$|E

5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, {{greater than that of}} Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the Sun at perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most <b>eccentric</b> orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more <b>eccentric</b> orbit.|$|E

5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an <b>eccentric</b> orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly <b>eccentric</b> orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike {{performed}} {{computer simulations}} {{of the structure}} of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani.

5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an <b>eccentric</b> orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion {{resonances}} with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E
