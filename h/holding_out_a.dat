25|$|Some {{groups have}} seen commemoratives as <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> romanticized view of America. Others have {{promoted}} issues {{as a part}} of grander strategies fighting for social and political equality. Commemorative committees, business leaders, and politicians have actively pursued federal postage stamps celebrating regional anniversaries held at battlefields. Others sought stamps honoring military, cultural, and political heroes, such as Robert E. Lee, Susan B. Anthony, and Frederick Douglass.|$|E
25|$|That {{following}} day, 14 February 1779, Cook {{marched through}} the village to retrieve the King. Cook took the King (aliʻi nui) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go until he stopped and sat where he stood. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on {{his face in the}} surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} they claimed that {{a feeling of}} oppression and dreariness came over them. They then saw some men who looked like palace gardeners, who told them to go {{straight}} on. Moberly later described the men as [...] "very dignified officials, dressed in long greyish green coats with small three-cornered hats." [...] Jourdain noticed a cottage with {{a woman and a}} girl in the doorway. The woman was <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> jug to the girl. Jourdain described it as a [...] "tableau vivant", a living picture, much like Madame Tussauds waxworks. Moberly did not observe the cottage, but felt the atmosphere change. She wrote: [...] "Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees seemed to become flat and lifeless, like wood worked in tapestry. There were no effects of light and shade, and no wind stirred the trees." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saint Nicholas is {{a popular}} subject portrayed on countless Eastern Orthodox icons, {{particularly}} Russian ones. He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book. Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded. Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, full, white, fluffy beard and balding head. In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion. Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors; Medieval Chants and Polyphony, image {{on the cover of}} the Book of Hours of Duke of Berry, 1410 ...|$|E
