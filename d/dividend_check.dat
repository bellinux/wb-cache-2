50|$|A {{dividend}} reinvestment {{plan is a}} plan {{offered by}} a company to the shareholders. This means the shareholders can purchase additional shares or fractions of shares of the same company. So the company does not give a <b>dividend</b> <b>check</b> to the shareholders {{when it is time}} to pay the dividends. Instead, the company takes that money and buys additional shares of the company under the investors' names. Therefore, the investors receive additional shares as a dividend.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a letter}} from the Charles B. Moore Collection. In this letter, Wysong informs Moore that he has {{enclosed}} a <b>dividend</b> <b>check</b> for $ 150. 00. He notes that the minimal amount of capital stock has passed into the permanent surplus fund and details that the <b>dividend</b> <b>check</b> is an amount that is higher than previous years and is much more than they should expect to earn in the future. Wysong mentions that with White's continued cooperation, reasonable returns will be a realization and with those returns as a foundation, a conservative bank will be built. The envelope is included with the letter...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, Montana Power, a century-old {{electric}} power {{company with a}} colorful history, decided that it should divest itself of its electric legacy and instead dive in the deep end of the telecom pool. Touch America was born of this endeavor, but as the decision makers carrying out this new endeavor looked like genius, the business cycle struck, and the telecom [...] "nuclear winter" [...] sent Touch America into bankruptcy. Montana Power, whom so many relied on for pensions and <b>dividend</b> <b>checks,</b> was no more; its assets were eventually purchased by Northwestern Energy.|$|R
50|$|In some DRIPs, the {{investor}} has {{the option of}} receiving some or all <b>dividends</b> by <b>check,</b> as opposed to full reinvestment. Also, if a DRIP is discontinued, {{the investor}}'s shares typically continue {{to be held in}} book-entry form, either including fractional shares or with a refund check issued for the fractional part of the position.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} unmitigated {{administrative}} success, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) {{is not immune}} from political and legal controversy. The symbolic and financial importance that Alaskans ascribe to their annual <b>dividend</b> <b>checks</b> has generated disputes between ordinary residents and executive agencies over eligibility. Litigation concerning three dominant status requirements - minimum residency, U. S. citizenship, and felony incarceration - reveal not only {{the extent to which}} Alaskans will pursue what they believe to be valid claims on their share of natural resource wealth, but also the limits of full political membership in the state. This Comment frames a sample of the Alaska Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions on PFD eligibility in terms of membership in Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s political community. The PFD reflects the Alaska Legislature 2 ̆ 7 s opinion about valid beneficiaries from oil revenues, and the state courts police eligibility at the margin. This Comment therefore argues that the Alaska Supreme Court implicitly determines, on the basis of statutory intent and administrative rule interpretations, 2 ̆ 2 insiders 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 outsiders 2 ̆ 2 within the state 2 ̆ 7 s political community...|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} Deutsche Bank {{acquisition}} in November 1998, BT {{pleaded guilty to}} institutional fraud due {{to the failure of}} certain members of senior management to escheat abandoned property to the State of New York and other states. Rather than turn over to the states funds from dormant customer accounts and uncashed <b>dividend</b> and interest <b>checks</b> as required by law, certain of the bank's senior executives credited this money as income and moved it to its operating account.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{analysis}} is widely applied {{by the majority}} of equity investors on the developed stock markets. However, it is still of questionable value on the emerging markets due to certain market constraints (e. g. low liquidity, small number of investors, weak transparency). The present research is the continuation of the study made by the authors in 2009. Value creation of fundamental analysis was tested within Baltic equity market context by applying key fundamental analysis ratios: PE, ROE, equity ratio, PB etc. to the stock selection. Liquidity, plausibility of earnings as well as <b>dividend</b> payments were <b>checked</b> whether they could be performance creation sources. These concepts were tested during three market phases: pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis. One of the key conclusions drawn was that fundamental analysis gains popularity and is more often employed by Baltic investors, particularly in the post-crisis period...|$|R
