Despite all the ownership changes and recipe changes, many tasters seem to agree that it retains at least some hint of its original character. The most notable changes are a markedly lower bitterness, lower alcohol content, less hops, and in general a much less assertive aromatic character.

It was also around this time that the Old Crown label changed from the red, black and gold, gothic design they had been using since the 30s, to a simpler, more modern style: Red, white and gold for beer and green and silver for ale.

5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, <b>hop</b> <b>oils</b> and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|R
40|$|The ‘early kettle’ {{hop aroma}} of beer is quite complex, since losses, {{chemical}} oxidations {{as well as}} biotransformations of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> constituents occur during the brewing process, resulting in ‘hoppy’ aroma in the final beer that is clearly different from the aroma of raw hops. In this respect, oxygenated terpenoids have been suggested {{to play a major}} role, although their behaviour/formation during the brewing process has not yet been fully understood. By performing lab scale experiments, we have proven that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons can be oxidized during boiling into a whole series of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, some of them being highly flavour-active. In order to verify to what extent these findings are applicable to real brewing practice, we brewed a kettle hopped beer and monitored the <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> compounds from kettle boil up to the cask. Interestingly, after both early and late kettle hopping we observed an increase in the level of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids {{as a function of the}} boiling time. A huge amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was lost during the whirlpool stage whereas the fermentation process led to losses of all <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> compounds, although the oxygenated sesquiterpenoids were better retained in the green beer. In conclusion, ‘early’ kettle hopping does not lead to spillage of all <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> compounds, as believed by many brewers, but instead provides significant levels of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, that may be key impact compounds for ‘kettle’ hoppy aroma of beer. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hops {{constitute}} an indispensable {{raw material for}} beer production. The hop essential oil (-derived) volatiles are at {{the origin of the}} highly desired hoppy aroma of beer. (Bio) chemical transformations and losses during the brewing process alter the <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> volatile fingerprint, resulting in hoppy aroma in beer that is clearly different from the aroma of the hops. Nevertheless, the nature of hoppy aroma is up-to-date far from understood. Especially ‘noble kettle hop’ aroma, which is a typical flavour characteristic of traditional Pilsner-type beers obtained by vigorous boiling of aroma hops, has been a matter of debate and knowledge concerning this controversial issue remains contradictory and fragmentary. This PhD study aims at providing scientific insights into the impact of the boiling process on the analytical and sensory characteristics of hop essential oil volatiles. Such knowledge is of utmost importance to completely understand the chemical background of ‘kettle hop’ aroma. In first instance, a literature overview on hops, hop aroma, (bio) chemical transformations of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> volatiles during the brewing process and hoppy aroma of beer is presented. In order to obtain scientific insights on changes in the <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> volatile profile upon boiling, lab scale boiling experiments (in water) with total hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) were conducted. HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis and multivariate data analysis (PCA, CA) revealed clustering between unboiled and boiled hop essential oil samples, due to decreases in terpene hydrocarbon levels and an increase in the level of particular α-humulene and β-caryophyllene oxidation and hydrolysis products upon boiling. Also a series of volatiles specific for boiled <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> could be observed, pointing to de novo generation of volatiles {{as a result of the}} boiling process. Sensory evaluations of boiled hop essential oil in non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer demonstrated that boiled <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> imparts ‘spicy/herbal’ impressions and ‘kettle hop’ aroma to beer. Seen the interesting flavour characteristics (spicy, herbal notes) of boiled hop essential oil, the search for <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> volatiles involved in this flavour impression was further focused by SPE fractionation of boiled hop essential oil. Fractions expressing ‘spicy’ and ‘hoppy’ notes when spiked to water were subjected to comprehensive analytical profiling via HS-SPME-GC-MS. Comparison of the boiled <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions with the corresponding unboiled <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions allowed for identification of additional volatiles formed de novo during the boiling process. Sensory evaluation of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions in non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer suggested that fractions containing high oxygenated sesquiterpenoid levels are most relevant in relation to ‘kettle hop’ aroma. Moreover, an SPE methodology was developed to enrich oxygenated sesquiterpenoids from commercial kettle hopped lager beers. Many compounds formed de novo upon lab scale boiling of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> (cv. Saaz) were detected in the commercial beers. Moreover, GC-O analysis demonstrated that several α-humulene and β-caryophyllene oxidation products elute in flavour-active zones of the hop oil-derived fractions as well as in the fractions derived from a commercial lager beer. Enrichment of a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction from total hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) and subsequent lab scale boiling of this fraction unambiguously proved oxidation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Moreover, SPE isolation of the sesquiterpene oxidation products formed de novo and addition of this fraction to non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer demonstrated a cause-and-effect relationship between these constituents and ‘spicy/kettle hop’ flavour. Via GC-O analysis of the oxidation product fraction, two intervals with significant odour-activity were established. Humulene epoxide III, humulenol II, caryophylla- 4 (12), 8 (13) -diene- 5 α/β-ol, (3 Z) -caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 α-ol, 14 -hydroxy-β-caryophyllene and (3 Z) -caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 β-ol were identified in these intervals and since except for humulene epoxide III all these oxidation products were also found in flavour-active zones of a commercial kettle hopped lager beer, these volatiles are candidate key impact compounds for ‘kettle hop’ aroma. By boiling increasing hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) concentrations in both water and wort, a positive correlation between the initial <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> concentration and formation of sesquiterpene oxidation products upon boiling was found. Varietal aspects were also investigated (cv. Saaz, cv. Hallertau Tradition, cv. Perle and cv. Magnum). The results suggest that most of the sesquiterpene oxidation products formed de novo during boiling are identical for the different varieties, and thus point to the importance of the intrinsic <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> composition for development of ‘kettle hop’ aroma during the brewing process. Moreover, selinenols and related compounds (i. e. cadinols, muurolols, eudesmols) could not be detected upon boiling of a selinene-rich sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction cv. Super Pride, supporting the hypothesis that these compounds are biosynthesised by the hop plant. Finally, scientific insights obtained on lab scale were verified in real brewing practice by brewing eight different pilot-scale lager beers, aromatised with Saaz hop pellets or <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> (-derived fractions). Analysis of wort samples of an ‘early’ kettle hopped beer indicated de novo formation of sesquiterpene oxidation products during the wort boiling process. This aroma profile of this beer was predominated by ‘spicy/herbal’ impressions. Combination of ‘early’ and ‘late’ kettle hopping resulted in a highly appreciated beer with intense ‘kettle hop’ flavour. A delicate balance between both ‘spicy/herbal’ and ‘floral/citrusy’ connotations appeared to be required in order to obtain the full complex spectrum of ‘kettle hop’ flavour. Aromatisation by post-fermentation addition of the sesquiterpene oxidation product fraction resulted in a beer that approached the flavour of an ‘early’ kettle hopped beer. Using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), the previously proposed candidate key impact compounds could be identified in both the fraction and the resulting beer. Moreover, addition of this oxidation product fraction positively influenced the bitterness perception and significantly increased mouthfeel aspects. Post-fermentation aromatisation with boiled <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in a beer that received a high score for ‘kettle hop’ aroma and, moreover, the flavour profile of this beer was highly comparable to a conventionally kettle hopped Pilsner-type lager beer. It was concluded that these two new aromatisation technologies impart interesting flavour characteristics to beer and are promising techniques to mimic ‘kettle hop’ flavour by post-fermentation aromatisation. status: publishe...|$|E

Post-fermentation addition (at ppb levels) of these purified sesquiterpenoid essences from various European aroma hops led to distinctive spicy or herbal flavour notes, reminiscent of typical 'noble' hop aroma.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of craft brewing, the popularity of intense hoppy beer styles and breeding of new flavor hop varieties (with high oil contents and intense hop character) has increased. Hop citrus character is currently poorly characterized and therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the odour-active molecules of citrusy <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fraction, in an attempt to investigate the relationship with the citrus character of some commercial hop varieties. We report in this work the results achieved in characterizing citrus hop character and the relevance in terms of production of commercial hop product fractions available to brewers. Hop essential oils were obtained from several varieties by steam distillation. The sensory profile of these hop oils was determined with the selected varieties divided in two groups; ‘citrusy’ and ‘not-citrusy’ hops. Volatile compounds were determined using reference compounds. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) was used to fractionate hop essential oil, using a C 18 column stationary phase. Hop oils, suspended in an ethanol/water solution, were pipetted on the C 18 column and eluted to allow <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> compounds to be adsorbed into the stationary phase. The adsorbed compounds were selectively desorbed and pipetted into a range of ethanol/MQ-water solutions and the effluents collected. The <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions were analysed by HS-SPME-GC-MS and Cluster analysis (Ward’s Method, Squared Euclidean) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were carried out. Sensory and chromatographic analysis of the varietal hop oils highlighted the citrusy hop character in specific fractions. The fraction 70 / 30 was selected for further analysis. Considerable differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition between the hop varieties were found by the GC-MS analysis of the 70 / 30 fraction. Analysis of citrus character in varietal hop essential oil was determined for several varieties with citrus intensity in the hop cones. These were compared and contrasted with non-citrus hop and citrus fruits. Cluster and PCA analysis highlighted the role of geraniol in citrus character. This project has identified initial practical benefits for the Hop Industry, namely the screening for citrus character of new hop varieties being bred, the ability to compound <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions to create citrus intense fractions, and to increase our understanding of hop citrus character and the synergistic effects of geraniol rich compounds in citrus intensity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Next to the brewing water, malt and yeast, hops (Humulus lupulus&n bsp;L.) {{constitute}} a basic {{raw material for}} beer production. Several typ es of secondary metabolites present in hops are at the origin of highly characteristic beer flavour attributes, i. e. beer bitterness and ho ppy aroma. Hop-derived beer bitterness is well defined from a chemi cal point of view and, in current brewing practice, beer bitterness can be adequately dosed and controlled because (advanced) hop products with known composition are available, and optimised analytical methods allow reliable quantification of beer bitterness. In sharp contrast with beer bitterness, the precise nature of hoppy aroma of beer is far from comple tely understood. Although it is generally recognised that mainly volatil e constituents present in, or derived from hop essential oil are involve d, hoppy aroma {{is still one of}} the most controversial aspects of beer fl avour. Indeed, flavour-active key compounds causing this highly desirabl e aspect of beer aroma remain to be identified. This gap can be ascribed to the extreme chemical complexity and varietal dependence of hop essen tial oil itself, and to modifications and losses of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> constituents that take place along the brewing process. Obviously, introduction of c onsistent and pleasant hoppy aroma continues to be a serious challenge i n view of obtaining a reproducible and sufficiently stable beer flavour. Whereas conventional hopping inherently leads to flavour inconsistency, currently available <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> products can be adequately dosed at the pos t-fermentation stage in order to attain the desired hoppy aroma or hop-d erived aroma top note in a much more controlled way. In this manner, enh anced consistency of hoppy aroma in the final beer and development of ne w beers with distinct sensory flavour attributes are feasible objectives. However, the spectrum of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> products currently available is rathe r limited (in particular, the varietal aspect of hoppy aroma is not full y exploited), and these products often do not give the intended flavour attributes. From an economic point of view, the above mentioned issues a re highly relevant. Beer flavour consistency is of paramount importance for the modern brewing industry (also because of globalisation of the ma rket) and a too variable hoppy aroma will undoubtedly impair brand typic ality and consumer preference. Beer flavour (in) consistency in respec t of hoppy aroma, together with the unresolved issue of the true nature of hoppy aroma of beer, form the rationale of this PhD study. In general, it aimed at (1) preparation of novel hop aromas extracted directly fro m single hop varieties via supercritical fluid extraction, (2) developme nt and implementation of analytical methodologies for determination of t he volatile composition of the hop aromas and reliable measurement of th e yield of aromatisation of beer with the respective hop essences, (3) d etermination of odour impact compounds of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations, and (4) investigation of the impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character o f pilot beers. First, an extensive literature study is presented (Par t I). An introduction to hops in beer preparation, as well as a comprehe nsive literature review on hop aroma as such and hoppy aroma of beer (th e main topic of this PhD), is provided. The experimental work c omprises 3 different parts (Part II, Part III, and Part IV, respectively), that are all further subdivided into two chapters. In Part II Pro duction of novel varietal hop aromas by supercritical fluid extraction o f hop pellets the unique properties of supercritical carbon dioxide ext raction were evaluated for preparation of different types of varietal ho p aromas from hop pellets. In chapter 1, extraction conditions were opti mised for preparation of single variety total hop essential oils that we re subsequently fractionated by solid phase extraction (SPE), yielding h op oil fractions highly enriched in water-soluble, oxygenated constituen ts (polar hop essences). Next, in chapter 2, a new methodology based on density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and subsequent S PE fractionation of SFE extracts was developed for preparing floral, cit rus, and spicy hop essences. Sensory properties of all novel hop aromas as such, as well as their impact on beer flavour by aromatising referenc e pilot lagers, exclusively bittered with pre-isomerised hop extract, we re clearly demonstrated and described in both chapters of this study. &nb sp;In Part III Comprehensive chemical-analytical and sensory charac terisation of varietal <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations, analytical methods based o n headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and GC-MS were optimis ed and implemented to investigate the volatile composition of varietal f loral and spicy hop essences and total hop essential oils (chapter 3). D etailed analytical characterisation of the typical volatile composition of the different types of (fractionated) hop oils, as well as discrimina tion between varietal hop aromas via principal component analysis, were clearly established. In chapter 4, the focus was on determining odour im pact compounds in floral and spicy hop essences (cv. Spalter Select). By application of advanced gas chromatography in combination with olfactom etric assessment, potent contributors to the odour of floral hop essence were identified and several odour-active regions of hitherto unidentifi ed sesquiterpenoid nature were detected in the aromagram of spicy hop es sence. In Part IV Methodology for determination of hop aromati sation of beer and evaluation of the novel <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations in brewi ng practice, selective determination of hop oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilot lagers was carried out using HS-SPME in co mbination with gas chromatography and advanced mass spectrometry such as tandem MS and selected ion monitoring (chapter 5). This approach allows monitoring the application of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations in beer production and, as a result of this, improved control and specification of hop aroma tisation. Next, in chapter 6, the use of the <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations was in vestigated in brewing practice. In a comparative study, the impact of th e different types of hop aromas on the hoppy character of pilot lagers, as well as on beer flavour stability, was evaluated through both analyti cal and sensory protocols and compared with hoppy character and flavour stability of conventionally hopped pilot lagers. It was found that the c ontent of analytical markers for hoppy aroma (e. g. linalool and oxy genated sesquiterpenoids) as well as the intensity and the qualitative d escription of hoppy aroma, were dependent on the applied hopping technol ogy and on the <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fraction used for beer aromatisation. Interesting ly, sensory evaluation of beer ageing demonstrated that hop aromatisatio n, whether performed in the advanced or the conventional way, significan tly masked beer staling. As a result of our work, an innovative hop aroma technology has bee n developed, allowing the preparation of single variety hop essential oi ls and several refined <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions with pleasant and distinct sens ory attributes. The impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character of pilot lagers was clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, specific analytical and sensory tools were optimised and implemented for detailed character isation of the volatile composition of the novel hop aromas, determinati on of key odour impact compounds in hop essences, and determination of t he yield of aromatisation with the <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations in brewing pract ice. nrpages: 280 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} boiling of hop essential oil in water transforms sesquiterpene hydrocarbons into oxidation products (oxygenated sesquiterpenoids), which impart typical spicy/woody scents associated with “kettle hop” aroma when added to beer. In this study, boiling experiments in water {{as well as}} in wort with increasing <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> (cv. Saaz) concentrations and subsequent headspace solid-phase microextraction GC-MS analysis revealed a positive correlation between the initial added <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> concentration and formation of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. Intervarietal differences were investigated by comprehensive GC-MS fingerprinting of hop-derived volatiles in unboiled and boiled hop essential oils (cv. Hallertau Magnum, Hallertau Tradition, Hallertau Perle, and Saaz) in wort. Unboiled essential oils of European aroma hops were shown to contain significantly higher levels of α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, and sesquiterpene oxidation products compared with cv. Hallertau Magnum. However, changes in the volatile profile upon boiling in wort appeared largely variety independent (i. e., chemically identical α-humulene and β-caryophyllene derivatives were formed). GC–olfactometry further showed that some of these derivatives formed upon boiling (i. e., 6 (5 → 4) -abeocaryophyll- 8 (13) -en- 5 -al, caryophyllene oxide, humulene epoxide III,humulenol II, caryophylla- 4 (12), 8 (13) -diene- 5 α/β-ol, 3 Z-caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 α/β-ol, and 14 -hydroxy-β-caryophyllene) eluted in flavor-active zones. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Terpenoids are {{important}} natural flavour compounds, which {{are introduced to}} beer via hopping. It has been shown recently that yeasts are able to biotransform some monoterpene alcohols. As a first step towards examining whether yeasts are capable of altering hop terpenoids during the brewing of beer, we investigated whether they were transformed when an ale and lager yeast were cultured {{in the presence of}} a commercially available syrup. Both yeasts transformed the monoterpene alcohols geraniol and linalool. The lager yeast also produced acetate esters of geraniol and citronellol.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to determination of hop utilisation {{in terms of}} beer bitterness, analytical measurement of the yield of hop aromatisation is not straightforward {{on account of the}} enormous chemical complexity of hop essential oil and hoppy aroma derived thereof. In this paper, selective determination of hop oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilsner beer is achieved through headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Highly enriched floral and spicy hop essences were prepared by density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), followed by solid phase extraction (SPE), and subsequently added in well-defined amounts to an experimental pilsner, exclusively bittered with purified iso-α-acids extract. In view of reliable measurement of the yield of aromatisation of the pilsner with the respective <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> fractions, characteristic marker components for the floral and spicy SFE/ SPE hop essences, respectively, were selected. Reliable determination of the selected markers for floral and spicy SFE/SPE hop essences in the aromatised beers turned out to be possible on condition that HS-SPME is combined with GC-MS comprising selected fragment ion monitoring (SIM). Using this approach, application of <b>hop</b> <b>oil</b> preparations can be monitored analytically, allowing improved control and specification of hop aromatisation according to the desired beer flavour. The average yield of beer aromatisation using floral and spicy hop essences was determined at about 95 %. On the basis of their sesquiterpenoid GC-MS/SIM pattern, fresh commercial lager beers could be differentiated, which may be useful for brand fingerprinting and identification. Upon forced ageing of the beers, levels of hop oil-derived sesquiterpenoids, in particular of caryophyllene and humulene epoxides, decrease significantly. In addition, trans-nerolidol is identified as a potential marker for measuring flavour (in) stability of pilsner beer. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Determination {{of sensory}} active {{compounds}} in hops using GC-MS Abstract The {{goal of this}} thesis was to determine sensory active compounds from a sample of hops by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric detection. Hop oils were selected for this determination which, despite its low representation in hops, contain up to several hundred components. Hop oils were exctracted using a new method based on fluidized-bed extraction. An integral part of this work was identifying the yield of the method that has become an instrument to defining the content of hop oils in different hop varieties. A comparsion of the obtained extracts with the literature was made and a search was done for the link between chemical structure of the hop oils and their representation in the hops sample with regard to its age.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The German hop Hallertauer, hallertauer {{is highly}} valued {{because of its}} "noble aroma", {{but it has a}} very low yield when {{cultivated}} in the U. S. Two new crosses of Hallertauer, U. S. D. A. 21455 and 21459, have high yields and promising aroma characteristics. In order to predict sensory properties of beers {{as a function of the}} varieties of hop used in brewing, a more complete sensory and chemical characterization of <b>hop</b> <b>oils</b> is necessary. The aims of this study were to compare the aroma profiles of the new crosses against the German variety by determining their most important odor active compounds, and correlating the sensory attributes evaluated by a descriptive sensory panel (DSP) with the odor intensities detected during the gas chromatograph (GC) effluent detected during the gas chromatograph (GC) effluent sniffing. Oxygenated fractions were spiked into spring water and evaluated by the DSP. The same samples were injected into the GC and the effluents were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively by four subjects using a special data collection device. Samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). There were no significant differences among the three varieties based upon the DSP results and the "aromagrams" obtained during the sniffing of the GC effluents. Important odor active peaks were associated with humulene oxidation products. A number of statistical correlations existed between the sensory attributes and the odor active peaks. In summary, the new varieties are potential contributors to "noble aroma". Trials with beers brewed with these hops are underway in order to establish their contribution to beer flavor...|$|R
