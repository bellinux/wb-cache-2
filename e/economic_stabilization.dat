Our results also point out that neither of the fiscal configurations succeeds in optimizing the macroeconomic stabilization of both the demand and supply shocks simultaneously for all the Union members. <b>Economic</b> policy, Macroeconomic <b>Stabilization,</b> <b>Economic</b> Shocks, Structural Heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt at {{assessing}} {{the economic impact of}} market-oriented reforms undertaken during General Franco’s dictatorship, in particular, the 1959 Stabilization and Liberalization Plan. Using an index of macroeconomic distortions (IMD) the relationship between economic policies and the growth record is examined. Although a gradual reduction in macroeconomic distortions was already in motion during the 1950 s, the 1959 Plan opened the way to a new institutional design that favoured a free-market allocation of resources and allowed Spain to accelerate growth and catch up with Western Europe. Without the 1950 s reforms and, especially, the 1959 Plan, per capita GDP would have been significantly lower in 1975 Spain, Franco’s dictatorship, <b>Economic</b> reforms, <b>Stabilization,</b> Liberalization, Growth...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the conception of}} human resource economics (HRE) that shaped the career of Vernon M.

It explains the clash between human capital theory and HRE. And it outlines Briggs’s five dimensions of human resource development (HRD), which is his term for HRE that manifests itself in public policy. Although Briggs developed his conceptualization decades ago, each dimension continues to warrant our attention...|$|R

At the same time, it would appear that the apparent realization that orthodox monetary policy measures have, for various objective reasons, been ineffectual under our conditions has not yet evolved into a clearly defined understanding of which specific regulatory mechanisms in the financial and monetary-credit sphere are most responsive to the tasks of the transitional period. ...|$|R
