5|$|EFS (<b>Embryonal</b> Fyn-associated Substrate), {{also known}} as SIN (Src INteracting or Signal Integrating protein) was {{originally}} identified using cDNA library screening of mouse <b>embryonal</b> libraries for proteins containing SH3-interacting domains, or interacting with the SRC SH3 domain, in two independent studies by Ishino et al. in 1995 and Alexandropoulos et al. in 1996.|$|E
5|$|<b>Embryonal</b> fyn-associated {{substrate}} is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the EFS gene. It {{is also known}} as CASS3.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the <b>embryonal</b> central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (<b>embryonal</b> cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, <b>embryonal</b> {{carcinoma}} appears {{similar to}} the embryonic disc, made up of epithelial, anaplastic cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{experiments}} in the 1920s seemed {{to show that the}} blood–brain barrier (BBB) was still immature in newborns. The reason for this mistake was an error in methodology (the osmotic pressure was too high and the delicate <b>embryonal</b> capillary vessels were partially damaged). It was later shown in experiments with a reduced volume of the injected liquids that the markers under investigation could not pass the BBB. It was reported that those natural substances such as albumin, α-1-fetoprotein or transferrin with elevated plasma concentration in the newborn could not be detected outside of cells in the brain. The transporter P-glycoprotein exists already in the <b>embryonal</b> endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac effects: Oxytocin and {{oxytocin}} receptors {{are also}} found in the heart in some rodents, and the hormone {{may play a role in}} the <b>embryonal</b> development of the heart by promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation. However, the absence of either oxytocin or its receptor in knockout mice has not been reported to produce cardiac insufficiencies.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 John F. Enders, Thomas Weller and Frederick Robbins {{reported}} {{growth of}} poliovirus in cultured human <b>embryonal</b> cells, {{the first significant}} example of an animal virus grown outside of animals or chicken eggs. This work aided Jonas Salk in deriving a polio vaccine from deactivated polio viruses; this vaccine was shown {{to be effective in}} 1955.|$|E
25|$|<b>Embryonal</b> carcinomas, a rare tumor type {{usually found}} in mixed tumors, develop {{directly}} from germ cells {{but are not}} terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further {{into a variety of}} other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.|$|E
25|$|An {{endogenous}} retrovirus (ERV) is a retrovirus whose genome has been permanently {{incorporated into the}} germ-line genome of some organism and that is therefore copied with each reproduction of that organism. It is estimated that about 9 percent {{of the human genome}} have their origin in ERVs. In 2015 it was shown that proteins from an ERV are actively expressed in 3-day-old human embryos and appear {{to play a role in}} <b>embryonal</b> development and protect embryos from infection by other viruses.|$|E
25|$|Introduction of miR-1 and miR-133a into an <b>embryonal</b> rhabdomyosarcoma-derived {{cell line}} is cytostatic, which {{suggested}} a strong tumour-suppressive role for these microRNAs. Expression of miR-1 but not miR-133a gave transcriptional profiles that {{were consistent with}} a strong promyogenic influence on the cells, again demonstrating the role of miR-1 in muscle differentiation from precursor stem cells. The authors propose that miR-1 and miR-133a act to repress isoforms of genes that are not normally expressed in muscle cells. All of these observations suggest that mis-regulation of miR-1 and miR-133a can result in tumorogenesis via abolition of the suppressive effect they have on certain gene targets and of {{the removal of the}} promotion of differentiation of the cells exerted my miR-1.|$|E
500|$|Early <b>embryonal</b> lethality, {{also known}} as early {{embryonic}} death or a non-viable embryo, may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles, or have the homozygous genotype. The {{reason for this is}} that many mutations for W are caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations or DNA deletions, which, if homozygous, would make it impossible to produce a functional KIT protein. [...] However, it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and splice site mutations might be viable because they have less effect on gene function. A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5/W20 heterozygotes, almost completely white, essentially with greater depigmentation than could be accounted for by either allele alone.|$|E
500|$|In the 3'UTR of NEDD9 is a {{match to}} {{positions}} 2-8 of mature miR-145. NEDD9-binding regions in the miR-145 locus would allow the direct binding of the NEDD9 3'UTR to the genomic region of miR-145, and some studies suggests this miR regulates NEDD9 in glioblastoma [...] prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma cells. A non-coding RNA, named B2, extending from 10 kb upstream of NEDD9 exon 1 to exon 4 has been described, but the functional role for this ncRNA is not yet clear. NEDD9 is highly expressed in the <b>embryonal</b> brain, and in numerous tissues in the embryo and adult organism. [...] Elevated expression is associated with cancer, as discussed below.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} protein isoforms of human Efs. hEfs1 and hEfs2 were {{identified}} by Ishino et al. hEFS1 (561 aa) represents the human counterpart of mouse <b>embryonal</b> Efs (mEfs1) originally identified. hEFS1 and mEfs1 are 80% identical in their amino acid sequences and 100% identical within the SH3 domain. [...] hEFS2 (468 aa) is identical to hEFS1, except for its lack of the SH3 domain. hEFS3 (392 aa) also lacks a functional SH3 domain and has the same C-terminus and short N-terminal amino acid tail as the full-length protein. Although little functional analysis of hEFS2 has been performed, speculatively, given lack of an SH3 domain, abundant hEFS2 may inhibit hEFS1 signaling by titrating partner proteins. As of 2015, {{there has been no}} functional analysis of hEFS3.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organisation {{classification}} of testicular tumours subdivides ITGCN into (1) a more common, unspecified type (ITGCNU), and (2) other specific subtypes. [...] The most common specific subtypes are intratubular <b>embryonal</b> carcinoma and intratubular seminoma.|$|E
2500|$|On October 2, 1996, at age 25, Armstrong was {{diagnosed}} with stage three (advanced) testicular cancer (<b>embryonal</b> carcinoma). The cancer had spread to his brain, lungs and abdomen. He visited urologist Jim Reeves in Austin, Texas for diagnosis of his symptoms, including coughing up blood and a swollen testicle. On October 3, Armstrong had an orchiectomy to remove the diseased testicle. Asked in a later interview what he thought Armstrong's chances of survival were, Reeves said [...] "Almost none. We told Lance initially 20 to 50% chance, mainly to give him hope. But {{with the kind of}} cancer he had, with the x-rays, the blood tests, almost no hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|A German {{study on}} {{childhood}} {{cancer in the}} vicinity of nuclear power plants, the KiKK study was published in December 2007. According to Ian Fairlie, it [...] "resulted in a public outcry and media debate in Germany which has received little attention elsewhere". It has been established [...] "partly {{as a result of an}} earlier study by Körblein and Hoffmann which had found statistically significant increases in solid cancers (54%), and in leukemia (76%) in children aged less than 5 within 5 km of 15 German nuclear power plant sites. It red a 2.2-fold increase in leukemias and a 1.6-fold increase in solid (mainly <b>embryonal)</b> cancers among children living within 5 km of all German nuclear power stations." [...] In 2011 a new study of the KiKK data was incorporated into an assessment by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) of the incidence of childhood leukemia around British nuclear power plants. It found that the control sample of population used for comparison in the German study may have been incorrectly selected and other possible contributory factors, such as socio-economic ranking, were not taken into consideration. The committee concluded that there is no significant evidence of an association between risk of childhood leukemia (in under 5 year olds) and living in proximity to a nuclear power plant.|$|E
6000|$|I {{presently}} {{found out}} that he called my pocket compass, [...] "Mbwiri," [...] a very vague and comprehensive word. It represents in the highest signification the Columbian Manitou, and thus men talk of the Mbwiri of a tree or a river; as will presently be seen, it is also applied to a tutelar god; and I have shown how it means a ghost. In [...] "Nágo Mbwiri" [...] the sense is an idol, an object of worship, a [...] "medicine" [...] as the North-American Indians say, in contradistinction to Munda, a grigri, talisman, or charm. Every Mpongwe, woman as well as man, has some Mbwiri to which offerings are made in times of misfortune, sickness, or danger. I afterwards managed to enter one of these rude and <b>embryonal</b> temples so carefully shut. Behind the little door of matting is a tall threshold of board; a bench lines the far end, and in the centre stands [...] "Ologo," [...] a rude imitation of a human figure, with a gum-torch planted in the ground before it ready for burnt offerings. To the walls are suspended sundry mystic implements, especially basins, smeared with red and white chalk-mixture, and wooden crescents decorated with beads and ribbons.|$|E
6000|$|Questions these which {{ought to}} be entertained before we take up the {{arguments}} which have been advanced against this theory. We can barely glance {{at some of the}} considerations which Darwin adduces, or will be sure to adduce in the future and fuller exposition which is promised. To display them in such wise as to indoctrinate the unscientific reader would require a volume. Merely to refer to them in the most general terms would suffice for those familiar with scientific matters, but would scarcely enlighten those who are not. Wherefore let these trust the impartial Pictet, who freely admits that, [...] "in the absence of sufficient direct proofs to justify the possibility of his hypothesis, Mr. Darwin relies upon indirect proofs, the bearing of which is real and incontestable;" [...] who concedes that [...] "his theory accords very well with the great facts of comparative anatomy and zoology--comes in admirably to explain unity of composition of organisms, also to explain rudimentary and representative organs, and the natural series of genera and species--equally corresponds with many paleontological data--agrees well with the specific resemblances which exist between two successive faunas, with the parallelism which is sometimes observed between the series of paleontological succession and of <b>embryonal</b> development," [...] etc.; and finally, although he does not accept the theory in these results, he allows that [...] "it appears to offer the best means of explaining the manner in which organized beings were produced in epochs anterior to our own." ...|$|E
