50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> (or {{computer}} kiosk or interactive kiosk) {{houses a}} computer terminal that often employs custom kiosk software designed to function while preventing users from accessing system functions. Indeed, kiosk mode describes such {{a mode of}} software operation. Computerized kiosks may store data locally, or retrieve it from a computer network. Some computer kiosks provide a free, informational public service, while others serve a commercial purpose (see mall kiosk). Touchscreens, trackballs, computer keyboards, and pushbuttons are all typical input devices for interactive computer kiosk. Touchscreen kiosks are commercially used as industrial appliances, reducing lines, eliminating paper, improving efficiency and service. Their uses are unlimited from refrigerators to airports, health clubs, movie theaters and libraries.|$|E

30|$|Research {{suggests}} that consumers’ evaluations of <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosks</b> in consumer goods stores {{are influenced by}} a number of features. In particular, consumers prefer kiosks that provide information about product assortment, that allow them to place merchandise orders, and that offer multiple options for merchandise delivery (Koller and Kőnigsecker 2012). Although consumer goods retailers have traditionally used <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosks</b> in in-store settings, recently, some retailers have incorporated kiosks into their store exteriors, providing consumers with after-hours access to a variety of retail goods and services. For instance, in 2013 the Kate Spade Saturday concept store in New York City integrated <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosks</b> into its storefronts, allowing consumers to make product purchases and to schedule local deliveries within a one-hour timeframe (Brooke 2013). How consumers respond to “street-side” <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosks</b> at consumer goods retailers—or those that are part of a store’s exterior—is unknown; to date, research examining consumers’ evaluations of <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosks</b> for consumer goods retailers have focused upon in-store applications.|$|R

30|$|MANCOVA also {{revealed}} an interaction effect between landscaping and store greeter (Wilks’ Lambda =  0.97, F =  2.92, p <  0.05). Specifically, {{there was a}} significant interaction effect between landscaping and store greeter on arousal (F =  4.20, p <  0.05). The combination of landscaping and store greeter produced a higher level of arousal among participants (M =  4.64) than did the single effect of store greeter (M =  4.48) or the single effect of landscaping (M =  4.19). Although MANCOVA did not reveal an interaction effect between store greeter and <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> (Wilks’ Lambda =  0.98, F =  2.33, p >  0.05), univariate analyses revealed an interaction effect between these variables on liking of the store (F =  4.26, p <  0.05). That is, the combination of store greeter and <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> produced a lower level of liking (M =  4.25) than the single effect of store greeter (M =  4.57) or the single effect of <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> (M =  5.08).|$|E

30|$|Following the {{approach}} taken by Mower et al. (2012), a manipulation check {{was conducted to}} assess participants’ enjoyment of the manipulated exterior store atmospherics (i.e., the appeal of these atmospherics to participants). The mean score for enjoyment of landscaping features (among participants {{who were exposed to}} stimuli featuring landscaping) was 5.57 (SD =  1.14), the mean score for enjoyment of store greeters (among participants who were exposed to stimuli featuring the store greeter) was 4.95 (SD =  1.21), and the mean score for enjoyment of <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> (among participants who were exposed to stimuli featuring the <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk)</b> was 5.47 (SD =  0.94) (on a seven-point Likert scale). Thus, findings indicated that the presence of these exterior store atmospherics were appealing to the participants.|$|E
30|$|The results {{related to}} the <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> were unexpected, given college students’ proclivity to use SSTs such as self check-outs in retail {{settings}} (Dean, 2008). A managerial implication of this finding is that electronic kiosks in the exterior store environment may provide limited, if any, return on investment {{in the context of}} the university-branded merchandise store. Additional research may confirm this initial conclusion, as limited work has explored this topic.|$|E
50|$|The first {{company to}} launch a statewide {{interactive}} kiosk program was Imperial Multimedia in 2007.

30|$|<b>Electronic,</b> or interactive, <b>kiosks</b> (a.k.a., {{self-service}} technologies, or SSTs) provide consumers increased {{access to}} {{products and services}} {{by allowing them to}} conduct product information searches, register for promotions, obtain loyalty and gift cards, create gift registries, pay bills, and make purchases without assistance from sales personnel (Castro et al. 2010). As such, <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosks</b> offer consumers and retailers, alike, the potential to save time and money in product and service transactions (Bitner et al. 2002; Castro et al. 2010; Koller and Kőnigsecker 2012).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of landscaping, a store greeter, and an <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> upon college students’ responses to a university-branded and owned merchandise store located in a downtown shopping district.

30|$|The {{development}} of stimuli {{for the present}} study was guided by the literature in the area of exterior store atmospherics as well as consideration for the types of exterior store atmospherics that might be appropriate for adoption by independent retailers operating in downtown shopping districts. More specifically, the {{development of}} stimuli for this study reflected feasible options for a university-branded merchandise store situated {{within the context of a}} downtown business district in a college town. Potted yellow flowers with green foliage were selected as the form of landscaping because yellow and green represent the university’s colors. Additionally, potted flowers represent a feasible and affordable landscaping option for locally-owned downtown businesses. The store greeter took the form of a person wearing a university mascot costume to complement the store’s university-branded merchandise focus. Mascots have the ability to effectively communicate the “ethos of a brand” (Malik and Guptha 2014), which is important for a university-branded merchandise store, and also represent a dynamic and flexible design element. The <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> was situated to the right of the storefront door and was described to participants as follows: “The <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> positioned in front of the store allows consumers to engage in a self-service shopping experience. Consumers can use the kiosk to browse and purchase items from the Ram Zone (store name) merchandise assortment as well as to purchase tickets for Ram athletic events at their convenience, 24  h/day. Merchandise purchases are delivered to local addresses within 48  h and to other addresses using standard UPS delivery services.” Prior to administering the survey, a pre-test of the stimuli was conducted with nine college students to assess their observations about and emotional responses to the storefronts including the following manipulations: (a) control, (b) landscaping, only, (c) store greeter, only, and (d) <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk,</b> only. Findings from the pre-test revealed that participants regarded the storefront with the landscaping as “inviting,” “pretty/feminine,” spring-like,” and “welcoming.” Participants described the storefront with the store greeter (i.e., school mascot) as “fun,” “exciting,” eliciting “school pride,” and “youthful.” However, participants also indicated that the presence of the school mascot as store greeter was “not appropriate for all ages” and as possibly “too much.” Participants viewed the storefront featuring the <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> as “advanced/smart,” “modern,” “interactive,” “accessible,” “convenient,” “functional,” “high tech.” At the same time, some participants described the storefront (across the varied conditions) as being “busy” or “crowded.” As such, participants’ pre-test responses included references to the manipulated stimuli as well as culturally-accepted, affective associations with these objects, suggesting that the stimuli were valid for use in the study.|$|E
30|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk</b> did {{not affect}} pleasure, arousal, or liking (Wilks’ Lambda =  1.00, F =  0.52, p >  0.05). Thus, H 3 a, H 3 b, and H 3 c were not supported. All three {{covariates}} were significant in the overall model, and thus, were retained in the model for control purposes (Wilks’ Lambda =  0.97, F =  2.64, p <  0.05 for gender; Wilks’ Lambda =  0.97, F =  3.08, p <  0.05 for preferences for store atmospherics; Wilks’ Lambda =  0.90, F =  11.25, p <  0.001 for university involvement).|$|E

30|$|MANCOVA was {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects}} of three manipulated variables (i.e., landscaping, store greeter, and <b>electronic</b> <b>kiosk)</b> on consumers’ emotional states elicited by the storefront and consumers’ liking of the storefront. Gender, preferences for retail atmospherics, and university involvement were included as covariates in this analysis. These variables were included because research suggests that female consumers may evaluate store design differently from male consumers (Borges et al. 2013) and that consumers’ level of involvement and preferences may affect information processing in the store environment (Sirgy et al. 2000).|$|E
