5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E

Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E

This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|R

In the 1980s, an engineer, Frank Kirk, devised a novel form of frame that was <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> in one piece and composed of I beams rather than tubes. A company, Kirk Precision Ltd, was established in Britain to manufacture both road bike and mountain bike frames with this technology. However, despite some early commercial success, there were problems with reliability and manufacture stopped in 1992.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{pressure}} <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process, a great {{attention is paid}} to a die castings quality improvement. This quality has to be ensured with a great reliability and, at the same time, it is necessary to apply control methods to a technological process which provide a complete picture of a <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process as well as internal quality of the produced die castings. It requires control of the present technological factors of a pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process.

40|$|Abstract: Porosity in the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process causes costly scrap {{loss and}} limits {{the use of}} {{die-cast}} parts in critical high-strength applications. The amount of porosity {{is closely related to}} the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process parameters. Consequently, the mechanisms of porosity formation in relation to <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> parameters have to be studied in detail. A considerable reduction in porosity formation can be obtained by Taguchi technique implementation in the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process. Through simple multifactorial experiments in the foundry, controllable factors can be isolated to provide centring and variance control for a process variable. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the eVects of process parameters on porosity formation in the pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process to improve casting quality. Examples of the oV-line technique used in a Greek aluminium <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> company are given for the purpose of illustrating the practicality and ease of use by industry engineers and managers...|$|R

25|$|First, a core is molded or <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> in {{the shape}} of the cavity {{specified}} for the molded component. It can be made from a low melting point metal, such as a tin-bismuth alloy, or a polymer, such as a soluble acrylate. The polymer has approximately the same melting temperature as the alloy, , however the alloy ratios can be modified to alter the melting point. Another advantage to using a metal core is that multiple smaller cores can be cast with mating plugs and holes so they can be assembled into a final large core.|$|E
25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} {{is used to}} burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel {{is filled with the}} parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> {{industry}} has an imperative {{need for an}} automated or semi-automated approach for <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design. One of the key challenges that die makers face is how to shorten the lead-time to the market and reduce the cost in die design and manufacturing. Most die makers have employed computer aided design (CAD) systems to improve the e¤ciency and quality of die design. However, conventional CAD systems {{do not have the}} functionality specially for the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design, therefore, a speci®c computer aided system for <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design is needed to meet the market demand. This paper describes a prototype system structured by several functional modules as speci®c add-on applications on a commercial CAD system for <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design. These modules include data initialization, cavity layout, gating system design, die-base, parting, standard component design, etc. Focus of the development will be placed on gating, runner and die-base design...|$|R

25|$|The {{coming of}} the {{railways}} and {{the building of the}} fever hospital drove many of the wealthier residents away. The tightly packed Victorian streets provided homes for the clerks and employees of the new purpose built factories (like Berger Paints) being built in the area. From 1937 onwards, the London County Council built mass housing, sweeping away the worst of the slums, but also eliminating many older buildings containing shops on Homerton High Street, effectively destroying it as a commercial area. The Lesney <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> model factory was built in the 1940s on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation, just north of Homerton Road, producing for many years their Matchbox brand. The factory closed in 1990, and was demolished in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E
25|$|The {{lamp housing}} is a metal or plastic {{container}} {{that serves as}} a body for the entire instrument and prevents light from spilling in unwanted directions. It comprises all of the exterior of the fixture except for the lens or opening. The housing may be designed with specific elements that help reduce heat and increase the efficiency of a lamp. Older instruments were made from rolled and machined steel or aluminum. With the advent of the Source Four, many lighting instruments are being made from <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> metal. Die casting allows for one single, light-weight body that is more economical to produce and use. The first lantern to make use of die castings was the Strand Pattern 23 designed by Fred Bentham in 1953, this small mirror spot enjoyed a 30-year production run and found its way into many British schools, halls and theaters. Some instruments are made from plastic, such as the Selecon Pacific.|$|E
