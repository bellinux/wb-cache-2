50|$|For {{space and}} weight-distribution reasons, the {{outboard}} or wing engines were mounted with their output ends facing forward, with power transmitted through Vee-drive gearboxes to the propeller shafts.

50|$|A digital {{tachograph}} system {{consists of a}} digital driver card, the tachograph head, and a sender unit mounted to the vehicle gearbox. The sender unit produces electronic pulses as the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft turns. These pulses are interpreted as speed data by the head.|$|R
50|$|All E30 differentials, small case {{or medium}} case, are interchangeable. The E28 5-Series and E24 6-Series {{shared the same}} differential, {{and can be used}} in the E30 after {{swapping}} the rear cover and <b>output</b> <b>flanges.</b> This provides options for ratios such as 3.25 and 3.46 that wake up the 325e, or provide a proper final drive ratio for engine-swapped cars without overdrive.|$|R
50|$|The {{traction}} motors are three phase asynchronous machines (DTA-1200 model, developed by NEVZ). They are {{suspended in the}} bogies and decoupled from the non-rotational motions of the driving wheels. The connection between motor and reduction gear is via a diaphram coupling, and the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> drives a hollow shaft connected to the axle via a flexible coupling.|$|R
30|$|The <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> axial-torque is {{composed}} of suspension load torque, balance torque, walking beam inertial torque and crank inertial torque. When the working velocity changes, the computing formula generally cannot ignore the influent of walking beam inertia and crank inertia.

40|$|The {{auxiliary}} power unit (APU) for the space shuttle is required to provide hydraulic and electrical power on board the booster and orbiter vehicles. Five systems and their associated components, which utilize hot gas turbines to supply horsepower at <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> pads, were studied. Hydrogen-oxygen and storable propellants were considered for the hot gas supply. All APU's were required to be self contained with respect to dissipating internally generated heat. These five systems were evaluated relative to a consistent criteria. The system supplied with high pressure gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was recommended as the best approach. It included a two-stage pressure-compounded partial-admission turbine, a propellant conditioning system with recuperation, a control system, and a <b>gearbox.</b> The <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> used was 240 HP.

40|$|Research to {{correlate}} bearing {{remaining useful life}} (RUL) predictions with Helicopter Health Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) condition indicators (CI) to indicate the damage state of a transmission component has been developed. Condition indicators were monitored and recorded on UH- 60 M (Black Hawk) tail <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft thrust bearings, which {{had been removed from}} helicopters and installed in a bearing spall propagation test rig. Condition indicators monitoring the tail <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft thrust bearings in UH- 60 M helicopters were also recorded from an on-board HUMS. The spal-lpropagation data collected in the test rig was used to generate condition indicators for bearing fault detection. A damage progression model was also developed from this data. Determining the RUL of this component in a helicopter requires the CI response to be mapped to the damage state. The data from helicopters and a test rig were analyzed to determine if bearing remaining useful life predictions could be correlated with HUMS condition indicators (CI). Results indicate data fusion analysis techniques can be used to map the CI response to the damage levels...|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft. To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In {{many modern}} designs, the engine {{sits in front}} of the gearbox. From a {{sprocket}} {{on one side of the}} crankshaft, a chain or sprocket directly mounted to the clutch will drive the clutch, which can often be found behind a large circular cover on one side of the gearbox.

50|$|A limited {{production}} {{version of}} the WR450F was the WR450F 2-Trac, which featured 2-wheel drive. The <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> sprocket drove a short, fully enclosed chain to a pump, which in turn pushed the oil to the front hub via the pipe and back via the parallel pipe. A maximum of 15% of the power was transmitted to the front wheel at any time. Yamaha planned on building 250 2-Tracs in 2004, {{but only a few}} were built, which were used for enduro racing. 2006 was the last year of the steel frames.|$|R
50|$|The {{power train}} from the four-speed gearbox {{to the two}} rear wheels was also unusual: fixed to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> drive was {{something}} called a Hardy disc, which was a cardan joint made of rubber. On {{the other side of}} it was a cardan shaft, and finally a second Hardy disc, which in turn was located at the entrance to a chain case. A duplex chain running in an oil bath led finally to a rigid shaft, at each end of which were the two rear wheels. Thanks to this elaborate power transfer, the engine-gearbox unit was both free of tension and well soundproofed in its linkage to the rear axle.|$|R
50|$|The system {{features}} an oil pressure operated device {{attached to the}} back of the standard gearbox operating on the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft. Through a system of oil pressure, solenoids and pistons, the overdrive would drop the revs on whatever gears it was used on by 22% (.778). For instance, the overdrive system applied to a Triumph TR5 operates on 2nd, 3rd and top gear. When engaged, the overdrive would drop the revs from 3000 by 666 RPM, or from 3500 the drop would be 777 RPM to 2723 net. The advantages this reduced rpm had on fuel consumption was most often quite near 22% decrease during highway driving.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the early}} {{development}} {{of cars and}} the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The gearbox was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a [...] "direct-drive" [...] or [...] "straight-through" [...] 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a gearbox ratio even higher than this, i.e. the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft rotating faster than the engine. The propeller shaft linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an [...] "overdrive" [...] transmission.|$|R
50|$|Porsche {{revealed}} {{basic information}} on the 991 Carrera and Carrera S on 23 August 2011. The Carrera {{is powered by a}} 350 hp (257 kW) 3.4-litre engine. The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine producing 400 hp (294 kW). A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power to 430 hp. The new 991s overall length grows by 2.2 inches and wheelbase grows by 3.9 inches (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward roughly 3 in. toward the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose <b>output</b> <b>flanges</b> are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track (2.0 inches wider for the Carrera S). The design team was headed by Michael Mauer.|$|R

5000|$|The engine gave {{maximum power}} at 7,500 rpm (the rotors turning at only 2,500rpm), but a 2.96:1 {{reduction}} gearbox (closely {{based on that}} in the Hewland AE75 engine) gave a maximum propeller rotation of an efficient 2,500 rpm. [...] Unlike the Hewland's <b>gearbox,</b> where the <b>output</b> shaft and propellor flange was below the crankshaft, the MidWest's <b>gearbox</b> had its <b>output</b> shaft higher than the eccentric shaft.

40|$|An {{automotive}} {{drive shaft}} {{is used in}} a front drive transmission vehicle for transmitting rotary movement from the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft to the wheels with a constant velocity. This paper presents the kinematic model of ball joint and tripod joint with consideration of clearance and proposes a simplified dynamics model of the drive shaft. The simulation of the dynamics model is given by the measured data. Also, the abrasive wear of the ball type joint is tested on the experimental setup with consideration of full loading. The {{results show that the}} dynamics of the motion will be affected by the clearance when the loading changes its direction. The motion will be stable due to the damping. It can be found that the abrasive wear of ball joint largely depends on the relative sliding velocity from the experiments.

40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} {{and experimental}} validation tests {{were performed on}} a two-stage, two-speed gearbox {{as part of the}} drive system research activities of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Subsonics Rotary Wing Project. The gearbox was driven by two electromagnetic motors and had two electromagnetic, multi-disk clutches to control output speed. A dynamic model of the system was created which included a direct current electric motor with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) speed control, a two-speed gearbox with dual electromagnetically actuated clutches, and an eddy current dynamometer. A six degree-of-freedom model of the gearbox accounted for the system torsional dynamics and included gear, clutch, shaft, and load inertias as well as shaft flexibilities and a dry clutch stick-slip friction model.

50|$|Input and <b>output</b> shaft <b>flanges</b> are {{bolted to}} the giubo on either side using {{alternating}} hole positions, so that the flanges are not connected directly to one another but instead only through the rubber material of the coupling. The elasticity of the rubber absorbs vibration and flexes for alignment. It follows that the rubber must withstand the application's full transmitted torque, for which reason the rubber is often reinforced internally using moulded-in fibre material.|$|R
50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft.|$|R
