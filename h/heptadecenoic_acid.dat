40|$|AbstractThe {{qualitative}} {{characteristics of}} four monovarietal olive oils produced in Calabria region (Southern Italy) were evaluated. The {{aim of this}} work was to evidence the differences on chemical parameters due to variety and to growing environment. Results demonstrated a large variability in qualitative indexes according to the variety. Most of the Grossa di Gerace oils sampled in Ionian Southern coast revealed a high total acidity (percentage upper 0. 8 % of oleic acid). Fatty acid composition showed some varietal characters: in Grossa di Gerace oils possessed a low content of oleic acid and many Carolea oils showed a <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> level higher than 0. 3 % as European Rules requires for the {{extra virgin olive oil}} category. Carolea cultivar is widely grown in different sites of Calabria and so it is influenced by the different climatic conditions: the obtained oils strongly differed according to the production area...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of the blue-green alga, Anacystis nidulans, was investigated by gas-liquid chromatography at four different growth temperatures with illumination, aeration, cell density, medium composition, and growth rate kept constant. At all temperatures palmitic acid and a hexadecenoic acid presumed to be palmitoleic totaled approximately 90 % of the fatty acids present but {{the ratio of the}} hexedecenoic to palmitic decreased as the temperature was raised. An octadecenoic and tetradecenoic (probably oleic and myristoleic, respectively) were also present and traces of a <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> and of others were detected. At 26 [deg], 32 [deg], and 35 [deg], the ratio of total unsaturated to saturated acids remained approximately 1 [middle dot] 0 although the qualitative composition changed, but at 41 [deg] the saturated acids predominated, the ratio being 0 [middle dot] 7. In contrast to other algae and higher plants, polyunsaturated acids were absent in Anacystis which in this way resembles the photosynthetic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The product {{distribution}} of Brevibacterium ammoniagenes fatty acid synthetase {{has been investigated}} using propionyl-CoA instead of acetyl-CoA as the primer. The synthetase produces not only an odd-numbered fatty acid (heptadecanoic acid) but also even-numbered fatty acids (stearic and oleic acids) {{in the presence of}} propionyl-CoA. The amounts of heptadecanoic, stearic and oleic acids increased with increas-ing concentration of propionyl-CoA. However, the formation of <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (Ci 7 :l) was not observed under any conditions tested. The failure of C 17 !l synthesis suggested that the enzyme component catalyzing the fty-dehydration, which is responsible for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, has a high degree of chain length specificity. Under standard assay conditions, stearic acid predom-inated and heptadecanoic and oleic acids were found in lesser amounts. Mass spectrometric analyses of fatty acids synthesized either from [2 H]propionyl-CoA or in 2 H 2 O revealed that propionyl-CoA is utilized as the priming substrate for the synthesis of heptadecanoic acid and that an acetyl residues, which is formed by the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA, served as the priming substrate for the synthese...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the lipid {{constituents}} of Penicillium atrovenetum were studied during {{the growth and}} development of this fungus. The stages in development, {{as measured by the}} dry weight, were divided into four phases: lag, log, stationary, and death. The total fatty acids on a dry-weight basis increased from a minimum in the spores to a maximum {{near the end of the}} log phase of growth. The major fatty acids were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic. Myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitoleic, heptadecanoic, linolenic, arachidic, and <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acids,</b> together with two unidentified components, were also present in the fatty acid fraction. Compared to ungerminated spores, young mycelium contained a much lower percentage (on the basis of total fatty acids) of linoleic acid. There was a corresponding increase of oleic acid. Except for palmitic acid, which remained constant, the remaining fatty acids increased slightly. During subsequent growth of the fungus, linleic acid decreased, whereas the percentage of palmitic and stearic acids increased steadily from the lag phase to the end of the log phase. Ergosterol was the only sterol detected. The percentage of ergosterol, on a dry-weight basis, increased to a maximum at the start of the log phase and then steadily decreased. The following changes in lipids appear to be associated with the development and aging of fungi: (i) the presence of a relatively high content of nonsaponifiable lipid and ergosterol in the young mycelium, and their later decrease with age, and (ii) a shift from more unsaturated to less unsaturated fatty acids with age...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effect of forages with different nutritional values - specifically, corn silage (CS), sugar cane (SC), and sugar cane bagasse (SB) - in diets with crude glycerin, on carcass traits, meat quality, and fatty acid profile, using young Nellore bulls finished in the feedlot. Thirty young Nellore bulls with an initial average body weight of 416. 70 ± 24. 74 kg were randomly assigned to three treatments containing different sources of forage. The carcass traits and variables related to meat quality of the Nellore young bulls were not significantly influenced by different sources of forage in diets with crude glycerin. The yellow color index was significantly greater in the fat of animals fed corn silage. <b>Heptadecenoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> was significantly lower in the meat of animals fed sugar cane bagasse. The sources of forage in diets with crude glycerin did not influence the profile of saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fatty acids in the longissimus muscle. Overall, our results indicate that none of the treatments changed the carcass and meat quality traits of Nellore young bulls finished in the feedlot. Thus, sugar cane and sugar cane bagasse could be used in feedlot as a viable forage alternative to corn silage...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} utilizing unusual carbon sources by three yeast strains: Candida krusei DBM 2136, Trichosporon cutaneum CCY 30 - 5 - 10, and Yarrowia lipolytica CCY 30 - 26 - 36. These strains are characterized by high biomass yield, ability to accumulate high amounts of lipids, and their potential as producers of dietetically important fatty acids. The aim of this work was the production of nutritionally important fatty acids by utilization of n-alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms, alone and in combination with glucose and subsequent analysis of microbial lipids accumulation and fatty acid profile. All three yeast strains were able to grow and produce high amounts of the fatty acids of interest. Yarrowia lipolytica was found as the most suitable strain for the growth on n-alkanes (n-pentadecane and n-heptadecane) as {{the only source of}} carbon. The addition of biosurfactants rhamnolipids into the cultivation increased the ratio of <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (up to 17. 9 % of total FAs in Y. lipolytica CCY 30 - 26 - 36, 14. 9 % in T. cutaneum CCY 30 - 5 - 10, and 17. 5 % in C. krusei DBM 2136) and the total biomass yield. The results show that, by manipulation of the initial cultivation conditions, the ratio of important fatty acids may be increased...|$|E
40|$|Monovarietal {{olive oils}} from the Molise region (Central Italy), {{obtained}} from Gentile di Larino and Oliva nera di Colletorto cultivars, {{were characterized by}} sensory and chemical analyses. The influences of the genetic factor (cultivar) on olive oil composition was investigated by gaschromatographic analysis of fatty chains, spectrophotometric analysis of phenols, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (NMR) {{as well as through}} quality parameters such as free acidity, peroxide value and UV spectrophotometric indices. To avoid misinterpretation, we used general linear model analysis (GLM) to adjust the result obtained from the analysis of variance (ANOVA). In this way, the genetic effect was corrected for the crop year effect, which in turn might influence the variable under investigation. The weight of two factors was evaluated by variance component analysis (VCA). Finally, we performed multivariate statistical analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA). All samples were grouped {{on the basis of their}} cultivar. The value of free acidity, sn 1, 2 diglycerides, saturated fatty chains, total phenols, green and bitter attributes were higher in the olive oils obtained from Gentile di Larino, whereas the levels of unsaturated fatty chains, palmitoleic acid (C 16 : 1), heptadecanoic acid (C 17 : 0), <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 17 : 1) as well as K 270 parameter were higher in the oil obtained from Oliva nera di Colletorto...|$|E
40|$|Medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters having {{properties}} of biodegradable thermoplastics and elastomers that are naturally {{produced by a}} variety of pseudomonads. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was transformed with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PHAC 1 synthase modified for peroxisome targeting by the addition of the carboxyl 34 amino acids from the Brassica napus isocitrate lyase. The PHAC 1 gene was put {{under the control of the}} promoter of the catalase A gene. PHA synthase expression and PHA accumulation were found in recombinant S. cerevisiae growing in media containing fatty acids. PHA containing even-chain monomers from 6 to 14 carbons was found in recombinant yeast grown on oleic acid, while odd-chain monomers from 5 to 15 carbons were found in PHA from yeast grown on <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The maximum amount of PHA accumulated was 0. 45 % of the dry weight. Transmission electron microscopy of recombinant yeast grown on oleic acid revealed the presence of numerous PHA inclusions found within membrane-bound organelles. Together, these data show that S. cerevisiae expressing a peroxisomal PHA synthase produces PHA in the peroxisome using the 3 -hydroxyacyl coenzyme A intermediates of the beta-oxidation of fatty acids present in the media. S. cerevisiae can thus be used as a powerful model system to learn how fatty acid metabolism can be modified in order to synthesize high amounts of PHA in eukaryotes, including plants...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to characterize the}} fatty acid profile and sensory properties of longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of Boer kids as affected by sex (17 male, 15 female) and slaughter weight (pre-weaned 20 kg, post-weaned 30 kg). Regarding sex differences, higher percentage amounts of lauric, myristic, pentadecanoic, linolenic and docosapentaenoic acids were found in LD muscle of male compared to female kids, whereas greater amounts of oleic acid were detected in LD muscle of female kids. Also, LD of male kids contained higher percentage amounts of saturated (SFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFA) while higher amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were detected in LD of female kids. Regarding slaughter weight, percentage amounts of lauric, myristic, margaric, pentadecanoic, linolenic, linoleic, arachidonic and docosapentaenoic acids significantly decreased with age (P≤ 0. 001), while percentage amounts of <b>heptadecenoic</b> and oleic <b>acids</b> significantly increased (P≤ 0. 001). LD muscle from lighter kids contained higher percentage amounts of SFA and PUFA, while heavier kids had higher percentage amounts of MUFA and n- 3 /n- 6 fatty acid ratio. Except meat colour, sensory traits (marbling, off-odour, flavour, juiciness and tenderness) were neither significantly affected by sex nor slaughter age...|$|R
40|$|The taxonomic {{position}} of a chlorophenol-degrading bacterium, strain S 37 T, was investigated. The 16 S rDNA sequence indicated that this strain belongs to the genus Sphingopyxis, exhibiting high sequence similarity to the 16 S rDNA sequences of Sphingomonas alaskensis LMG 18877 T (98 · 8  %), Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida LMG 17324 T (98 · 2  %), Sphingopyxis terrae IFO 15098 T (95  %) and Sphingomonas adhaesiva GIFU 11458 T (92  %). These strains (except Sphingopyxis terrae IFO 15098 T, which was not investigated) and the novel isolate accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoates consisting of 3 -hydroxybutyric acid and 3 -hydroxyvaleric acid from glucose as carbon source. The G+C content of the DNA of strain S 37 T was 65 · 5 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids of this strain were octadecenoic acid (18  :  1 ω 7 c), <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (17  :  1 ω 6 c) and hexadecanoic acid (16  :  0). The results of DNA–DNA hybridization experiments and its physiological characteristics clearly distinguished the novel isolate from all known Sphingopyxis species and indicated that the strain represents a novel Sphingopyxis species. Therefore, the species Sphingopyxis chilensis sp. nov. is proposed, with strain S 37 T (=LMG 20986 T =DSM 14889 T) as the type strain. The transfer of Sphingomonas alaskensis to the genus Sphingopyxis as Sphingopyxis alaskensis comb. nov. is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|From 15 marine sponges {{harvested}} at the Adriatic {{coast and}} in the Aegean Sea, respectively, we have isolated approximately 150 different bacteria. After cultivation and screening for novel natural compounds we have focussed on three bacteria, which showed interesting results in antimicrobial assays. The bacteria were identified by 16 S rDNA technology and the molecular structures of the products were elucidated: Pseudoalteromonas piscicida from Crella rosea was able to synthesize hexadecenoic acid and <b>heptadecenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> resp., which were active against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Besides amino acid degradation compounds, Microbacterium spec. from Halichondria panicea produced a novel glycoglyerolipid. In the case of Staphylococcus hominis from Halichondria cratera unsaturated fatty acids were detected as antimicrobially acting substances. As for all three bacteria, intensive studies on the optimization of growth and natural compound production were carried out in 10 l - 50 l bioreactors. Up to 200 mg l"-" 1 of pure active substances have been producted. To dominat glycoglycerolipid GGL. 2 and its corresponding hydrolysis product (from alkaline treatment) showed good antitumoral properties; they inhibited the TPA induced activation of the Epstein-Barr-virus early antigen (EBV-EA). These compounds {{as well as the}} previously mentioned natural products were able to inhibit protein kinases too, but in a nonspecific manner. Some of the microbial crude products showed NMDA antagonistic effects in the [" 3 H]-MK 801 binding assay, other raw materials indicated cytotoxic effects on the tumoral cell line L 5178 Y. In the future it is necessary to use chromatographically enriched products for these studies. (orig.)
