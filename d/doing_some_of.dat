5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

500|$|After the climb, the peloton {{lifted the}} pace and cut into the leaders' advantage, {{trimming}} off two minutes within the space of [...] Engoulvent left his two breakaway companions behind with [...] remaining, as [...] hit {{the front of the}} peloton, this time with points classification leader Tom Boonen <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the legwork. Engoulvent held his slim lead through the intermediate sprint at Peyrat-le-Château, before being engulfed by the field with [...] to go. [...] rider Sergey Lagutin attacked with [...] to go– just as team-mate Lieuwe Westra did the previous day– but was unsuccessful, and was eventually caught just before the final kilometre of the stage. Westra attacked but was covered off immediately, setting up the uphill sprint to the line.|$|E
500|$|Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy praised Rihanna's vocals on {{the song}} and {{referred}} to it as a [...] "most poignant offering on the record". The Star-Ledgers reviewer labelled the song as [...] "staggering power ballad that makes all her other mid-tempo numbers sound featherweight by comparison." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic praised [...] "What Now" [...] and called it a [...] "massive, slamming, wailing power ballad". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times positively reviewed the song writing, [...] "Rihanna is <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her most direct, ambitious singing here. It’s the album’s one real purge, and a sign of a pulse beneath the armor." [...] Genevieve Koski for The A.V. Club criticised [...] "What Now", writing that it (as well as [...] "Stay") are the types of [...] "milquetoast ballads" [...] which have never been Rihanna's speciality.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Team" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said he {{was enjoying}} the new paper company storyline and that [...] "Dream Team" [...] was funnier than [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company". Sepinwall said the final scene with Michael trying to comfort Pam in the car was a [...] "good payoff" [...] which was well acted by Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer, and [...] "yet another reminder that Michael does know what he's <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the time, which means Pam wasn't a complete idiot for following him out the door." [...] He also liked Kevin's struggle with the phones in the beginning, but said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and, [...] "It would help if the writers ever gave Idris Elba something funny to do." [...] Steven Mullen of The Tuscaloosa News called the episode [...] "stellar", said the Charles Miner soccer subplot ended [...] "perfectly" [...] and said, [...] "Watching [...] fears bubble beneath the surface and slowly erode Pam's confidence was a masterwork." ...|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of brass}} marching bands came long before jazz music through {{their use in}} the military, though in New Orleans many of the best-known musicians had their start in brass marching bands {{performing}} dirges as well as celebratory and upbeat tunes for New Orleans jazz funeral processions from the 1890s onward. The tradition drove onward with musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Henry [...] "Red" [...] Allen and King Oliver.

2500|$|Speaking {{before an}} anti-abortion group in 2013, Marshall criticized the 2013 Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's {{majority}} opinion which ruled the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. [...] Marshall asserted that [...] "For all I know, Kennedy’s a homosexual. [...] You can’t be <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these things without {{this kind of}} conclusion." [...] In 2014, Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen ruled in Bostic v. Schaefer the relevant laws passed in 1997, 2004, and 2006 prohibiting same-sex marriage in Virginia were unconstitutional. In 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled the prohibition of same-sex marriage was unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges and state legislation was subsequently introduced in 2015 and 2016 to repeal the prohibition of same-sex marriage (SB 10, HB 1395, SB 782).|$|E
2500|$|In Kansas City Bomber Raquel Welch {{played a}} {{hardened}} derby star and single mother {{that tries to}} balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. Life dubbed Welch the “hottest thing on wheels” for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in Bluebeard (1972) opposite Richard Burton. Although Kansas City Bomber was not considered a critical success, it vividly depicted gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: [...] "You have all those women out there, but {{the men in the}} front office are really running it. Which I thought was a really nice metaphor for the way a lot of women felt about their lives at that time." ...|$|E
