40|$|When {{a content}} {{provider}} (CP) provides peer-topeer live streaming service, routing decisions {{with the knowledge}} of underlay traffic can often lead to much better performance (such as user delay). On the other hand, if the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide underlay traffic information to the CP, their overall <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> due to routing inefficiencies can be reduced. There is hence incentive for ISP-CP collaboration. In this paper, we study protocol design to reduce <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> for such collaboration. We consider two ways of collaboration: one on complete information sharing (i. e., the case of ISPs playing the role of CP), and the other one on limited information sharing by means of peer ranking (i. e., the case of P 4 P framework through Oracle/iTracker). We first formulate the problem of minimizing <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> with a certain delay target, and show that it is NP-hard. For complete information sharing, we propose a centralized heuristic which achieves low <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> For limited information sharing, we present a simple distributed algorithm called Coppice (Collaborative ISP-CP live streaming service) which achieves low <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> Simulation results show that indeed there is a strong benefit for ISP-CP collaboration, and substantial performance can be gained if ISPs can share complete network information with CP. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Overlay routing {{has been}} {{successful}} as an incremental method to improve Internet routing by allowing its own users to select their logical routing. In the meantime, traffic engineering (TE) {{are being used to}} reduce the whole <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> by adapting physical routing in response to varying traffic patterns. Previous studies [1, 2] have shown that the interaction of the two network components can cause huge <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> increases and oscillations. In this paper, we improve the interaction between overlay routing and TE by modifying the objectives of both parties. For the overlay part, we propose TE-awareness which limits the selfishness by some bounds so that the action of overlay does not offensively affect TE’s optimization process. Then, we suggest COPE [3] as a strong candidate that achieves close-to-optimal performance for predicted traffic matrices and that handles unpredictable overlay traffic efficiently. With extensive simulation results, we show the proposed methods can significantly improve the interaction with lower <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> and smaller oscillation problems. ...|$|R

40|$|BitTorrent, {{a popular}} Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) protocol, has {{recently}} engendered considerable controversy. Many P 2 P applications implement {{a variant of}} the protocol due to its cost-effective scalability. However, for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) the protocol is notorious for its high <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> To reduce these costs, ISPs have deployed network devices to detect and throttle BitTorrent traffic. In response, application developers have begun encrypting the protocol's traffic to avoid ISP-detection. These actions perpetuate a "cat and mouse " game between ISPs and developers. Recent proposals to reduce BitTorrent's <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> involve either changing the protocol or deploying ISP-managed services. These proposals require broad adoption by developers to significantly benefit ISPs.

Moreover, ANT requires no explicit communication between client applications and ISPs. It inspects packets on the wire to identify BitTorrent traffic to discover local peers sharing similar files.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} a generic <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> {{minimization}} problem, {{in which every}} node has a local decision vector to determine. Each node incurs a cost depending on its decision vector and each link also incurs a cost depending on the decision vectors of its two end nodes. All nodes cooperate to minimize the overall <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> The formulated <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> minimization problem has broad applications in distributed signal processing and control over multi-agent systems. To obtain a decentralized algorithm for the formulated problem, we resort to the distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (DADMM). However, each iteration of the DADMM involves solving a local optimization problem at each node, leading to intractable computational burden in many circumstances. As such, we propose a distributed linearized ADMM (DLADMM) algorithm for <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> minimization. In the DLADMM, each iteration only involves closed-form computations and avoids local optimization problems, which greatly reduces the computational complexity compared to the DADMM. We prove that the DLADMM converges to an optimal point when the local cost functions are convex and have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Linear convergence rate of the DLADMM is also established if the local cost functions are further strongly convex. Numerical experiments are conducted to corroborate {{the effectiveness of the}} DLADMM and we observe that the DLADMM has similar convergence performance as DADMM does while the former enjoys much lower computational overhead.

40|$|Abstract—Multicast routing {{is to find}} a tree {{which is}} rooted from a source node and {{contains}} all multicast destinations. There are two requirements of multicast routing in many multimedia applications: optimal <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> and bounded delay. The net-work cost of a tree is defined as the sum of the cost of all links in the tree. The bounded delay of a routing tree refers to the feature that the accumulated delay from the source to any destination along the tree shall not exceed a prespecified bound. This paper presents a distributed heuristic algorithm which generates routing trees having a suboptimal <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> under the delay bound constraint. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed, efficient {{in terms of the number}} of messages and convergence time, and flexible in dynamic membership changes.
