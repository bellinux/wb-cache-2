5000|$|High {{generator}} output resistance: In {{order to}} get voltage output levels in the range required by digital electrical devices, a common approach is to place many thermoelectric elements in series within a <b>generator</b> <b>module.</b> The element's voltages add, but so do their individual output resistance. The maximum power transfer theorem dictates that maximum power is delivered to a load when the source and load resistances are identically matched. For low impedance loads near zero ohms, as the generator resistance rises the power delivered to the load decreases. To lower the output resistance, some commercial devices place more individual elements in parallel and fewer in series and employ a boost regulator to raise the voltage to the voltage needed by the load.|$|E

50|$|Of {{particular}} interest to the SOFC-based IGFC power system is catalytic coal gasification, because of the characteristically high methane content of its resultant syngas. This process experienced development in the 1980s for synthetic natural gas production purposes. Compared to conventional gasification summarized above, a catalytic gasifier would require less oxygen input, run at a lower process temperature, and produce a syngas stream with a higher methane concentration (vol), in addition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. With its lower operating temperature, a relatively high cold gas efficiency of at least 90% is projected for catalytic gasification, and this characteristic, {{as well as the}} process need for less oxygen input, would directly support high-efficiency IGFC power system operation. Furthermore, internal reformation of the substantial methane content of its syngas within the SOFC module can be used by design to assist module cooling, and can thereby lead to reductions in the parasitic power demand associated with cooling air supply.The SOFC electric power <b>generator</b> <b>module</b> in an IGFC system could conceivably be fueled with syngas supplied by any of the available conventional coal gasifiers, and studies indicate that power system electric efficiencies in the 45-50% range are achievable, depending on whether the power system uses atmospheric-pressure or pressurized SOFC modules. However, from the efficiency viewpoint particularly, the preferred coal gasification approach for the application is catalytic. Using that technology, IGFC system efficiencies in 56-60% range are projected, again depending on SOFC module pressurization. Estimates and comparisons are tabulated below.† The efficiency estimates include the effects of parasitic power loads due to CO2 compression for carbon sequestration/storage.|$|E
