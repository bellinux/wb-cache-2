5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders <b>Identification</b> <b>Test</b> (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

Identification of talented throwers would enable prediction of future success and promote participation; however, a {{valid and reliable}} talent identification battery for Paralympic throwing has not been reported. This study evaluates {{the reliability and validity}} of a talent identification battery for Paralympic throws. Participants were non-disabled so that impairment would not confound analyses, and results would provide an indication of normative performance. Twenty-eight non-disabled participants (13 M; 15 F) aged 23. 6 years (± 5. 44) performed five kinematically distinct criterion throws (three seated, two standing) and nine talent <b>identification</b> <b>tests</b> (three anthropometric, six motor); 23 were tested a second time to evaluate test–retest reliability. Talent identification test–retest reliability was evaluated using Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland–Altman plots (Limits of Agreement). Spearman’s correlation assessed strength of association between criterion throws and talent <b>identification</b> <b>tests.</b> Reliability was generally acceptable (mean ICC = 0. 89), but two seated talent <b>identification</b> <b>tests</b> require more extensive familiarisation. Correlation strength (mean rs = 0. 76) indicated that the talent <b>identification</b> <b>tests</b> can be used to validly identify individuals with competitively advantageous attributes for each of the five kinematically distinct throwing activities.

"The contribution of internal (eyes, nose and mouth) and external (hair‐line, cheek and jawline) features across eyewitness <b>identification</b> <b>tests</b> was examined using eye tracking. In Experiment 1, participants studied faces and were tested with lineups, either simultaneous (test faces presented in an array) or sequential (test faces presented one at a time). In Experiment 2, the recognition of previously studied faces was tested in a showup (a suspect face alone was presented). Results indicated that foils were analysed for a shorter period of time in the simultaneous compared to the sequential condition, whereas a positively identified face was analysed for a comparable period of time across lineup procedures. In simultaneous lineups and showups, a greater proportion of time was spent analysing internal features of the test faces compared to sequential lineups.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether results from cued odor <b>identification</b> <b>tests</b> {{are influenced by}} the number of verbal descriptors presented with each odor and whether a larger number of descriptors would improve the differentiation between individuals with various degrees of olfactory loss. Design: Randomized, crossover study. Setting: University Clinic in Brussels. Participants: Two hundred thirty-eight study participants (128 with olfactory concerns and 110 control individuals without such concerns). The study took place from March 1, 2008, to April 30, 2009. Main Outcome Measures: Results of the 3 -alternative forced choice (AFC) and 6 -AFC <b>identification</b> <b>tests,</b> which consisted of 32 odor items each. Results: A high correlation was found between the results obtained with the 2 tests. Although no sex-related differences were present, age was found to interact with performance in that lower test scores were obtained for older participants with the 6 -AFC test, compared with the 3 -AFC test. Of the 2 tests, the 6 -AFC better separated participants with self-assessed olfactory deficits from participants without such concerns. It also discriminated more strongly between posttraumatic and postviral and sinonasal underlying causes of olfactory loss. Conclusions: Cued odor <b>identification</b> <b>tests</b> With various numbers of verbal descriptors produce similar results.
