5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, lengthened it. The three-man superior court which heard her case overturned {{one aspect of}} her conviction—charges of attempted robbery—but upheld her murder conviction and increased her sentence from ten to thirteen years, saying that her original sentence <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> lenient.|$|E
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

30|$|In Pt 1, {{the mean}} {{activity}} concentration decreased with increasing masses, but CVs and SKs {{did not follow}} the expected trend. These {{results indicate that the}} mass groups probably <b>were</b> <b>too</b> wide and mean masses may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> large. Mass homogeneity of each mass group thus appears statistically important; furthermore, the number of biopsies might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> low.|$|R
5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> badly hurt {{to fight a}} {{continuing}} action the following day. He {{knew exactly what he}} was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E

5|$|Legler {{held the}} record {{for well over a}} year. As 2000 ended and 2001 began, the {{producers}} of Millionaire decided that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> long (71 games over a five-month period) since their top prize had been won, and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added $10,000 to the grand prize amount for each game it was not won. Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10, 2001, winning a jackpot of $2,180,000. Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2,000,000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all-time leader.|$|E
5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> {{great for}} the advance posts of the much-reduced Yeomanry Mounted Division, which fell back down the Wadi Zeit but the pursuing Ottoman force was suddenly blocked by the 11th Light Horse Regiment of 4th Light Horse Brigade. The 4th Light Horse Brigade had moved by the same route as the 7th Mounted Brigade, but near El Burj they found the road blocked by fire. Brigadier General Grant, reporting to Barrow, ordered the brigade south of Beit Ur el Tahta to support the 6th Mounted Brigade. The 11th Light Horse Regiment was pushed forward with two machine guns to hold Wadi Zeit south west of Beit Ur el Foqa.|$|E

5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than {{everyone else in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|When the Geneva Conference in July 1954 {{ended the}} First Indochina War, it handed North Vietnam to Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh, {{and the south}} to the State of Vietnam. To reunify the country, {{national}} elections were scheduled for 1956, following which the French would withdraw from Indochina. The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> passive in rejecting the partition, and {{that half of the}} country should not have been yielded to the communists.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1943, it {{had become}} clear that the initial {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the town <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> low, and a second phase of construction was required. Plans now called for a town of 42,000 people. Work began in the fall of 1943, and continued into the late summer of 1944. Hospitals were expanded, as were the police and fire services, and the telephone system. Only 4,793 of a planned total of 6,000 family houses were built, mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along State Route 61. They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories, 2,089 trailers, 391 hutments, a cantonment area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks. Some 2,823 of the family units were prefabricated off-site. The high school was expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Two additional primary schools were built, and existing ones were expanded so that they could accommodate 7,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel {{in line with what}} players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.|$|E
5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition and placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command over his four ships. The small fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off {{the east coast of}} Yucatán. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures. The fleet then sailed south along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, but Grijalva did not land at any of these and turned back north to loop around the north of the peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest; the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.|$|E

5|$|During this stage, Antoine Fauré lead {{close to}} his hometown, and 200 fans {{tried to stop the}} rest of the cyclists from {{following}} him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of this help, Fauré was the first on top of the Col de la République, but was taken over by the favourites later. Aucouturier won the sprint. When the riders reached Marseille, they complained that there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> many incidents in this stage, and the stage results should be cancelled. In the last part, they had been stopped by a large group of cyclists. Maurice Garin had been attacked, and his arm had been injured: he finished the stage steering with only one hand. There was so much confusion at the last controle post, that the exact arrival times of the cyclists were not recorded.|$|E
5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Fray José Francisco Garza befriended {{some of the}} Karankawa {{and other}} native peoples. Their {{friendship}} allowed Garza to explore much of the coastal areas that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to visit. The Indians requested that Garza build a mission at the junction of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, and in February 1793 Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio opened near Mission Lake {{at the head of}} San Antonio Bay. Over 230Indians lived at the mission initially, but within two years they were forced to move to a less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, only a small number of the hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1952, IX Corps {{launched}} an offensive, Operation Showdown, intended {{to improve its}} defensive lines by capturing a complex of hills and force Chinese lines back. This complex included Pike's Peak, Jane Russell Hill, Sandy Hill, and Triangle Hill, northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division advanced, encountering resistance from the 15th Chinese Field Army. In the ensuing Battle of Triangle Hill, the four hills were captured and recaptured by both sides {{several times in the}} heaviest fighting that year. Eventually, the UN forces withdrew having been unsuccessful in capturing their objectives. UN forces suffered 9,000 killed and the Chinese suffered 19,000 killed or wounded during the fighting. The result of the battle had only been a slight improvement in IX Corps' positions, as Chinese positions <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> well fortified for the UN forces to take and hold the ground. For the remainder of the year, US and Chinese forces both conducted a series of smaller raids on each other's lines, avoiding major conflicts, as armistice negotiations continued unsuccessfully. In November, the Chinese {{launched an}}other offensive to retake ground lost during these operations, which was again repulsed by UN forces.|$|E
