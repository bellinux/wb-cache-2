25|$|The 466th began {{operations}} on 22 March 1944 {{by participating in}} a daylight raid on Berlin. The group operated primarily as a strategic bombardment organization, attacking such targets as marshalling yards at Liege, an airfield at St Trond, a repair and assembly plant at Reims, an airfield at Chartres, factories at Brunswick, oil refineries at Bohlen, aircraft plants at Kempten, mineral works at Hamburg, marshalling yards at Saarbrücken, a synthetic oil plant at Misburg, a <b>fuel</b> <b>depot</b> at Dulmen, and aero engine works at Eisenach.|$|E
40|$|The International Labour Organization and all {{organizations}} {{of human rights}} advocate against any form of negative attitude in employment based on gender, its terms, promotion and relations. Shop floor employees play {{a very important role}} in the daily advancement and profitability of an organisation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish the attitude of shop floor employees toward women managers in <b>fuel</b> <b>depots</b> in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The study adopted a descriptive survey design with the population consisting of one hundred and ninety three (193) shop floor employees. A semi structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. In total one hundred and twenty one (121) shop floor employees responded yielding a response rate of sixty three percent (63 %). The findings of this study indicate that a negative attitude toward woman managers is prevalent in the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Depots</b> of Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the <b>fuel</b> <b>depots,</b> the number of women working was less than a third of the males. In spite of this, women managers are rated higher in management qualities and are considered to be more honest, diligent, compassionate, creative and intelligent when compared to their male counterparts. The study recommends a culture change among employees in <b>fuel</b> <b>depots</b> in Lubumbashi in order to enable them perceive women as equal partners at the work place...|$|R
