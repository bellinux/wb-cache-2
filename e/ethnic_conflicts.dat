5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev's {{introduction}} of the policies of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s also fueled Armenian visions {{of a better life}} under Soviet rule. The Hamshenis who were deported by Stalin to Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to move them to the Armenian SSR. This move was denied by the Soviet government because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> with their Christian Armenian cousins. However, another event that occurred during this time made an ethnic clash between Christian Armenians and Muslims inevitable.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Tales games, it features an action-based battle system, called the Three-Line Linear Motion Battle System. The game {{was developed by}} the 2D Tales development unit Team Destiny. The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny. The scenario, written by Hiramatsu Masaki, dealt extensively with issues of coexistence between races and <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The game has received positive reviews and strong sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 2 version eventually selling over 600,000 units and the PSP re-release selling over 83,000. Western sites have been positive about the game, though neither version of the game have received English localizations.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts,</b> particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
25|$|Academic {{explanations}} of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> generally fall {{into one of}} three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist or constructivist. Recently, several political scientists have argued for either top-down or bottom-up explanations for <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict.</b> Intellectual debate has also focused on whether <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> has become more prevalent {{since the end of the}} Cold War, and on devising ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation.|$|R
50|$|Nationalism and <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Conflict</b> is a 1994 {{book in the}} Current Controversies series, {{presenting}} {{selections of}} contrasting viewpoints on five central questions about nationalism and ethnic conflict: whether nationalism is beneficial; whether ethnic violence is ever justified; what the causes of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> are; whether nations should intervene in ethnic conflicts; and how <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> can be prevented. It was edited by Charles P. Cozic.|$|R

5|$|Lenin {{expected}} Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie {{to oppose}} his government, but {{he believed that}} the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict. In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing Russian Civil War pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik Whites, but also encompassed <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the Green armies, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.|$|E

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War thus sparked {{interest}} in two important questions about ethnic conflict: whether ethnic conflict was on the rise and whether given that some <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> had escalated into serious violence, what, if anything, could scholars of large-scale violence (security studies, strategic studies, interstate politics) offer by way of explanation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which the dominant, Western-centric narrative of ethnopolitics limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying causes and features of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> in Indonesia. This is achieved through a comparative analysis of {{the way in which}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> is understood in the dominant narrative compared to the Indonesian context as it presents in Indonesian language and Indonesianist scholarship. In particular, alarmist images of an ‘arc of instability’, a ‘balkanised Indonesia’ and an ‘archipelago of fear’ conveyed through the dominant narrative as destined, natural or inevitable will be challenged. Analysis of Indonesian scholarship and commentary revealed two main themes divergent from the dominant narrative of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict.</b> Firstly, the consideration of political and economic factors as the underlying causes of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict,</b> and secondly, the dual comprehension of ethnicity as both primordial and instrumentalist. Themes of political and economic drivers of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> in Indonesia thus provided the theoretical structure for this thesis. Initially, this may appear to convey Indonesian understandings of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> as strictly instrumentalist, however deeper examination of Indonesian discourses surrounding concepts of Pancasila, SARA, religion, and communal identity, revealed strong primordialist notions that work to complement, rather than oppose instrumentalist theories. In so doing, this thesis reveals the way in which Indonesian understandings of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> illuminate alternate interpretations of ethnicity emphasising notions of political nostalgia, the nature of conflict in society, and ideas of conflict entrepreneurship. This thesis proposes the need for a new framework with which to analyse <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> and fully comprehend <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> in Indonesia outside of the rigid, traditional confines of international relations and ethnic studies frameworks...|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, ethnic-based political parties were constituted by both the Hungarians, who founded the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, and by the Romanian Transylvanians, who founded the Romanian National Unity Party. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>conflicts,</b> however, never occurred on a significant scale, even though some violent clashes, such as the Târgu Mureș events of March 1990, did take place shortly after the fall of Ceaușescu regime.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1990s, {{there were}} 180 regiments (of varying size) of Internal Troops, of which 90 were mainly guards of correctional institutions, {{important}} public facilities and public order.

25|$|The Illyrian descent theory {{soon became}} one of the pillars of Albanian nationalism, {{especially}} because it could provide some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence both in Kosovo and in southern Albania, i.e., areas that were subject to <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> between Albanians, Serbs and Greeks.

25|$|When {{they entered}} Italy, some Lombards {{retained}} their native form of paganism, while some were Arian Christians.

25|$|Meles' {{policy of}} ethnic {{federalism}} has {{been attacked by}} two groups of opposition parties. Pan-Ethiopian opposition parties like AEUP, UEDP-medhin and Andenet accused Meles of harming the stability and unity of Ethiopia by dividing the country on language lines. They expressed their fear for the future unity of the country, pointing out a rise in <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> after the ethnic federalism policy introduced, whereas in the past Ethiopia's economic marginalization of groups or ethnicities was a cause of warfare in the country, as experts indicated.|$|E
25|$|In July and August 2017, Taban Deng Gai's SPLM-IO faction {{announced}} that 7,000 rebel fighters in Wau State had defected from Machar's faction to the pro-government forces; this claim {{could not be}} independently verified and was denied by the opposition. Only about 150 rebels, led by lieutenant colonels Santino Akot Majok and Salva Ujok Achor, were confirmed to have surrendered. Fighting in the countryside continued, while <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> spread to northern Wau State, where tribal fighters from Gogrial State destroyed a village.

During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalent}} {{nationalism in}} political circles {{was fueled by}} the large size of Poland's minority populations and their separate agendas. According to the language criterion of the Polish census of 1931, the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the Yiddish language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant {{of the interests of}} its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic {{decrease in the number of}} Ukrainian language schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.|$|E

Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} mixed {{feelings}} over the European population's increased life expectancy and declining birth rate ever since the European countries {{were the first to}} start the demographic transition between the 18th and 19th century, and perhaps even more since this was achieved. Demographic studies and resultant reports conducted by the European Commission point to the declining birth rate {{of the population of the}} native European peoples, which would need to be reversed from its present level of about 1.4 in order to preclude a population decline of the native European peoples by nearly half in each generation, back to a replacement level of 2.1. Some have claimed that in order to compensate, it is necessary to allow migrants to settle in Europe in order to prevent labour shortages. It has been argued that such immigration leads to <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts,</b> such as the 2005 civil unrest in France.|$|E
25|$|Although a kabya himself, Ne Win banned Chinese-language {{education}} and created other measures {{to compel the}} Chinese to leave. Ne Win's government stoked up racial animosity and <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> against the Chinese, who were terrorized by Burmese citizens, the most violent riots taking place {{at the time of}} the Cultural Revolution in China in 1967. All schools were nationalized, including Chinese language schools. Beginning in 1967 and continuing throughout the 1970s, anti-Chinese riots continued to flare up and many believed they were covertly supported by the government. Similarly, Chinese shops were looted and set on fire. Public attention was successfully diverted by Ne Win from the uncontrollable inflation, scarcity of consumer items and rising prices of rice. The 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese (as it stratified citizenship into three categories: full, associate, and naturalized) and severely limited Burmese Chinese, especially those without full citizenship and those holding FRCs, from attending professional tertiary schools, including medical, engineering, agricultural and economics institutions. During this period, the country's failing economy and widespread discrimination accelerated an emigration of Burmese Chinese out of Burma.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the reign}} of King Seon (830), there is no {{surviving}} written records of Balhae. Some scholars believe that the 946 eruption of Paektu Mountain may have caused a national level catastrophe leading to its final fall to the Khitan Liao Dynasty, while other historians believe that <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> between the ruling Koreans and underclass Mohe weakened the state. The Khitans were centered in Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, which overlaps Balhae's purported territories in the west. A Khitan invasion took the capital of Balhae after a 25-day siege in 926. After defeating Balhae, the Khitans established a puppet state, the Dongdan Kingdom, which was annexed by Liao in 936. Some Balhae aristocrats were forced to move to Liaoyang, but Balhae's eastern territory remained politically independent. Goryeosa records the arrival {{of tens of thousands}} of Balhae households, led by a general escaping from the Khitans in 925, one year before the final collapse of the kingdom. The rest of the Balhae people were assimilated into the Khitan polity as well as the Jurchens who would revolt against the Khitans later in the century. Some descendants of the Balhae emigre in Goryeo changed their family name to Tae (태, 太) while Crown Prince Dae Gwang-hyeon was given the family name Wang (왕, 王), the royal family name of the Goryeo dynasty. Balhae was the last state in Korean history to hold any significant territory in Manchuria, although later Korean dynasties would continue to regard themselves as successors of Goguryeo and Balhae.|$|E

40|$|Political {{decentralization}} {{is widely}} believed to reduce <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> and secessionism in the world today. Yet decentralization is more successful in reducing conflict and secessionism in some countries than in others. In this article, I explore why this difference occurs. I demonstrate using a statistical analysis of thirty democracies from 1985 to 2000 that decentralization may decrease <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> and secessionism directly by bringing the government closer {{to the people and}} increasing opportunities to participate in government, but that decentralization increases <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> and secessionism indirectly by encouraging the growth of regional parties.
