5|$|Leonardo's notes {{appear to}} have been {{intended}} for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this. In many cases a single topic, for example, the heart or the human <b>fetus,</b> <b>is</b> covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet. Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A Syndicate surgeon {{attempting}} to procure the alien <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> killed {{by one of}} the alien rebels, who assumes his form. Krycek finds the dead surgeon and the fetus missing, and tells Spender that the rebels are now going to succeed in their goals to halt colonization. The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base. Shortly after Fowley arrives, a white light appears around one end of the hangar. It is revealed to be the rebels, who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate—except for The Smoking Man and Fowley—who escape by car.|$|E
5|$|By then, Lincoln {{has broken}} {{out of the}} cold locker and called for backup. Frank rushes Fauxlivia to a {{hospital}} while Lincoln interrogates Dr. Silva. Dr. Silva reveals he was the last host, and implores Lincoln to remember his name as he extracts the live queen beetle from his body and dies. Meanwhile, Frank discovers Fauxlivia is pregnant; the adrenaline had induced morning sickness symptoms. At the hospital, the <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> found to be six weeks old. Frank realizes he was away at that time, accuses Fauxlivia of sleeping with another man, and leaves her. Fauxlivia cries to herself, realizing her child's father is Peter (Joshua Jackson) from her time in the prime universe.|$|E

3000|$|... 94 <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> {{female and}} 60 <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> male. The {{measurements}} {{did not show}} any {{significant differences between the}} two genders (p =  0.12, 0.66, 0.79 and 0.60 for SCW, anterior CCW, lateral CCW and posterolateral CCW, respectively).|$|R
5000|$|The {{tally of}} <b>fetuses</b> <b>was</b> {{estimated}} at [...] "up to 17,000" [...] in May 1982, {{and was later}} finally set at 16,431. A count of 193 <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> evidently over 20 weeks' gestation, with the oldest almost 30 weeks.|$|R
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
500|$|Pulos and Hutt {{reported}} that neonatal death rates in white foals {{were similar to}} those in non-white foals, and concluded that homozygous white fetuses died during gestation.

50|$|The initial press conference, on February 5, 1982, by the Los Angeles County Health Department said up to 500 <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> found.

5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
25|$|Whether the <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> an {{affected}} girl can {{be determined}} by chorionic villus sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by amniocentesis at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex {{can be determined}} quickly, and if the <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> a male the dexamethasone can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed {{to see if she}} carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the CYP21 gene. If so, dexamethasone is continued {{for the remainder of the}} pregnancy at a dose of about 1mg daily.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fetuses</b> <b>are</b> {{exposed to}} {{prenatal}} androgens {{as early as}} 8 weeks into development. Male <b>fetuses</b> <b>are</b> exposed to much higher levels of androgens than female <b>fetuses.</b> It has <b>been</b> found that toy preferences, play-mates, and play-styles vary with the child’s exposure to androgens. Regardless of the biological sex of the child, increased androgen exposure is associated with more masculine-type behaviors, while decreased androgen exposure is associated with more feminine-type behaviors.|$|R

50|$|Macroscopic lesions {{have not}} been {{reported}} in pregnant dams; however, microscopic lesions have been seen in tissues of gilts killed after their <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> infected by transuterine inoculation of virus. Gilts that were seronegative when their <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> infected at 70 days of gestation had focal accumulations of mononuclear cells adjacent to the endometrium and in deeper layers of the lamina propria when they were killed 12 and 21 days later. In addition, there were perivascular cuffs of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the brain, spinal cord, and choroid of the eye. When <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> infected earlier in gestation (35, 50, and 60 days) and their dams were killed 7 and 11 days later, the lesions were similar. However, uterine lesions were more severe and also included extensive cuffing of myometrial and endometrial vessels with mononuclear cells. Only focal accumulations of lymphocytes were seen in uteruses of gilts that were seropositive when their <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> infected.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundRodent {{models of}} {{abdominal}} wall defects (AWD) may {{provide insight into}} the pathophysiology of these conditions including gut dysfunction in gastroschisis, or pulmonary hypoplasia in exomphalos. Previously, a Scribble mutant mouse model (circletail) was reported to exhibit gastroschisis. We further characterise this AWD in Scribble knockout mice. MethodHomozygous Scrib knockout mice were obtained from heterozygote matings. <b>Fetuses</b> <b>were</b> collected at E 17. 5 – 18. 5 with intact amniotic membranes. Three mutants and two control <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> imaged by in amnio micro-MRI. Remaining <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> dissected, photographed and gut length/weight measured. Ileal specimens were stained for interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), imaged using confocal microscopy and ICC quantified. Results 127 <b>fetuses</b> <b>were</b> collected, 15 (12 %) exhibited AWD. Microdissection revealed 3 mutants had characteristic exomphalos phenotype with membrane-covered gut/liver herniation into the umbilical cord. A further 12 exhibited extensive AWD, with eviscerated abdominal organs and thin covering membrane (intact or ruptured). Micro-MRI confirmed these phenotypes. Gut was shorter and heavier in AWD group compared to controls but morphology/number of ICC was not different. DiscussionThe Scribble knockout fetus exhibits exomphalos (intact and ruptured), in contrast to the original published phenotype of gastroschisis. Detailed dissection of <b>fetuses</b> <b>is</b> essential ensuring accurate phenotyping and result reporting...|$|R
25|$|Fetal lung {{maturity}} {{is associated}} with how much surfactant the <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> producing. Reduced production of surfactant indicates decreased lung maturity and is a high risk factor for infant respiratory distress syndrome. Typically a lecithin:sphingomyelin ratio greater than 1.5 {{is associated with}} increased lung maturity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> genetically {{different}} from the woman and {{can be viewed as}} an unusually successful allograft. The main reason for this success is increased immune tolerance during pregnancy. Immune tolerance is the concept that the body is able to not mount an immune system response against certain triggers.|$|E
25|$|Lack of the Y {{chromosome}} in {{the maternal}} plasma {{suggests that the}} <b>fetus</b> <b>is</b> female, but could also indicate failure to detect cffDNA in the maternal plasma. Thus, paternal polymorphisms or sex independent markers are further used to detect cffDNA. High heterozygosity of these markers must be detected {{for them to be}} applied.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{infection}} happens at 40 days, death and mummification may occur. Also in this case, {{some or all}} the <b>fetuses</b> <b>are</b> involved, i.e. some of the <b>fetuses</b> can <b>be</b> born healthy and immunotolerant, or else carriers of the disease.|$|R

25|$|Estimates {{for female}} {{foeticide}} vary by scholar. One group estimates more than 10 million female foetuses {{may have been}} illegally aborted in India since 1990s, and 500,000 girls were being lost annually due to female foeticide.

25|$|Abortion: Badnarik {{personally}} opposes abortion, but {{believes that}} decisions regarding abortion rights {{should be made}} {{at the state and}} not the federal level.
