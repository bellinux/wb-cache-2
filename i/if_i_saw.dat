Over the next {{three and a half years}} he spent $10,000,000 a month on Great Depression relief works. He worked with the local politicians and labor leaders. He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left-wing groups, once declaring that [...] "I wouldn't know a Red <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> one, and wouldn't do anything about it if I did". The biggest project was the construction of LaGuardia Airport. Somervell established a reputation as a man who could handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E

Each tree bore the name of some {{prominent}} citizen and if that citizen fell out of favour with her she ceased to water it. So that if the leaves of 'Mr Archer' were drooping and the leaves of 'Mr Marsh' were bright and green or 'Mr Barclay' was growing vigorously one knew at once what had happened in the handling of her latest request. I visited her on several occasions and could never restrain a curious glance at my tree and felt suitably gratified <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that 'Mr Hasluck' was being watered regularly.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Conservative Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper called Wong's {{argument}} [...] "prejudiced", [...] "absurd", [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "without foundation". He {{sent the}} Globe a similar letter. [...] "These actions (the killings) deserve our unqualified moral condemnation, not {{an excuse for}} printing prejudices masked {{in the language of}} social theory," [...] Harper wrote. Parti Québécois leader André Boisclair declared that the journalist had, on the intellectual level, [...] "slipped into the dregs" [...] ("glissé dans les bas fonds"). Former Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry declared to La Tribune [...] "if she is of good faith, she will have to apologize [...] It is incredible that it is still possible today to convey such delirious opinions on Quebec. Especially in an era when Quebec is more cosmopolitan than ever. [...] It is insulting for Quebec and dishonouring for Canada. In the same way as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a similar article about Ontario in La Tribune, I would be ashamed for La Tribune." ...|$|E

He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, ' you. And [...] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health, you are getting out of here handicapped. And he said to me, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.'
