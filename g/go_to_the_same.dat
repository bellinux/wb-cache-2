25|$|Rendezvous {{in orbit}} {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed {{to catch up with}} another, the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first, and then later to increase speed and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> orbit as the other. To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of China's imports consists of industrial supplies and capital goods, notably machinery and high-technology equipment, the majority of which comes from the developed countries, primarily Japan and the United States. Regionally, almost half of China's imports come from East and Southeast Asia, and about one-fourth of China's exports <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> destinations. About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, {{most of which are}} textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest ports in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $232.5billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%. China's share of total U.S. imports has grown from 7% to 15% since 1996.|$|E

He released two more EPs—Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview on July 31 and Air Preview on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for The Village Voice, Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it [...] "a great {{way for me to}} reconnect with my peers ... the people that I hang out with—that <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the first}} {{selection}} in the draft, the Buccaneers picked Lee Roy Selmon, {{considered to be}} the best defensive tackle in Oklahoma history and described as “one of the greatest defensive linemen I have ever watched” by coach McKay. Shortly thereafter, with their second pick of the second round, they took his brother Dewey. The two, who were the two leading tacklers on the 1975 Oklahoma Sooners football team, were the third pair of brothers in NFL history to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> team in the same draft. They became the only pair of brothers to play for the same NFL team at the same time until Lyle Blackwood joined his brother Glenn on the Miami Dolphins’ roster in 1981. The move prompted brother Lucious Selmon to offer to come out of retirement if Tampa Bay would obtain his NFL rights. The Buccaneers spent their first second-round pick on Florida fullback Jimmy DuBose, and took Colorado offensive tackle Steve Young in the third round. Later-round picks who made the team included defensive back Curtis Jordan, quarterback Parnell Dickinson, and running back George Ragsdale. Carl Roaches, later a Pro Bowl return man for the Houston Oilers, and Tommy West, later the head coach at Clemson and the University of Memphis, [...] were selected by the Buccaneers but did not make the roster.|$|E

2500|$|A {{revolution}} {{in public opinion}} occurred during the late 1950s and early 1960s on issues of civil rights.

In 1956, {{the year before the}} 1957 Act, less than half of white Americans agreed with the statement, [...] "White students and Negro students should <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> schools." [...] By 1963, the year before the 1964 Act, that figure had jumped to 62%. In 1956, a healthy majority of white Americans—60%—opposed [...] "separate sections for Negroes on streetcars and buses." [...] By 1963, the number had grown to 79% opposed—an overwhelming majority. Even in the South, minds were being changed.

2500|$|Spinors can be {{exhibited}} as concrete objects using {{a choice}} of Cartesian coordinates. [...] In three Euclidean dimensions, for instance, spinors can be constructed by making {{a choice of}} Pauli spin matrices corresponding to (angular momenta about) the three coordinate axes. These are 2×2 matrices with complex entries, and the two-component complex column vectors on which these matrices act by matrix multiplication are the spinors. [...] In this case, the spin group is isomorphic {{to the group of}} 2×2 unitary matrices with determinant one, which naturally sits inside the matrix algebra. [...] This group acts by conjugation on the real vector space spanned by the Pauli matrices themselves, realizing it as a group of rotations among them, corresponding to the two different elements of the spin group that <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rotation. but it also acts on the column vectors (that is, the spinors).|$|E

2500|$|Those who {{criticize the}} analogy argue that Israeli {{policies}} {{have little or}} no comparison to apartheid South Africa, and that the motivation and historical context of Israel's policies are different. It is argued that Israel itself is a democratic and pluralist state, while the West Bank and Gaza are not part of sovereign Israel and cannot be compared to the internal policies of apartheid South Africa. According to Gerald Steinberg, the attempt to label Israel an apartheid state is [...] "the embodiment of the new antisemitism that seeks to deny the Jewish people the right of equality and self-determination." [...] Others say that it is [...] "a foolish and unfair comparison", that Arab citizens of Israel have the same rights as other Israeli citizens and that [...] "full social and political equality of all [...] citizens, without distinction of race, creed or sex" [...] is specifically guaranteed by Israeli law. Arab-Israeli journalist Khaled Abu Toameh says, [...] "Fortunately, Arab citizens can <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> beaches, restaurants and shopping malls as Jews in this 'apartheid' state. Moreover, they can run in any election and even have a minister in the government (Ghaleb Majadlah) for the first time". Others state that the comparison to apartheid is defamatory and inflammatory, and reflects a double standard when applied to Israel since it does not comment on the human and civil rights in neighboring Arab countries or within the Palestinian territories.|$|E
2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital. Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We tried morphing to a live action Hoff – {{but it did not}} hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version,..and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double,- we didn't want to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body… so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt." [...] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment.
