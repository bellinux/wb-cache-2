25|$|Yoshimi is {{a second}} year student from class 2-C, Leo's classmate {{and a member of}} the student council. She is popular with everyone, she is an honour student, is quick in her movements, is a good cook, and is sweet-tempered. She puts the brakes on Erika Kiriya once in a while, for Erika tends to go her own way without {{consulting}} anyone. She at first appears to be a very mature person, however, her true nature <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> opposite. Erika is her close friend who understands her true self. She often approaches Leo, who does not notice Yoshimi's deep feelings for him.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Ron and Tammys" [...] Tammy 1 assumes {{control of}} Ron, turning {{him into a}} mustache-less pushover {{in an effort to}} remarry him and take all his hidden gold. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} compared to the influence Ron's latest ex (Tammy 2) has over him. [...] While Tammy 1 has an ice cold personality and reduces Ron into submissiveness and quietude, Tammy 2 causes Ron to make highly irrational decisions that end up jeopardizing his position at the Parks office. [...] Tammy 2 also tries to assume control of Ron through using manipulation of her body. [...] Ron is saved from the grasp of Tammy 1 after his own mother, who is also ironically a Tammy- her name is Tamara (he refers to her as Tammy 0) to restore her son. [...] He snaps back to his old self after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. [...] They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first one out of the contest. In the end, Ron finally comes to his senses and stands up for himself and tells both Tammys to leave.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the years}} as CIGS, Brooke had a stormy {{relationship}} with Winston Churchill. Brooke was often frustrated with the Prime Minister's habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters. At the same time Brooke greatly admired Churchill {{for the way he}} inspired the Allied cause and for the way he bore the heavy burden of war leadership. In one typical passage in Brooke's war diaries Churchill is described as a [...] "genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision – he <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck but I should not have missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!" ...|$|E

[...] To start with, no one has yet thought to accuse Israel of creating a phony country in finally acquiescing {{to the creation of a}} Palestinian state. Palestine is no Bantustan. Furthermore, Israel has always had Arab citizens. No doubt many Israelis have racist attitudes toward Arabs, but the official philosophy of the government <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> opposite, and sincere efforts are made to, for example, instill humanitarian and egalitarian attitudes in children.|$|E
2500|$|According to Alderson, Lauren is very {{different}} from Starr, though the two still had some similarities. Alderson had been posting several pictures via social media but intentionally hiding her hair, leading to speculation that her appearance would be {{very different}}. A SOAPnet promo confirmed Alderson's change in appearance in early May. Alderson revealed to Soap Opera Digest that Kiki is reminiscent of a younger Starr who <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> trouble maker. Alderson said she [...] "channeled the sassy, spunky bad girl that Starr used to be before she matured." [...] She continued, [...] "Kiki's also a little more seductive." [...] Alderson described Kiki as being [...] "darker and edgier" [...] then her former alter ego. Kiki is [...] "risqué" [...] when compared to Starr who is a [...] "one man kind of girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} of the heavy warmbloods was the Oldenburg. Today's Oldenburg is bred for sport, and so the old type is {{designated}} as such: Alt-Oldenburger. The history of the Oldenburg is almost indistinguishable from that of horses bred in nearby East Frisia. Though there are two names (Old-Oldenburg and East Friesian), the horse <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> same, having always exchanged genetic material. The plow horses of the Frisian marshes had to be powerful {{to work through the}} heavy soil, and so were significantly heavier than farm horses in other parts of Europe. Organized horse breeding began in Oldenburg under Count Anton Günther (1603–1667), who brought popular stallions from Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Poland. Later on, Cleveland Bays were introduced as well, and the result was a solid, good-natured mare base from which came the Karossier.|$|E

2500|$|During the Restoration {{the print}} {{revolution}} {{began to change}} every aspect of British society. It became possible for anyone to spend {{a small amount of}} money and have his or her opinions published as a broadsheet, and {{to gain access to the}} latest discoveries in science, literature, and political theory, as books became less expensive and digests and [...] "indexes" [...] of the sciences grew more numerous. The difficulty lay in discerning truth from falsehood, credible claims from impossible one. Swift writes A Tale of a Tub in the guise of a narrator who is excited and gullible about what the new world has to offer, and feels that he <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> equal or superior of any author who ever lived because he, unlike them, possesses 'technology' and newer opinions. Swift seemingly asks the question of what a person with no discernment but with a thirst for knowledge would be like, and the answer is the narrator of Tale of a Tub.|$|E
2500|$|From {{an article}} in The New York Times: [...] "He [...] has been to more Army camps and played to more {{soldiers}} than any other entertainer. He has crossed the Atlantic by plane to take song and cheer to the troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and the steaming forests of Trinidad. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp {{in this country has}} heard him sing and tell funny stories." [...] Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for Variety, in 1942: [...] "In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show." [...] After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, [...] "Allow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person. We unanimously elect you Public Morale Lifter No. 1 of the U.S Army." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> wrong way to describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, {{and then at the}} Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E

2500|$|Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger stated at {{the time}} that the {{strength}} of the Qing has been thoroughly demonstrated and that her prestige remained unsullied. [...] "Whatever danger there may be to the permanence of Qing's triumph lies rather from Russia than from the peoples of Tian Shan Nan Lu; nor is there much danger that the Chinese laurels will become faded even before a European foe. Zuo Zongtang and his generals such as Jin Shun and Chang Yao, accomplished a task which would reflect credit on any army and any country. They have given a luster to the modern Chinese administration which must stand it in good stead, and they have acquired a personal renown that will not easily depart. The Qing reconquest of Xinjiang is beyond doubt the most remarkable event that has occurred in Asia during the last fifty years, and it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>the</b> most brilliant achievement of a Chinese army, led by Chinese generals, that has taken place since the Qianlong Emperor subdued the country more than a century ago. It also proves, in a manner that is more than unpalatable to us, that the Chinese possess an adaptive faculty that must be held to be a very important fact in every-day politics in Central Asia. They reconquered Kashgaria with European weapons and by careful study of Western science and technology. Their soldiers marched in obedience to instructors trained on the Prussian principle; and their generals maneuvered their troops in accordance with the teachings of Moltke and Manteuffel. Even in such minor matters as the use of telescopes and field glasses we could find this Chinese army well supplied. Nothing was more absurd than the picture drawn by some over-wise observer of this army, as consisting of soldiers fantastically garbed in the guise of dragons and other hideous appearances. All that belonged to an old-world theory. The rebel troops were as widely different from all previous Chinese armies in Central Asia as it well could be; and in all essentials closely resembled that of a European power. Its remarkable triumphs were chiefly attributable to the thoroughness with which China had in this instance adapted herself to Western notions". [...] "But, although our hands are tied in Central Asia, they are not fettered at Pekin, and we certainly should congratulate, if we have not done so already, the Chinese on their remarkable successes in the Tian Shan regions. That step might be pregnant with beneficent results, and our desire to be on good terms with our new, yet our old, neighbour might be met in a cordial manner by the Chinese." ...|$|E
