40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the optimum content of a 1 -day classroom-based crew resource management (<b>CRM)</b> <b>course</b> for health-care personnel working in ad hoc teams in complex, time-critical hospital departments such as surgery, intensive care or emergency. Design: A two-round modified Delphi panel. Participants selected teamwork competency components suitable for inclusion in 1 day of training from a list developed via literature review. Participants: Fifteen experts in health care, CRM and training. Main Outcome Measure: Knowledge, skill and attitude competency components for a 1 -day <b>CRM</b> <b>course.</b> Results: Of the 110 knowledge, skill and attitude CRM competency components, 40 components were selected by greater than 70 % of respondents, whereas the remaining 62 components were selected by fewer than 55 % of respondents. These 40 competency components ranged across five competency domains: communication, task management, situational awareness, decision-making and leadership, and provided a consensus on the most critical areas for inclusion in training for health-care personnel. Conclusions: This new competency model is now available for use. Although the sample size was limited, a high degree of consensus was reached after only two rounds. A modified Delphi technique within the context of competencies first refined from the literature was a useful and cost-effective method for determining the content of a 1 -day <b>CRM</b> training <b>course</b> for health-care workers. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} the development, evaluation and outcomes of a pilot crisis resource management (<b>CRM)</b> <b>course</b> developed {{specifically for the}} Ambulatory Surgery sector. Methods: The scenario-based course (DaCRM) covered the diagnosis and management {{of a number of}} potential medical emergencies. Evaluation incorporated pre- and post course surveys and follow-up interviews. Results: All participants applied learnings either clinically or organizationally in their workplace, and one successfully diagnosed and managed a malignant hyperthermia event. Conclusion: Some important generalizable principles were demonstrated: team-based CRM training of clinical and non-clinical staff can increase confidence, ameliorate possible de-skilling in Ambulatory Surgery settings and can save lives...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a model which is used as a framework for the training of judgement and decision making in <b>CRM</b> <b>courses</b> for airline pilots. The acronym FOR-DEC stands for six different phases of the decision making process: Facts, Options, Risks & Benefits, Decision, Execution, and Check. The advantages of such a simple prescriptive model are that it can easily be remembered and that it helps to structure judgemental and decision making processes in the cockpit. It therefore counteracts certain cognitive mechanisms that can adversely affect the quality of aeronautical decisions in terms of flight safety...|$|R
40|$|Medical errors {{result in}} 44, 000 to 98, 000 deaths {{per year in}} the United States of America. Within the {{surgical}} specialties, half of these errors occur in the operating room. The origin of these errors is multifactorial, and is generally associated with problems in communication and teamwork. In order to improve safety in the operating room, many hospitals now propose to the medical staff "crew resource management" (CRM) training programs inspired by the aviation industry. This approach favors a better utilization of surgical checklists, improves efficiency during chirurgical interventions, and reduces patient mortality. In October 2009 we introduced a <b>CRM</b> <b>course</b> within the department of surgery at the Geneva University Hospitals. We are presenting this program as well as the first results following its application...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a lack of}} {{consensus}} {{on the nature of}} Computing Research Methods (CRM), a growing number of programs are exploring models and content for <b>CRM</b> <b>courses.</b> This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM. We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students...|$|R
40|$|High-risk {{industries}} are operating {{in an increasingly}} complex and dynamic environment; this leads to new perspectives {{on the role of}} the human operator in the safety management system, encouraging organizations to exploit the uniquely human capabilities of operator teams in order to maintain safe operations. Crew resource management is a popular framework for training operator teams, but has not yet been adapted to accommodate this theoretical development in any major way. Through an action research project within N-USOC, a control room supporting science missions at the International Space Station, a prototypical <b>CRM</b> <b>course</b> is developed for a distributed team working in a complex-dynamic environment, guided by theoretical analysis of safety literature and by the specific needs of the N-USOC context. Adaptive decision making strategies and skills are identified as important success factors for the human operator, along with developing team processes to increase the team capacity for managing safety margins. For N-USOC operators, building this desired adaptive expertise while learning how to manage workload and utilize domain expertise in time-critical situations is especially important. While the development of CRM training for N-USOC is not complete, the study represents a foundation to build upon for the organization, and a theoretical contribution to safety research. </p...|$|R

The purpose of these notes is to prove, in a {{reasonably}} self-contained way, that finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group implies the parity conjecture for elliptic curves over number fields. Along the way, we review local and global root numbers of elliptic curves and their classification, and discuss some peculiar consequences of the parity conjecture.

The aim {{of the project was}} to design, deliver, and evaluate an offshore <b>CRM</b> training <b>course.</b> A total of 77 offshore workers from three different North Sea production platforms attended the courses. Their feedback was generally positive indicating that CRM training can be adapted for this industrial sector. There was some evidence of a change in attitudes towards decision making and personal limitations. However, {{there is a need to}} develop sensitive evaluation measures to be able to draw more conclusive evidence of the effects of CRM training on safety performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with personnel in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) who had participated in an Aviation Team Training (ATT) program based on the principles of Crew Resource Management (<b>CRM).</b> The <b>courses</b> were conducted over a 12 month period and were subsequently evaluated using a questionnaire incorporating measures of post-training implementation activities, the transfer climate, and in-training transfer enhancing activi­ties. Open-ended questions asked about the impact of using the teamwork skills on the performance of crew members. The measure of transfer enhancing activities was signifi­cantly related to transfer implementation, while positive reinforcement in the workplace {{was a significant predictor of}} transfer implementation. Several positive outcomes of the ATT program were reported. The need for a model of verti­cal transfer that links individual transfer outcomes and the primary organisational outcome of enhancing aviation safety is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite reduced {{attendance}} {{numbers from}} previous years, this years AACRAO conference offered a solid program of sessions covering {{a variety of}} issues related to the work of Registrars and Admissions Officers. It also provided many networking opportunities to meet with colleagues and various vendors/service providers. I attended sessions related {{to a wide variety of}} topics, and found some that dealt with change management, measuring policy training effectiveness, as well as sessions focusing on improving the transmission and security of academic data particularly useful and thought provoking. Other useful sessions that I attended related to improving mass communications and using story to communicate effectively throughout the student lifecycle. The closing plenary, with Frontline’s Martin Smith, was timely as the discussion went beyond what his recent documentary featuring for profit education providers such as the Apollo Group/U Phoenix contained, and also included a preview of an upcoming episode that will focus on how these education providers are capturing a disproportionate amount of GI educational funding, and the impact this is having. I was also able to meet with our SunGard Account Executive and other SunGard staff for two lunch ‘n learn sessions that highlighted their <b>CRM</b> and <b>course</b> signals systems, at the request of our VP Information Technology and CIO. My experiences at AACRAO provided me with a number of ideas that may be of use to AU, all of which I will be sharing in the appropriate forums, although the feasibility of some need further investigation.

40|$|Cloud-system resolving models (CRM), {{which are}} based on the nonhydrostatic {{equations}} of motion and typically have a grid-spacing of about a kilometer, originated as cloud-process models in the 1970 s. This paper reviews the status and prospects of CRMs across a wide range of issues, such as microphysics and precipitation; interaction between clouds and radiation; and the effects of boundary-layer and surface-processes on cloud systems. Since CRMs resolve organized convection, tropical waves and the large-scale circulation, there is the prospect for several advances in both basic knowledge of scale-interaction requisite to parameterizing mesoscale processes in climate models. In superparameterization, CRMs represent convection, explicitly replacing many of the assumptions necessary in contemporary parameterization. Global CRMs have been run on an experimental basis, giving prospect to a new generation of climate weather prediction in a decade, and climate models due <b>course.</b> <b>CRMs</b> {{play a major role in}} the retrieval of surface-rain and latent heating from satellite measurements.
