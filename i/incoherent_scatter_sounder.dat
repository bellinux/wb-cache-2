50|$|The most {{well known}} {{practical}} application {{is known as}} <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar theory, a ground-based technique for studying the Earth's ionosphere first proposed by Professor Bill Gordon in 1958. A radar beam scattering off electrons in the ionospheric plasma creates an <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> return. The distribution function of the ionospheric electrons is modified by the much slower and more massive positive ions — electron density fluctuations relate to ion temperature, mass distribution, and motion. The <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> signal allows measurement of electron density, ion temperature and electron temperatures, ion composition and plasma velocity.|$|R
40|$|Small thermally-induced ﬂuctuation in the ionospheric {{electron}} density present a scattering cross-section, if probed with a radar frequency {{higher than the}} plasma frequency. This technique, known as the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scattering</b> from the ionosphere, is a well-established ﬁeld of study now. Since the conception of this ﬁeld of study in 1958, numerous theoretical and experimental efforts have {{led the way to}} the high precision ionospheric research we have today. The theory of the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> is highly robust. Recent advances in the radar hardware and computing technology have made it possible to probe the ionosphere using the full extent of this theory. In the effort presented here, high spectral resolution <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> experiments have been used to, for the ﬁrst time, fully understand the theoretical predictions concerning the electron component of <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter.</b> The two resonance lines that constitute the electron component are called the gyro line and the plasma line, and are greatly affected by the presence of the earth’s geomagnetic ﬁeld. The experiments described here present the ﬁrst unambiguous measurements of the gyro line with high spectral resolution in the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> spectrum. Plasma line experiments presented here show the existence of frequency gaps that were predicted {{in the early days of}} <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> theory, but never observed. High latitude plasma line measurements are presented here to show that using the plasma line technique, the gravity waves in the thermosphere can be detected. The intention here is to observe all the components of the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> and apply them to understand ionospheric processes...|$|R

These values yielded the exospheric temperature and the vertical distribution of neutral gas temperature. The satellite measured electron and ion temperatures and densities, neutral gas composition, and photoelectron spectra.

The results are compared to those of a time-dependent coupled model of the ionospheric E- and F-regions.

The three techniques provide similar patterns for the annual variations of the atomic oxygen concentration at 400 km, and the mean annual temperatures are within 20 K of each other for {{five of the six}} models involved. Four of the models are in good agreement concerning the annual temperature variation. There is fair agreement between <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> models and {{mass spectrometer}} models for the N 2 concentrations at 400 km but disagreement between these models and the satellite drag model.

Measurements of ionospheric and atmospheric properties were made simultaneously by the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar and the AE-C satellite instruments. The <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measured vertical profiles of the electron and ion temperatures and electron density and these data were used to derive a neutral gas temperature profile. The AE-C satellite measured the electron and ion densities and electron and ion temperatures, neutral gas composition, solar EUV flux, photoelectron spectra, the 6300 A volume emission rate profile {{and the distribution of}} NO along the satellite path. These simultaneous measurements provide a consistent set of data to examine current F-region theory in the daytime ionosphere. We used a time-dependent coupled model of the ionospheric E- and F-region to calculate the ionospheric properties over Millstone Hill at the times of the AE-C crossings and then compared the calculated structure to the observed structure. The results show good agreement between the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measurements and the model calculations. There is also good agreement among satellite and <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measurements and model calculations for the altitude of the satellite crossing, 161 km.

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} presents new <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar {{measurement techniques}} and data analysis methods. The measurements {{used in the}} study were collected by connecting a computer-based receiver to the EISCAT (European <b>Incoherent</b> <b>SCATter)</b> radar on Svalbard. This hardware consists of a spectrum analyzer, a PCI-bus-based programmable digital I/O card and a desktop computer with a large-capacity hard disk. It takes in the 70 -MHz signal from the ESR (Eiscat Svalbard Radar) signal path and carries out downconversion, AD conversion, quadrature detection, and nally stores the output samples ective sampling rate is 1 MHz, large enough to span all the frequency channels used in the experiment. Hence the total multichannel signal was stored instead of separate lagged products for each frequency channel, which is the procedure in the standard hardware. This solution has some benets including elimination of ground clutter with only a small loss in statistical accuracy. The capability of our hardware in storing the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar signals directly allows us to use very exible and versatile signal processing methods, which include clutter suppression, ltering, decoding, lag prole calculation, inversion and optimal height integration. The performance of these <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measurement techniques and data analysis methods are demonstrated by employing an <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> experiment that applies a new binary phase code. Each bit of this code has been further coded by a 5 -bit Barker code. In the analysis, stochastic inversion has been used for the rst time in decoding Barker-coded <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> measurements, and this method takes care of the ambiguity problems associated with the measurements. Finally, we present new binary phase codes with corresponding sidelobe-free decoding lters that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{and at the same time}} eliminate unwanted sidelobes completely...|$|R

40|$|Abstract From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of modern ionospheric science, different radar applications have been utilised in ionospheric measurements. The most sophisticated ionospheric radars are the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars, which detect the extremely weak scattering of radio waves from thermal fluctuations in the ionospheric plasma. Besides the low signal level, the stochastic nature of the scattering process causes further complications to the measurements. The scattering produces a zero-mean random signal, whose autocorrelation function contains the information of the ionospheric plasma parameters. <b>Incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars have been used for about half a century, but the demanding task of developing transmission modulation and data analysis is still in progress. In this thesis, a statistical inversion based method for removing range ambiguities from the autocorrelation functions, lag profile inversion, is applied to <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar data. The data have been recorded with the EISCAT <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars, located in Northern Fennoscandia. The method is first applied to standard EISCAT experiments, the results giving strong evidence that the method is applicable for the purpose, and it provides results of at least equal quality with the present standard methods. In subsequent studies, new radar modulation methods are developed, which may provide significant improvements to the present <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar experiments. All the methods have been tested with a real radar, and lag profile inversion has been successfully applied to the recorded data. The methods are also put to use in order to measure the predicted effects of artificial heating of the free electrons in the D-region of the ionosphere...|$|R
50|$|A further {{complication}} in {{the case}} of neutron scattering from hydrogenous materials is the strong <b>incoherent</b> <b>scattering</b> of hydrogen (80.27(6) barn). This leads to a very high background in neutron diffraction experiments, and may make structural investigations impossible. A common solution is deuteration, i.e., replacing the 1-H atoms in the sample with deuterium (2-H). The <b>incoherent</b> <b>scattering</b> length of deuterium is much smaller (2.05(3) barn) making structural investigations significantly easier. However, in some systems, replacing hydrogen with deuterium may alter the structural and dynamic properties of interest.|$|R
