25|$|The canal is {{now part}} of an active {{restoration}} project. As a result of a feasibility study, carried out between 2004 and 2006 by the consulting engineers Arup at the request of British Waterways, the proposed new route for the Churchbridge bypass would have run through new locks to a new junction at Grove Basin on the Cannock Extension Canal. However, this route proved to be unacceptable for a number of reasons, including the fact that the Cannock Extension Canal is a designated Special Area of Conservation, because it is colonised by a rare variety of <b>floating</b> <b>water</b> <b>plantain.</b> A second feasibility study, completed by Atkins in 2009, has now identified a route which would join the Wyrley and Essington Canal via the former Lord Hayes Branch instead. This route would help satisfy environmental concerns, be preferable to local landowners, and reduce the number of new road bridges needed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>water</b> <b>plantain</b> (Luronium natans [L. ] Rafinesque) is an {{aquatic plant}} endemic to Europe. It has a complex life history and ecology and is {{notoriously}} difficult to identify. Consequently, {{it has been}} the subject of past misconceptions, notably regarding its distribution, ecological requirements and population dynamics. This report presents a review of all data available to the authors and clarifies many aspects of the plantâ€™s distribution, ecology and life history. Each topic is supported by informed discussion of data to support the conclusions reached, because some of these are in direct disagreement with accepted views. The single most important conclusion is that Luronium natans has a number of apparently discrete reproductive strategies, defined here as: annual flowering; perennial flowering; and perennial vegetative. The second most important conclusion is that it occurs as dynamic metapopulations that contain different populations with different reproductive strategies. Any monitoring or conservation programme that does not take account of the dynamics of metapopulations and the requirements of the different reproductive strategies will not adequately represent the requirements of the species. Monitoring will provide a means by which data can be fed back into the system to refine conservation action. Further research is needed t...|$|E

40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>water</b> wheel could {{harvest energy}} from shallow flowing river to {{increase}} the potential of hydropower. Various types of water wheels have been studied by other researchers. However, {{the details of the}} design such as ridge/blade profile, number of ridges and submerged depth of <b>floating</b> <b>water</b> wheel have not been clearly established. In this research, experiments were carried out in an aquarium to study the optimum number of ridges, submerged depth and four different ridge profiles for a laboratory-scale <b>floating</b> <b>water</b> wheel. The results showed different ridge profiles and pitches and submerged depths contribute significant effects to the rotation of <b>floating</b> <b>water</b> wheel. The result of the experiment was used as reference for prototype design and fabrication. The prototype was tested in a river and successfully produced voltage from the flowing river. The experiment shows that the optimum number of ridges is 13, the best profile is thin flat ridge and maintaining the <b>floating</b> <b>water</b> wheel at certain submerged depth is important to its performance. The prototype concept is suitable for low head flow and varying water level. It is also portable, easily assembled and maintained and able to convert the kinetic energy of the water current into electrical energy...|$|R
