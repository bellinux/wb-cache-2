40|$|One of the {{aesthetic}} delights available to logologists is contemplating isograms: words, names, and other verbal entitites in which each of the alphabetic letters used appears the same specified number of times.

In a cryptographic context, solo <b>isograms</b> are known as nonpattern terms; in a pangrammatic setting, as partial pangrams.

3000|$|Given {{the course}} {{between the two}} end-points of the {{measured}} sequence for positioning (named EE-course), IESIL theoretically is to approximate the ideal operation of equidistance-segmenting the EE-course. This is realized by the <b>isograms</b> corresponding to the real-time samplings, which are collected with equal-time intervals. Therewith, the basic scheme is as follows. Firstly, in the [...] "hunting window" [...] estimated with INS's parameters, the measurements-corresponded <b>isograms</b> are extracted; secondly, searching the intersection line with Minimum Standard Deviation (MSD) about the lengths of its line segments, which are divided out by the <b>isograms.</b> And then the accurate location and attitude information can be obtained inversely.

An important future direction for research would be to examine how students learn to understand different kinds of <b>isograms,</b> and how experience with the diagrams in the form of speech and gestures influences learning. Beyond topographic maps specifically, and <b>isograms</b> more generally, conceptually focused speech and highlighting gestures might be useful to teach disciplinary diagrams across the STEM disciplines. As contour lines are employed to represent a wide range of content, such as three-dimensional mathematical functions and chemical state-change boundaries, it is critical to understand how these educational tools can be applied to potentially increase the effectiveness and efficiency of diagram education.|$|E

40|$|What is logology, {{otherwise}} known as recreational linguistics? There appear to be two ways to define it: subjectively, as an intellectual quest that stimulates and beguiles its devotees, and objectively, as a body of organized knowledge. The advent of the computer has sharpened this debate. Consider this example: in the old days, a fourteen-letter pair <b>isogram</b> (each letter appears exactly twice in the word) such as TAENIODONTIDAE could be found only by lengthy dictionary-searching, and its publication in Word Ways in August 1971 was a celebration of human persistence. However, {{since the publication of}} Levine 2 ̆ 7 s computer-generated pattern word lists, one can look this word up in a minute or so.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{constraints}} on component chemical potentials in three-phase fields {{introduced by the}} various <b>isograms</b> suggested in the literature are derived for a ternary system containing compounds. When compositions of two compounds lie on an isogram, it is associated with specific characteristics {{which can be used}} to obtain further understanding of the interplay of thermodynamic factors that determine phase equilibria. When two compounds are shared by adjacent three-phase fields, the constraints are dictated by binary compositions generated by the intersection of a line passing through the shared compounds with the sides of the ternary triangle. Generalized expressions for an arbitrary line through the triangle are presented. These are consistent with special relations obtained along Kohler, Colinet and Jacob <b>isograms.</b> Five axioms are introduced and proved. They provide valuable tools for checking consistency of thermodynamic measurements and for deriving thermodynamic properties from phase diagrams. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S. A...|$|E

30|$|Topographic {{maps are}} members of the class of {{diagrams}} called <b>isograms</b> (Brooks, 1916). Another example is a weather map where the continuous dimension of temperature is categorically displayed as regions where the temperature falls within specific values, and contour lines are drawn at the boundaries of those regions so that a contour connects points that have equivalent temperature values (Talman, 1910). In this case, the form of the iso-temperature contours preserves aspects of the spatial structure of the temperature distribution over the region, just as elevation contours preserve aspects of the spatial structure of the terrain. Yet another example is weather maps showing high and low pressure systems with contours to categorically indicate specific barometric pressure values. In general, all types of <b>isograms,</b> which encode one dimension categorically by segmenting continuous values arbitrarily, and visually preserve and continuously present other properties, are complex and can be difficult to learn and use (Hegarty, Canham, & Fabrikant, 2010; Taylor, Renshaw, & Choi, 2004).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture in silvopastoral system in the Loess Plateau of west Shanxi Province. Soil moisture in 0 - 100 cm layer was measured and analyzed in locustnatural grass system. The results showed as following: (1) There were significant differences of soil moisture in 0 - 100 cm layer in different phenological phases. Soil moisture contents in different patch types were different in silvopastoral system. The soil moisture contents of the grassland were significantly greater than the forestland's. (2) There were obvious hierarchy characteristics in soil profile in locust-natural grass system. The soil moisture contents and coefficient of variation both decreased with increase of soil depth. In horizontal direction, variations of soil moisture were relatively obvious in grassland, and soil moisture increased with the increase of the distance from forest edge to grassland. In forestland, variations of soil moisture were relatively complicated and soil moisture decreased with the increase of distance.

Furthermore, spatial distribution rules of sandlayer in Heidimiao oillayer {{are expected to be}} analyzed in this article through the data of stratum thickness, sandstone thickness, the thickness ratio of sandstone to stratum, and porosity <b>isogram.</b> The rules are described as: the Heidimiao oil layer is thick in east and north but thin in the west and south as a whole. Little sandstone is found in H 3 (Nen 2) but that is highly developed in H 2 (Nen 3) and H 1 (Nen 4) in which lenticular sandlayer can also be found. Sandstones in each oil group are developed with varying thickness, great depth difference and complex lateral connectivity. What’s more, sandstones in the research area manifest a decline in layers and thickness from east to west. The thinner and smaller-scale sandstones in the west have weak lateral connectivity but strong control of oil and water distribution, which results in the formation of concealed lithological reservoir uncontrolled by geological structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The profile {{error of}} a globoidal cam {{resulting}} from motion errors of two coordinated rotational axes {{of a machine}} tool in machining is studied. A novel method of solving profile error is presented. According to this method, the minimum distance from a point on the profile actually machined to the desired profile {{is referred to as}} the profile error. Then, the mathematic model of profile error resulting from the motion errors of the machine tool is built. After that, the type TC 40 globoidal cam is employed as an example to analyze the machining error. The linear influence coefficients of the motion errors of the two coordinated rotational axes on the profile error are determined. The maximum value of the machining errors resulting from the motion errors of the two rotational axes of machine tool is yielded. A novel method of improving the velocity of solving the maximum value by using the linear influence coefficient is presented. At last, an <b>isogram</b> is introduced to analyze the influence of the motion errors of the two coordinated rotational axes of the machine tool on the globoidal cam profile error. Introdcution When a globoidal cam is machining on a NC machine tool, many factors would inevitably contribute to the profile error.
