5|$|Hickenbottom {{was born}} on July 22, 1965 in Chandler, Arizona. The last of four {{children}} – Randy, Scott, and Shari are his older siblings – {{he was raised in}} a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in Reading, Berkshire, England, but grew up in San Antonio, Texas. As a child, Hickenbottom disliked the name Michael, so his family and friends <b>just</b> <b>called</b> him Shawn. Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale {{to death on}} orders from Walt to foil Gus' plot to kill and replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors who have <b>just</b> <b>called</b> the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E

5|$|When Bart is sent by {{his captors}} into town {{to buy a}} case of antifreeze, he sees a gendarme and tries to ask for help, but the gendarme does not {{understand}} English and only gives Bart a piece of candy. Bart walks away, despairing over his own stupidity, then suddenly begins speaking French to himself. Realizing he has become fluent in the language, he runs back to the gendarme and tells him about the winemakers, who are swiftly arrested and Bart finishes his stay in France being hailed as a hero. He is awarded a medal for his bravery and he is kissed by a French beauty queen. Back in Springfield, Adil is caught by the FBI, forcing him to be deported back to Albania {{in exchange for their}} own child spy. Bart returns to his family, bringing them gifts from France. Back at home trying out the gifts, Homer has difficulty opening a wine bottle, but is pleased to hear Bart speak French, oblivious that Bart has <b>just</b> <b>called</b> him a buffoon.|$|E
25|$|The {{format and}} the {{principal}} sponsor were changed in 2001–02 season. State Insurance (more commonly <b>just</b> <b>called</b> 'State') replaced Shell Oil.

25|$|Overtones {{that are}} perfect integer {{multiples}} {{of the fundamental}} are called harmonics.

25|$|Given a {{collection}} of sets, a set which intersects all sets in the collection {{in at least one}} element is called a hitting set, and a simple NP-hard problem is to find a hitting set of smallest size or minimum hitting set.

25|$|Verites is a {{contraction}} of Oliverites (Oliver Walford, School Usher 1838–55) and hence 'Verites' is pronounced {{as if the}} 'Ver' is from Oliver not as from 'very'. The records of the house run back {{to the start of}} the last century, but previously it was <b>just</b> <b>called</b> 'Boarders House No.2'. Girdlestonites' first housemaster was Frederick Girdlestone, who was said to walk like a duck. Girdlestonites has therefore been unofficially known as 'Duckites' ever since, but since this was 'insulting' slang it was never written down or used officially. This latter restriction has now largely fallen by the wayside and even the school magazine uses Duckites in print occasionally.|$|E
25|$|A forging press, often <b>just</b> <b>called</b> a press, is {{used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E
25|$|To a large extent, {{individual}} {{families and}} clans handled their own internal affairs. Where a prominent family {{was associated with}} a certain district, the head of that family would also exercise a kind of authority over his area. Thus, the Master of the Hall or Master of Buckland (the two titles are used interchangeably), hereditary head of the Brandybuck clan, was the effective ruler of Buckland. The title Master of the Hall comes from his more immediate authority over Brandy Hall, the greatest of the dwelling places of the Brandybuck family, filling Buck Hill in Bucklebury. The Master also exercises a good deal of authority in the Marish, a region of the Eastfarthing just across the Brandywine River from Buckland. Similarly, the head of the Took clan, often <b>just</b> <b>called</b> the Took, ruled the ancestral Took dwelling of Great Smials, the village of Tuckborough, and the wider area known as the Tookland.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{ended their}} skid as the month turned to July. Clayton Kershaw allowed only one earned run in 7 innings, while {{striking}} out 9 and the Dodgers {{took advantage of}} 3 Mets errors to pull off an 8–3 victory. Dee Gordon was 2 for 5 with 3 steals and 2 errors in the game. The Dodgers relapsed the next day as the Cincinnati Reds beat them 8–2 for Chad Billingsley's fourth straight loss. The Dodgers came from behind to beat the Reds the next day, as Luis Cruz, <b>just</b> <b>called</b> up from the minors a few days before, doubled in the tie-breaking run {{in the seventh inning}} and stole home for the insurance run in the 3–1 win. On the Fourth of July, Aaron Harang allowed only one run in seven innings to record his first victory since June 7 and the Dodgers won the series with a 4–1 victory in the finale.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{a couple}} of Oxbridge events, student sport has a very low profile in England, however, the largest inter-university sports tournament in Europe, the Roses Tournament (often <b>just</b> <b>called</b> 'Roses') is contested between Lancaster University and the University of York annually. While {{universities}} have significant sports facilities, there is no system of sports scholarships. However, students who are elite standard competitors are eligible for funding from bodies such as UK Sport on the same basis as anyone else. The university most focused on sports provision is probably Loughborough University. Budding professionals in the traditionally working class team sports of football and rugby league rarely go to university. Talented youngsters in the more middle class sports of cricket and rugby union {{are far more likely to}} attend university, but their sports clubs usually play a greater role in developing their talent than their university coaches. Some sports are attempting to adapt to new conditions in which a far higher proportion of English teenagers attend university than in the past, notably cricket, which has established several university centres of excellence.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, since 1968 Beckenbauer, {{has been}} called Der Kaiser by fans and the media. The {{following}} anecdote is told (even by Beckenbauer himself) to explain the origin: On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna, Austria, Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I. The media called him Fußball-Kaiser (football-emperor) afterwards, soon after he was <b>just</b> <b>called</b> Der Kaiser. However, {{according to a report}} in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, this explanation is untrue, though very popular. According to the report, Beckenbauer fouled his opposite number, Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04, in the cup final on 14 June 1969. Disregarding the fans' hooting, Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite part of the field, where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for half a minute. Libuda was commonly called König von Westfalen (king of Westphalia), so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and invented Der Kaiser.|$|E

25|$|Louisville Metro EMS {{utilizes}} {{two levels}} of care providers. EMT-Basics (referred to as technicians or EMTs) and EMT-Paramedics (usually <b>just</b> <b>called</b> paramedics) have drastically different scopes of practice but all exist to provide care and transportation to the sick and injured. A technician specializes in ambulance operation and basic life support care as well assistance to advanced providers. Most technicians have an initial six months of training receiving at least 110 hours of formal classroom training, often reaching or exceeding 120 or 168 hours, with some training institutions requiring initial unspecified numerous clinical hours within a hospital. Basic Emergency Medical Technicians are required to pass skills training and are required to challenge the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians exam to become NREMT certified. Paramedics use complex diagnostics, perform medical procedures, and administer medications and additional advanced care that would otherwise only be provided by an emergency physician. Paramedics in Kentucky generally have three years of initial training including at least 750 hours of internship and clinical instruction in addition to about 1200 hours of formal, classroom instruction. An increasing number of paramedics possess at least an associates degree, many have bachelor's degrees.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I <b>just</b> <b>called</b> everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Philadelphia for a road {{series against the}} two-time defending National League champion Phillies. In the opener, the Dodgers offense finally came alive, scoring a season-high 15 runs in a 15–9 victory. The game featured the first home run since 2007 by outfielder Jay Gibbons, who was <b>just</b> <b>called</b> up from AAA a few days before. In the second game of the series, the bats were silenced by Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt, who shut the Dodgers down 2–0. In the finale, the Dodgers jumped to a 9–2 lead thanks to 6 quality innings by Clayton Kershaw and a four RBI effort from Matt Kemp. However a poor outing from Ronald Belisario in the eighth cut the lead to 9–6 and then Jonathan Broxton was unable to retire a batter in the ninth as the Phillies stormed back for a 10–9 walk-off victory. Next the Dodgers {{traveled to}} Atlanta for a four-game series against the Braves. In the opener, the Dodgers were shut out for the 14th time in the season, this time by Tim Hudson. Hiroki Kuroda allowed just one run in seven innings (a solo home run by Brooks Conrad), {{but it was enough}} as the team lost 1–0. Ted Lilly picked up his third straight win for the Dodgers, as they won the next game 2–1. The Dodgers string of impressive performances from their starting pitchers was ended on August 15, when Vicente Padilla was pounded for eight runs in 4 inning and the Dodgers lost a blow-out 13–1. In the series finale, the Dodgers wasted another gem from Chad Billingsley as the bullpen blew another lead, allowing three runs in the ninth inning to fall 4–3 as Melky Cabrera hit a two-run bases-loaded walk-off single off Octavio Dotel.|$|E
