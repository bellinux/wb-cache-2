5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space to the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subspaces, and the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection of the subspaces.|$|E

The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952.

5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E
