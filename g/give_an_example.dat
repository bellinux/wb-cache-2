25|$|An {{algebraic}} variety can {{be neither}} affine nor projective. To <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> let X = P1 × A1 and p: X → A1 the projection. It is an algebraic variety {{since it is}} a product of varieties. It is not affine since P1 is a closed subvariety of X (as the zero locus of p) but an affine variety cannot contain a projective variety of positive dimension as a closed subvariety. It is not projective either since there is a nonconstant regular function on X; namely, p.|$|E
25|$|Polyandrous {{relations}} are disapproved of inmost expressions of Hinduism.There {{is at least}} one reference to polyandry in the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, as this is what she chose in a previous life. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of polyandry, accepting this as her way of life. However, in the same epic, when questioned by Kunti to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of polyandry, Yudhishthira cites Gautam-clan Jatila (married to seven Saptarishis) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers), thereby implying a more open attitude toward polyandry in Vedic society.|$|E
25|$|To <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E

25|$|Of his contributions, the {{development}} of Ramsey theory {{and the application of}} the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erdős found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erdős and Selberg. Erdős also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional.|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{informed}} of the indictment, he urged his followers not to take any action {{if he was going}} to be sentenced to less than six months in prison, stressing that he wanted to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of dignity, but ordered a group of Legionaries to defend him in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Şerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of April 16. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when all those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).|$|E
25|$|It {{is popular}} with school {{children}} in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, specially the Backbenchers occupying {{the last few}} rows, who most often play it sneakily during the ongoing class, a favorite childhood nostalgia of adults to reminisce about. It has several variants and is mostly played by two players. The runs are scored by flipping the book open at random and the last digit of the right-side (even-numbered) page is counted {{as the number of}} runs scored. 0 (and sometimes 8) are assigned to special rules, typically a wicket is lost when a person scores 0 and scoring 8 would be substituted for a No ball run and an additional chance. To <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> if the batting side opened the book at page 26, then 6 runs would be scored. For the toss, what is generally done is that both the players open a page and the one whose last digit is greater wins.|$|E

Command and Control Central (CCC) at Kontum, also {{commanded by}} a lieutenant colonel, used 30 teams and one exploitation battalion.

To <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> {{of the cost of}} such operations, during the year 20 Americans were killed, 199 wounded, and nine went missing in the Prairie Fire area. Casualties among the Special Commando Units (SCUs – pronounced Sues), as the indigenous mercenaries were titled, were: 57 killed, 270 wounded, and 31 missing. Command and Control South (CCS) at Ban Me Thuot , also commanded by a lieutenant colonel, consisted of 30 teams and an exploitation battalion. Since the use of exploitation forces was forbidden in Cambodia, these troops were utilized in securing launch sites, providing installation security, and conducting in-country missions. During the year, 454 reconnaissance operations were conducted in Cambodia.|$|E
