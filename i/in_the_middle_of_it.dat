5|$|The lengthy {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a climb <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but no KOM points were on offer.

Midway through the stage, the riders took on {{the difficulty of the}} day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed {{over and over again}} until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all.|$|E

500|$|In his {{interview}} with Bev Vincent, Isanove opined that Walter was his favorite character to draw; [...] "Jae [...] established him as almost androgynous. He's always got this bare chest, and he's very feminine {{in the way he}} moves, with his hands raised. He's always moving his hands around. He's got this weird face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He's starting to bald, but he's always got a very white separation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He's just so greasy, he's great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can't make him repulsive... He's such a great character." ...|$|E
500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to sort of, like, cut its legs out. Which I think is a lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E
500|$|The current gardens to {{the south}} of the castle date from around 1530; they occupy , and include two sunken areas, {{separated}} by a walkway. The eastern area may have been intended to imitate defensive bastion works, and it originally featured a circular brick tower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The site would originally have had a brick wall running all the way around it, of which only the south-east edge survives. Two brick towers survive at the southern corners, one resembling a clover-leaf, the other with an octagonal design, and would have originally been used as banqueting houses. Beyond the gardens would have been an area planted with trees, called [...] "the wilderness", and smaller compartmented garden and ponds. A triangular building called [...] "the Mount" [...] was built in the wilderness in the early 17th century, and is now a private house. John Goodall considers them to be [...] "one of the best-preserved and most important early Tudor gardens in England".|$|E
50|$|There is a {{courtyard}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastery that measure 42.38 meter *41.16 meter. Three rooms located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middles</b> <b>of</b> east, west and south wings {{were used as}} prayer rooms.|$|R

500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look at it that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even though {{attendance}} far surpassed {{what the}} WUO and PFOC had anticipated, the conference became a political disaster.

She began to pull away from the WUO.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with E! Online, assistant director and producer of Terminator Salvation, Bruce Franklin, {{said it was an}} isolated incident. [...] "If you are working in a very intense scene and someone takes you out of your groove ... It was the most emotional scene in the movie ... and for him to get stopped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He is very intensely involved in his character. He didn't walk around like that all day long. It was just a moment and it passed", Franklin said.|$|E

25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palms {{of my hands}} a red mark appeared, {{about the size of}} a penny, accompanied by acute pain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red marks. The pain was more pronounced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.|$|R

2500|$|Lin and Shu {{proposed}} in 1964 that the arms were not material in nature, but instead {{made up of}} areas of greater density, similar to a traffic jam on a highway. [...] The cars move through the traffic jam: the density of cars increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] The traffic jam itself, however, does not move (or not a great deal, {{in comparison to the}} cars). [...] In the galaxy, stars, gas, dust, and other components move through the density waves, are compressed, and then move out of them.|$|E
2500|$|Hunter left The Apex Group in 1958, {{just before}} they {{recorded}} their first single [...] "Yorkshire Relish, Caravan" [...] for John Lever Records. Hunter played in a few local groups, but eventually his financial situation forced a change. [...] "I wasn't making my hire-purchase payments, and 'little jobs' were getting done and people were getting smacked. I was never <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but I was always somewhere in the area." [...] He returned to Shrewsbury, ostensibly to become more responsible in his personal life, and settled down {{enough to have a}} steady girlfriend in Diane Coles. Outside of his day job, he and Tony Wardle formed a harmonica duo inspired by Morton Fraser's Harmonica Gang, a local variety act.|$|E
2500|$|Hedrick caused {{controversy}} when {{he insisted}} Shani Davis, fellow American speed skater in the 1,000m race, should {{have participated in}} the men's pursuit, stating, [...] "I don't see what his logic is. We can't be beat if he skates. It's his decision. I'm not going to get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I would like him to be in the pursuit, but am I going to beg him? No." [...] Five-time gold medalist and Olympic-team physician, Eric Heiden, has publicly written that Davis made the right choice in not participating in the team pursuit and thereby not jeopardizing his chances at a gold medal in his best event, the 1,000 meter race. Davis eventually won the gold medal in the 1000 m race, while Hedrick finished sixth.|$|E
5000|$|The jingle was: [...] "Smack dab <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Smack dab <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Smack dab <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gum is {{the secret}} to Chewels' sugarless fun, a delicious center filling where others have none, smack dab <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gum." ...|$|R
