40|$|A {{self-priming}} and photosensitive aqueous-base-developable benzocyclobutene (BCB) -based {{dielectric material}} curable in air is described. The polymer {{is made from}} divinylsiloxane benzocyclobutene and BCB-acrylic acid. Patterned films have high resolution, and via openings are scum-free without a <b>descum</b> operation. Whether cured in nitrogen or in air, the formulation produces a film with optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties desired for many microelectronic applications, such as packaging applications and a planarization layer or insulation layer in display applications...|$|E
40|$|A positive-tone and aqueous-base-developable benzocyclobutene (BCB) -based {{dielectric}} material curable in air {{is described in}} this paper. The prepolymer is made from divinylsiloxane bisbenzocyclobutene (DVS-bisBCB) and BCB-acrylic acid. The formulation contains antioxidants that allow the prepolymer to cure in air and a diazonaphthaquinone to make it photosensitive. Patterned films have high resolution, and via openings are scum-free without a <b>descum</b> operation. Whether cured in nitrogen or in air, the prepolymer produces a film with optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties desirable for many microelectronic applications, such as packaging applications and as a planarization or insulation layer in display applications...|$|E
40|$|Feature {{resolution}} in BCB is compared for hard contact and proximity exposure modes. It is {{found that the}} proximity exposure mode yields better resolution. This indicates that the limiting factor for critical feature size resolution is something other than film thickness. In addition, {{it is found that}} film loss during develop and cure is greater for wafers exposed using proximity. This effect is greatly exaggerated when the density of BCB features on the wafer is low. The density of BCB features also impacts the film loss during the plasma <b>descum</b> step. By taking all of these factors into consideration the desired film thickness and process uniformity is maintained...|$|E
40|$|Bimetallic thermal resist Bi/In {{has shown}} many {{applications}} {{in the areas of}} microfabrication, photomasks and data storage. Optical modeling shows that this class of thermal resists is wavelength invariant, and Bi/In can perform even better at 13. 4 nm than at 248 nm due to the increase of absorption and the reduction of reflection. Images were successfully made on Bi/In films with both proximity (0. 5 mm) and projection exposures with Nd-YAG laser running at 2 nd harmonic wavelength. A new kind of developing solution (HCl:H 2 O 2 :H 2 O= 1 : 1 : 48) used at room temperature was found to be more effective in <b>descumming</b> than nitric acetic acid solution. Both have the etching selectivity of unexposed area to exposed area> 60 : 1. Developed Bi/In resist shows good conductivity, which can be used as both a metal plating masking and seeding layer. 2 to 10 µm wide Cu and Ni lines and squares were successfully plated on the developed Bi/In patterns on glass slides and silicon wafers. Shelf test shows that the properties of Bi/In film do not change after being kept in a humid temperature-lifted environment for 10 days. Large optical transmission changes (OD> 3. 5 before laser exposure and < 0. 3 after exposure) indicate Bi/In can be used for direct-write photomasks and data storage media. Heat-treatment enhances the OD exposed/unexposed OD change...|$|R
40|$|Grass ’ {{formation}} {{is the very}} common defects for via etch process when using a BCl 3 /Cl 2 as basic gases in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system. Presence of grass can potentially degrade device performance due to poor metallization coverage. In this study we found that grass formation strongly depends on GaAs surface condition prior to etch. Any surface contaminants, such as photo resist residues and/or scumming can contribute to grass formation. We found that applying suitable chemical clean and O 2 plasma <b>descum</b> prior to via etch process would prevent the grass formation. To avoid changes to via profile and/or etch rate, etch parameters were not altered in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of current collapse is a limiting {{factor in the}} performance of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), and can be ameliorated by the deposition of a silicon nitride passivation film on the surface. The effect of three types of surface cleaning prior to the application of a silicon nitride passivation layer are studied. The best results were obtained when the wafers were cleaned using an air plasma <b>descum</b> followed by an HCl dip prior to the deposition of the silicon nitride passivation. Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling indicated that the degree of collapse was correlated with the amount of residual carbon contamination at the silicon nitride/AlGaN interface.

40|$|The dry {{development}} of 0. 25 p. m diffusion-enhanced silylated resist structures produced in a LAM Research Corporation TCPTM 9400 TM {{inductively coupled plasma}} etcher is studied. The processes consist of a low-selectivity, C 2 F 6 -containing, <b>descum</b> step followed by an oxygen-based main and overetch step. An extensive study, based on statistically designed experiments, shows the effect of different process parameters on anisotropy, selectivity, and the etch rates of sily-lated and unsilylated resist that occur when using different dry development chemistries. Solutions that independently control and enhance the selectivity and the anisotropy, while maintaining vertical profiles and acceptable etch rates, are demonstrated. Optimal processes for the different chemistries are compared. The effect that the different chemistries exert on the lithographic performance is quantified, and the strong reduction of the proximity effect, {{both in terms of}} linewidth and profiles, resulting from SO 2 addition is studied. It has been demonstrated that the results also apply to sub- 0. 2 5 p. m geometries and that none of the tested chemistries interfere with subsequent etching of the polysilicon substrate...|$|E
30|$|After the etching of Si 3 N 4, the PMMA and Cr {{remained}} on the sample need to be removed. The removing process was as follows: the sample was immersed in the acetone, and ultrasonic was used to speed the dissolve, and then the sample was rinsed by acetone, IPA, DI water, and IPA in sequence. Chromium etchant from Sigma-Aldrich {{was used to remove}} remained Cr. The wet etching speed was about 40  Å per minute at room temperature. With the fabricated grating structures, the inlets and outlets of PC-based nanofluidic structure were sculptured with photolithography, backside alignment, and etching in sequence. A 5 -in. ferric oxide photo mask was fabricated and been used as photomask for photolithography. The photolithography process was as follows: (1) patterned Si wafer were cleaned by piranha process and O 2 plasma for 1  min at 300  W: (2) prebake at 110  °C for 2  min; (3) cooling 30  s on the cooling plate; (4) <b>descum</b> with O 2 plasma at 250  W, 150  mTorr for 1  min, (5) spin coating HMDS and SPR- 220 in sequence at 3000  rpm for 30  s respectively, and the thickness of the SPR- 220 will be 5 um; (6) soft bake at 60  °C for 2  min and 110  °C for 1  min; (7) backside alignment and exposure with i-line photolithography from EVG 620 aligner. The photolithography dose was 180  mJ/cm 2 with vacuum contact and 50  μm separation distance, (8) 1 : 5 mixture of AZ 400  K and DI water as developer for exposed SPR- 220; (9) the wafer was cleaned by DI water and N 2 gas. With the SPR- 220 patterns {{on the back of the}} patterned wafer, the inlets and outlets were fabricated by etch through the Si and SiO 2 from the SPR- 220 patterned side of Si wafer.|$|E
