The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67mg/kg (dry wt soil) and an average PAH concentration of 18mg/kg (dry wt soil) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88mg/kg and <b>fluoranthene</b> and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAH. Benzopyrene (BaP) the most toxic of the parent PAH is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments; the [...] normal background concentration of BaP in the London urban sites was 6.9mg/kg (dry wt soils). London soils contained more stable 4-6 ring PAH which were indicative of combustion/pyrolytic sources such as coal/oil burning and traffic sourced particulates.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and structural}} {{characterization of the}} double-stranded carbon skeleton of a C 84 fullerenes belt region has been achieved. The synthetic methodology described is based on cyclic dimerization of diastereomeric AB-type monomers by non diastereospecific Diels-Alder reaction with isobenzofuran and acenaphthylene groups as reactive termini. Four diasteromeric monomer precursors have been prepared, using dihydropyracylene {{for the first time}} in a multi-step synthesis. The synthesis of dihydropyracylene itself has been optimized. This hydrocarbon, which shows essential structural features of the fullerenes was made available on the 10 g scale. The dimerization of the monomers showed a remarkable concentration independence under certain conditions, to give good yields of the cyclic dimer even in bulk. The belt-shaped macrocycle obtained from dimerization of the monomers has been partly aromatized by acid catalyzed dehydration reaction. This partly aromatized macrocycle differs from the fully unsatured belt by two ?water? molecules. Semiempirical AM 1 calculations on electronic and thermodynamic properties of cyclic <b>fluoranthenes,</b> linear <b>fluoranthenes,</b> and cyclacens revealed strain energy as the essential reason for the incomplete aromatization. X-ray crystallographic structures in the crystals of the macrocycles, one of the monomers, and two diasteromeric epoxybenzo[k]fluoranthenes are also given.

It was shown that singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and SOMO- 1 of a diradical structure occupy different parts of space with a small shared region, resulting in a spin density distribution over the entire molecule. The spatial diradical distribution in the singlet diradical structures was examined by inspecting the HOMOs and LUMOs for a and b spin electrons. It was shown that the a-HOMO and the b-LUMO (as well as the b-HOMO and the a-LUMO) occupy practically the same part of space. In this way, there are no unpaired electrons in a singlet diradical structure, yet two of them occupy different parts of space, thus allowing the p-electrons to delocalize...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of fluorene, a {{polycyclic hydrocarbon}} {{which is not}} a substrate for fungal lignin peroxidase, was studied in liquid cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and in vitro with P. chrysosporium extracellular enzymes. Intact fungal cultures metabolized fluorene to 9 -hydroxyfluorene via 9 -fluorenone. Some conversion to more-polar products was also observed. Oxidation of fluorene to 9 -fluorenone was also obtained in vitro in a system that contained manganese(II), unsaturated fatty acid, and either crude P. chrysosporium peroxidases or purified recombinant manganese peroxidase. The oxidation of fluorene in vitro was inhibited by the free-radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene but not by the lignin peroxidase inhibitor NaVO(inf 3). Manganese(III) -malonic acid complexes could not oxidize fluorene. These results indicate that fluorene oxidation in vitro was a consequence of lipid peroxidation mediated by P. chrysosporium manganese peroxidase. The rates of fluorene and diphenylmethane disappearance in vitro were significantly faster than those of true polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or <b>fluoranthenes,</b> whose rates of disappearance were ionization potential dependent.

Forty-one APAHs were found and divided into six groups which were alkyl naphthalenes (ANAs), alkyl phenanthrenes (APHs), alkyl anthracenes (AANs), alkyl <b>fluoranthenes</b> (AFLs), alkyl pyrenes (APYs) and alkyl chrysenes (ACHs).

40|$|Tar bitumens are {{increasingly}} {{being used as a}} binder in road works. They consist of a standard product of about 70 % bitumen and 25 - 30 % tar. Tar bitumens are classifiable as the pyrolysis products of organic materials and are applied hot. Depending on the temperature used there are emissions of various intensities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), some of which are carcinogenic. A total of 250 one hour air samples was taken at breathing height on 20 days at 11 road works sites. The region of road paving operations in the immediate neighbourhood of the finishing machine operator and the screedmen were the chosen sampling points. A total of 19 unsubstituted chromatography/mass spectrometry. These included benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, and indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd]pyrene, all of which are carcinogenic. The median concentrations of chrysene and of benzo[b,j + k] <b>fluoranthenes</b> (determined en masse) were 9. 3 and 2. 8 micrograms/m 3 respectively.

Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene had the lowest median concentration with about 0. 03 micrograms/m 3. Of the resulting shift means, the BaP concentration was over 1 microgram/m 3 in about 50 % of the cases, over 2 micrograms/m 3 in 35 %, and over 5 micrograms/m 3 in about 15 %. Even when the temperature of the paving mix was only between 120 degrees and 135 degrees C. 4. 8 % of the concentrations (identical to 3 samples) were greater than 2 micrograms BaP/m 3, this value was exceeded in 34. 9 % of the determinations (identical to 30 samples) when the temperature of the tar bitumen was between 135 degrees and 150 degrees C.
