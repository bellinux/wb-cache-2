40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} human gut metaproteomic dataset {{deposited}} in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the <b>dataset</b> <b>identifier</b> PXD 001573. Ten aliquots of a single stool sample collected from a healthy human volunteer were either pretreated by differential centrifugation (DC; N= 5) or not centrifuged (NC; N= 5). Protein extracts were then processed by filter-aided sample preparation, single-run liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry, and peptide identification was carried out using Sequest-HT as search engine within the Proteome Discoverer informatic platform. The dataset described here is also related to the research article entitled “Enrichment or depletion? The impact of stool pretreatment on metaproteomic characterization of the human gut microbiota” published in Proteomics (Tanca et al., 2015), [1]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{recently}} {{identified the}} long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) TRPM 2 -AS {{as a key}} regulator of survival in prostate cancer [1]. This essential role, coupled to the TRPM 2 -AS low-expression levels in healthy tissues, makes this ncRNA a suitable therapeutic target for further clinical studies. To get insights into the survival mechanism controlled by this molecule, we ablated its expression in prostate cancer cells and performed a genome-wide analysis of the transcripts differentially regulated in dying cells. Here, we describe in detail the experimental system, methods and quality control for the generation of the microarray data associated with our recent publication [1]. The data are related to [1]. Data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database repository with the <b>dataset</b> <b>identifier</b> GSE 40687...|$|R
