5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{increase}} in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E

50|$|To use {{the example}} of a {{physical}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet,</b> if the separate drawers in the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> are represented as the highest level of sub-directories in the file system or system prompt, then the room the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most operating systems, files can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> within the room.|$|R
25|$|A <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> is a {{piece of}} office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the <b>cabinet.</b> The vertical <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|R

25|$|In the past, these medical reports {{consisted}} of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were {{added in the}} patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or triplicate by means of carbon copy.|$|E

25|$|The Culture has {{achieved}} artificial intelligences where each Mind has thought processing capabilities many {{orders of magnitude}} beyond that of human beings, and data storage drives which, if written out on paper and stored in <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> would cover thousands of planets skyscraper high (as described by one Mind in Consider Phlebas). Yet it has managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilizations sometimes occur in timeframes as short as microseconds, and standard Orbital Minds are capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{medical records}} have changed considerably. Although many {{physicians}} and hospitals still maintain paper records, {{there is a}} drive for electronic records. <b>Filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources {{but also as a}} working platform. Technology has gotten so sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.|$|E

2500|$|The American {{historian}} Cornelius Partsch noted some striking {{aspects of}} Meissner's book {{such as his}} complete exoneration of the Auswärtiges Amt from any involvement in the criminal aspects of the Nazi regime; he has Sorge constantly breaking into offices to steal information, which he did not, as security at the German embassy was sloppy and Sorge was trusted as an apparently dedicated Nazi journalist, making breaking into offices unnecessary; and he avoided any mention of SS Standartenführer Josef Albert Meisinger, the [...] "Butcher of Warsaw" [...] who was stationed at the German Embassy as the police attache to Japan. Partsch wrote Meissner gave Sorge almost superhuman abilities at lock-breaking as he broke into various offices, safes, and <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> with the greatest ease while in reality secret documents were all too {{left out in the}} open in unlocked rooms and Sorge was allowed to wander about the embassy without escort. Likewise, Meissner portrayed the [...] Auswärtiges Amt in the traditional manner, as a glamorous, elitist group who operated in exotic places like Japan serving the Fatherland, not the Nazi regime.|$|E
