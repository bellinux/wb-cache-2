5|$|They are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{and sometimes}} eat carrion, making them {{one of the}} few snakes to do so. Campbell and Lamar (2004) described having seen them feeding on fish heads and viscera that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the water from a dock. Heinrich and Studenroth (1996) reported an occasion in which an individual was seen feeding on the butchered remains of a feral hog (Sus scrofa) that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into Cypress Creek.|$|E
5|$|As in {{previous}} years, the spectators tried to assist their preferred riders {{by trying to}} impede their opponents.

5|$|Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and {{included}} jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, {{rather than being}} thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, where it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{assigned}} Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. On April 5 Seward <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> {{from his}} carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, {{and a broken}} arm. On {{the night of the}} assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park. Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War) and a Bowie knife.|$|E
5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered and {{identified in the}} twentieth century, a folk motif came {{to be associated with}} it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone block, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E

The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around their necks with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tunnel}} after the match tempers boiled over between staff of both clubs. A slice of pizza <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 {{years after the}} incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and its vast wealth have been told and retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into his yard in Washington.|$|E

5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he knelt down, holding the cross in position until enough earth <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> in the hole to make it stand firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Having {{reached a}} hill behind his army's {{original}} position, Alexios began to regroup his army from the units that had broken. He sent out messengers to rally his scattered men with news that Bryennios had been killed, showing his parade horse as evidence. At the same time, the promised Turkish reinforcements began {{arriving at the}} scene, lifting his men's morale. All the while, on the battlefield, Bryennios's army had closed around Alexios's Franks, who dismounted and offered to surrender. In the process the rebel army had become totally disordered, with units mixed and their formations disordered. Bryennios's reserves <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> in confusion by the Pecheneg attack, while his front lines relaxed, thinking that the battle was over.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E
