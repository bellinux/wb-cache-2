40|$|Like any {{material}} made from wood fibers, paper also exhibits dimensional changes {{as a result}} of variations in moisture content. This property, called <b>hygroexpansivity,</b> is very important both in the papermaking and in the printing processes. The present work studies the <b>hygroexpansivity</b> of reprographic paper produced with eucalyptus kraft pulp, measuring this property during the process in an industrial paper machine. The study was developed using 75 g/m 2 paper samples collected in different positions of a commercial paper machine running at a speed of 1256 m/min. Paper samples were collected along the paper machine, from the forming section up to the finishing section, and also along the cross machine direction at the reel. Besides <b>hygroexpansivity,</b> other physical properties of the paper samples were measured: grammmage, thickness, bulk, porosity, filler content, TSI (tensile stiffness index), TEA (tensile energy absorption), stretch, tensile index, tensile stiffness, breaking length, modulus of elasticity, tear strength and burst strength. The analysis of the results reveals the effect on <b>hygroexpansivity</b> of the operations and treatments involved in the papermaking process (formation, pressing, drying and finishing). The results are discussed with special emphasis on the correlations between <b>hygroexpansivity</b> and the other aforementioned properties...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{products}} show dimensional changes when {{subjected to}} moisture content modification. <b>Hygroexpansivity</b> {{was investigated in}} a commercial paper machine operating at 1256 m/min {{by a set of}} measurements on 75 g/m(2) reprographic bleached eucalyptus pulp paper samples. The present work shows <b>hygroexpansivity</b> development in different sections of the paper machine along the manufacturing direction. The measurement results demonstrate the effects of papermaking process operations on paper <b>hygroexpansivity</b> and lead to the confirmation of fiber orientation degree, drying restraint and shrinkage and paper tension as significant influencing factors. Structural, strength and elastic properties of paper were also measured as a function of machine direction position and presented for discussion purposes...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the effect of fiber characteristics, especially fiber wall thickness, on the hygroexpansion behavior of paper due to humidity changes. Five different eucalyptus Kraft pulp samples were studied with an OPTIDIM <b>hygroexpansivity</b> tester. As a reference, birch and acacia were included. In all, seven pulp samples were refined at low consistency (LC), using a Voith Sulzer refiner. Both anisotropic and isotropic sheets were investigated. The sheets were dried under restraint. The results showed that fiber wall thickness {{is an important factor in}} controlling the <b>hygroexpansivity</b> of paper through fiber network activation...|$|E
40|$|Dimensional instability, more {{particularly}} its component <b>hygroexpansivity,</b> may cause problems in process or end-use {{situations in which}} paper or board is in contact with water or subject to changes in ambient relative humidity. Misregistration in printing, curl during copying and calender wrinkles are examples of such defects. In this paper, the in-plane <b>hygroexpansivity</b> of oriented laboratory sheets with different pulps and dried both freely and under restraint is studied. A linear relationship between the drying shrinkage and hygroexpansion coefficient of freely dried laboratory sheets having different fiber orientation anisotropies, was observed. Regardless of both the measurement direction (MD or CD) and the drying options (freely or restraint) all hygroexpansion coefficient values of each pulp type fell quite well on one single power curve {{as a function of}} the elastic modulus. Fiber orientation is considered via two different approaches: using fiber orientation anisotropy and using directional variable named as anisotropy index. When the anisotropy index is used, the MD and CD <b>hygroexpansivity</b> or the MD and CD drying shrinkage can be fit on a single curve, while the freely dried and restraint-dried sheets evidently need two different fitting curves. Between the hygroexpansion coefficient and the anisotropy index, a simple power law relationship, with two fitting parameters depending on pulp and drying restraints, is introduced...|$|E
40|$|We report {{numerical}} simulations oil shrinkage in a fiber network {{when the}} fibers shrink more in their transverse to length direction than the axial direction. The effect of network density and anisotropic fiber properties on sheet shrinkage, elastic modulus and segment strain distributions is explored. The macroscopic free shrinkage follows a simple mathematical expression {{that is consistent}} with the <b>hygroexpansivity</b> theory of Uesaka. The shrinkage of fiber segments agrees qualitatively with the microscopic measurements of Nanko and Wu. In addition, we found that in free drying the mean length changes of free and bonded fiber segments are almost independent of network density...|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensional}} stability of superheated steam dried paper made from groundwood, thermomechanical, chemithermomechanical and bleached kraft pulps were investigated {{in terms of}} <b>hygroexpansivity,</b> drying shrinkage and wet expansion. For all the pulps tested these characteristics of {{dimensional stability}} {{were found to be}} improved by high temperature superheated steam drying. The hygroexpansion coefficient, the dimensional change relative to paper moisture content, was reduced about 15 % by superheated steam drying at 320 °C, compared to paper dried in low temperature air. Irreversible shrinkage was reduced by up to 30 % for sheets dried in superheated steam. However, these effects on <b>hygroexpansivity</b> were caused mainly by the high drying temperature and the resulting high drying rate regardless of the drying fluid. Drying shrinkage and wet expansion as well were reduced by about 10 % and 15 % respectively for paper dried in superheated steam. In superheated steam drying the elevated web temperature at the start of drying is believed to affect paper properties through thermal softening of the lignin and relaxation of drying and wet-pressing stresses. Increased fiber bonding with softened lignin accounts for both the increased elastic modulus and decreased light scattering coefficient observed. These were obtained only for sheets from mechanical pulps with initial moisture content of about 0. 4 kg-water/kg-fiber or more, consistent with the mechanism of thermal softening of plasticized lignin. High sheet temperature in the falling rate period improves hygroscopicity of paper through reducing its equilibrium moisture content. Superheated steam drying improves the dimensional stability of paper from such pulps, including less anisotropy, thereby enhancing paper quality...|$|E
40|$|An {{in-plane}} elasto-plastic material {{model and}} a <b>hygroexpansivity</b> model were ap­plied for paper. The input parameters for both models are fiber orientation and dry solids content. A {{finite element model}} was constructed offering possibilities for studying different structural variations of an orthotropic sheet as well as buckling behavior and internal stress situations under through-thickness strain differences. Examples related to the curl and web­fluting phenomena of paper are presented. Both studied cases {{presented in this paper}} indicates the usefulness of the hygro-elasto-plastic model in predicting the challenging deformation phe­nomena of orthotropic paper sheets. The application possibilities of the hygro-elasto-plastic model are diverse, including the investigation into several phenomena and defects appearing in drying, converting and printing process conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and hygroscopic properties {{of paper and}} board are factors affecting the whole lifecycle of a product, including paper/board quality, production, converting, and material and energy savings. The progress of shrinkage profiles, loose edges of web, baggy web causing wrinkling and misregistration in printing are examples of factors affecting runnability and end product quality in the drying section and converting processes, where paper or board is treated as a moving web. The structural properties and internal stresses or plastic strain differences built up during production also cause the end-product defects related to distortion of {{the shape of the}} product such as sheet or box. The objective of this work was to construct a model capable of capturing the characteristic behavior of hygroscopic orthotropic material under moisture change, during different external in-plane stretch or stress conditions. Two independent experimental models were constructed: the elasto-plastic material model and the hygroexpansivity-shrinkage model. Both describe the structural properties of the sheet with a fiber orientation probability distribution, and both are functions of the dry solids content and fiber orientation anisotropy index. The anisotropy index, introduced in this work, simplifies the procedure of determining the constitutive parameters of the material model and the hygroexpansion coefficients in different in-plane directions of the orthotropic sheet. The mathematically consistent elasto-plastic material model and the dry solids content dependent <b>hygroexpansivity</b> have been constructed over the entire range from wet to dry. The presented elastoplastic and hygroexpansivity-shrinkage models can be used in an analytical approach to estimate the plastic strain and shrinkage in simple one-dimensional cases. For studies of the combined and more complicated effects of hygro-elasto-plastic behavior, both models were implemented in a finite element program for a numerical solution. The finite element approach also offered possibilities for studying different structural variations of orthotropic planar material, as well as local buckling behavior and internal stress situations of the sheet or web generated by local strain differences. A comparison of the simulation examples presented in this work to results published earlier confirms that the hygro-elasto-plastic model provides at least qualitatively reasonable estimates. The application potential of the hygro-elasto-plastic model is versatile, including several phenomena and defects appearing in the drying, converting and end-use conditions of the paper or board webs and products, or in other corresponding complex planar materials...|$|E
