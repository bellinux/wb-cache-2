50|$|A tough {{second round}} <b>draw</b> <b>pitted</b> Barrowside trained by Jack Harvey {{alongside}} Pauls Fun; Barrowside a leading hurdler had gained {{entry into the}} Derby after winning the last trial stake. The race caused a surprise when Pauls Fun missed the break and Barrowside won comfortably. After the race Leslie Reynolds announced that Pauls Fun has tweaked a muscle {{and it would be}} a race against time to be fit for the semi-finals to be held just twodays later. However in the semi-finals Pauls Fun took his place and won comfortably by six and a half-lengths setting a new track record of 28.64 in the process. Barrowside in the same heat failed to progress finishing in fourth place. Title Role at odds of 4-11 could only manage third after a crowded second semi-final race won by Ashcroft Boy.|$|R
50|$|That win saw UCD {{qualify for}} European {{competition}} - the European Cup Winners Cup - {{for the first}} time. The <b>draw</b> <b>pitted</b> them against Everton, {{then one of the}} leading sides in England and boasting players of the calibre of Neville Southall, Kevin Sheedy, Graham Sharp, Peter Reid and Andy Gray. The home leg was played in Tolka Park and a crowd of 9,000 - many times UCD’s average league crowd - saw the Students come away with a scarcely believable 0-0 draw. Another remarkable performance was to follow two weeks later as a solitary Graham Sharp goal gave Everton a 1-0 win. Joe Hanrahan skimmed the bar for the Students late on; had he scored, UCD would have progressed on away goals - as it was, Everton {{went on to win the}} entire competition, and smashed several records in winning their nation's league title. UCD's performance was made all the more remarkable by the fact that at the end of the year Everton were voted the best club side in the World for 1985, by the managers of world national teams.|$|R

50|$|The {{championship}} <b>draw</b> <b>pitted</b> Dublin against Kerry in the All-Ireland semi-final on 1 September 2013. Michael Darragh Macauley and Bernard Brogan struck {{early for}} the Dubs, but they were knocked back by James O'Donoghue’s seventh-minute goal. Donnchadh Walsh fired in a second goal four minutes later from a Darran O'Sullivan assist. 60 seconds later Diarmuid Connolly floated in a tantalising delivery from the left, and a flying Paul Mannion rose to punch to the net past a helpless Brendan Kealy. Dublin conceded a third goal in the 20th minute when Stephen Cluxton hauled down Walsh, and O’Donoghue drilled home the penalty for a three points advantage. Both sides exchanged several points as Kerry held a 3-5 to 1-9 half-time advantage. Having conceded five points in a row, Kerry regained their composure. Twice they went level through Colm Cooper and O’Donoghue, before Darran O’Sullivan streered over the lead point from a tight angle in the 63rd minute. But there was another fascinating twist in this memorable encounter, as Dublin cut loose with a devastating 2-2 salvo in the closing stages. Kevin McManamon plundered possession 50 metres out to drive through and plant the perfect shot past Kealy, and in stoppage time Eoghan O'Gara’s drive smashed against the crossbar and over the line for a 3-18 to 3-11 victory.|$|R

The 2004 Tiger Cup <b>draw</b> <b>pitted</b> Singapore against Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos and co-hosts Vietnam in Group A. Despite a record of four wins in eighteen matches, the FAS gave their assurance that Avramović would not be sacked even if he {{failed to meet the}} target of reaching the tournament final. His Tiger Cup squad included naturalised players Daniel Bennett, Agu Casmir and Itimi Dickson. Singapore drew 1–1 with Vietnam in their opening match, following it up with a 2–2 stalemate against Indonesia. A 6–2 win over Laos and a 3–0 defeat of Cambodia ensured their passage to the semi-finals as group runners-up. Singapore faced Myanmar in the semi-finals, registering a 4–3 win in the first leg in a game where first-choice striker Indra Sahdan was suspended and questions were raised over the eligibility of a Myanmar player. A 4–2 extra-time win over 8-man Myanmar in the home leg put the Lions through to the finals where they faced Indonesia. Singapore achieved a 3–1 win at Senayan in the first leg, followed by a 2–1 win at Kallang on 16 January 2005. Singapore clinched the trophy on home soil and their second international title after their 1998 tournament triumph. The Lions were honoured for their Cup win with the Team of the Year award at the Singapore Sports Awards 2005.|$|R

50|$|At Serima, Groeber {{was able}} {{to build up a}} {{congregation}} with more than a thousand local converts, while also mobilizing them to provide support and labor to develop the mission station. A large complex, including a boarding school and church, were built over two decades, using bricks fired in a massive kiln. Students with an aptitude for construction were given scholarships and worked in the afternoons. By 1956 the school was built, and Groeber moved on to the construction of St. Mary's Church. This church combined the use of a modern architectural plan (inspired in part by the Federal Charter Archive) with African carving and artwork in the interior spaces. All the Serima artists were trained from scratch by Groeber and his former pupil Cornelius Manguma. These artists, plucked from mandatory art classes, worked in the afternoons, and were trained in <b>drawing,</b> patterning, <b>pit</b> firing, and woodcarving. Once Groeber was satisfied with their technical abilities, they were assigned subjects to carve for the St. Mary's interior. The students were expected to create their own designs, which were approved if they fit in with the overall iconography.|$|R

Underlying these hard questions is the issue of justification in view of a plurality of cultural and religious traditions around the globe. If human rights can be transformed so as to defy the charge of Euro-centrism (of being parochially rooted in only one cultural and religious tradition), they need to creatively <b>draw</b> on, not <b>pit</b> themselves against, this plurality.

50|$|Tenniel {{became a}} student of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1842 by probation—he was {{admitted}} because he made several copies of classical sculptures to provide the necessary admission portfolio. So, it was here that Tenniel returned to his earlier independent education. While Tenniel's more formal training at the Royal Academy and at other institutions was beneficial in nurturing his artistic ambitions, it failed in Tenniel's mind because he disagreed with the school's teaching methods, resulting in Tenniel educating himself for his career. Tenniel studied classical sculptures through painting; however, Tenniel was frustrated that he was never taught how to draw. Tenniel would draw the classical statues at the London's Townley Gallery, copied illustrations from books of costumes and armor in the British museum, and drew the animals from the zoo in Regent's Park as well as the actors from the London theatres, which were <b>drawn</b> from the <b>pits.</b> It was in these studies that Tenniel learned to love detail; however, he became impatient with his work and was the happiest when he could draw from memory.

The patients were categorized as follows: 18 (20 %) normal, 31 (34 %) mild dementia, and 42 (46 %) moderate dementia. The copying of the pentagon was part of the MMSE and these drawings were further scrutinized and a 10 -point scoring method developed.

The IPC had some commonality with these measures for patients defined as normal in that most score 10 / 10 for the IPC. However, both mild and moderate dementia patients according to other measures have an overlapping range of scores on the IPC scoring method developed.

Read the 22d verse over again, and {{you will}} find a marvellous {{difference}} between them, as much as is between heaven and hell, everlasting joy and everlasting torments; for you find, that when the beggar died, which represents the godly, he was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom, or into everlasting joy (Psa 1). But the ungodly are not so, but are hurried by the devils into the bottomless <b>pit,</b> <b>drawn</b> away in their wickedness (Prov 14:32), for he saith, 'And in hell he lifted up his eyes.' When the ungodly do die, their misery beginneth, for then appear the devils, like so many lions, waiting every moment till the soul depart from the body. Sometimes they are very visible to the dying party,[11] but sometimes more invisible; but always this is certain, they never miss of the soul if it do die out of the Lord Jesus Christ; but do hale it away to the prison, as I said before, there to be tormented and reserved until that great and general day of judgment, at which day they must, body and soul, receive a final sentence from the righteous Judge, and from that time be shut out from the presence of God into everlasting woe and distress. But the godly, when the time of their departure is at hand, then also are the angels of the Lord at hand; yea, they are ready waiting upon the soul to conduct it safe into Abraham's bosom. I do not say but the devils are ofttimes very busy doubtless, and attending the saints in their sickness: ay, and no question but they would willingly deprive the soul of glory. But here is the comfort, as the devils come from hell to devour the soul, if it be possible, at its departure, so the angels of the Lord come from heaven, to watch over and conduct the soul, in spite of the devil, safe into Abraham's bosom.|$|R

The new OGT line will provide a waste transfer pipeline between these valve pits in support of saltwell pumping activities. The length of the OGT line is approximately 180 ft from pit to pit. The primary pipe is nominal 1 -in. diameter stainless steel (SST) braided Ethylene-propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) hose. The encasement pipe is a nominal 3 -in., flanged, SST pipe made up of several different length pipe spool pieces (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 1 and sh. 2). The OGT line slopes from valve pit 241 -S-B toward valve pit 241 -S-D. At each end, the primary and encasement pipe connect to a pit entry spool piece. The pit entry spool pieces are constructed of prefabricated SST materials. These spool pieces allow for {{the separation of the}} primary and encasement pipelines after the pipes have entered the valve <b>pits</b> (<b>drawing</b> H- 2 - 818280, sh. 2). The pit entry spool pieces also allow for leak detection of the encasement pipe at each end (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 2). The OGT encasement pipeline is supported above ground by adjustable height unistrut brackets and precast concrete bases (drawing H- 2 - 829654, sh. 1). The pipeline is heat-traced and insulated. The heat tracing and insulation supply and retain latent heat that prevents waste solidification during transfers and provides freeze protection.
