25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are relatively insensitive to high and short-term transient voltages higher than surge voltage, if {{the frequency and}} the energy content of the transients are low. This ability depends on rated voltage and component size. Low energy transient voltages lead to a voltage limitation similar to a zener diode. An unambiguous and <b>general</b> <b>specification</b> of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be approved very carefully.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxide forming processes {{take place}} when voltage in correct polarity is applied and generates an additional oxide when transients arise. This formation is accompanied with heat and hydrogen gas generation. This is tolerable if the energy {{content of the}} transient is low. However, when a transient peak voltage causes an electric field strength that is too high for the dielectric, it can directly cause a short circuit. An unambiguous and <b>general</b> <b>specification</b> of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be carefully approved.|$|E

The library and the BMI building were demolished (The BMI moved to premises a block to the east) and the site is now part of the Birmingham Conservatoire and its gardens.
