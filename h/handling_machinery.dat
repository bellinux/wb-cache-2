40|$|An {{increase}} in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca(2 +) is a key component regulating different cellular processes ranging from egg fertilization, active secretion and movement, to cell differentiation and death. The multitude of phenomena modulated by Ca(2 +), however, do not simply rely on increases/decreases in its concentration, but also on specific timing, shape and sub-cellular localization of its signals that, combined together, provide a huge versatility in Ca(2 +) signaling. Intracellular organelles and their Ca(2 +) <b>handling</b> <b>machineries</b> exert key roles in this complex and precise mechanism, and this review will try to depict a map of Ca(2 +) routes inside cells, highlighting {{the uniqueness of the}} different Ca(2 +) toolkit components and the complexity of the interactions between them...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, {{the role of}} calcium stores in {{dendritic}} spines structure, function and plasticity is still debated. The reasons for this {{may have to do}} with the multitude of overlapping calcium <b>handling</b> <b>machineries</b> in the neuron, including stores, voltage and ligand gated channels, pumps and transporters. Also, different cells in the brain are endowed with calcium stores that are activated by different receptor types, and their differential compartmentalization in dendrites, spines and presynaptic terminals complicates their analysis. In the present review we address several key issues, including the role of calcium stores in synaptic plasticity, their role during development, in stress and in neurodegenerative diseases. Apparently, there is increasing evidence for a crucial role of calcium stores, especially of the ryanodine species, in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival...|$|R

25|$|Itoh's company grew {{considerably}} {{in the wake}} of World War I, with offices in the United States, India, the Philippines and China, and the firm began to <b>handle</b> <b>machinery,</b> automobiles and metals in addition to its core business of textiles. However, a recession in 1920 left the company deeply in debt, and unlike the major zaibatsu firms of the time, it had no captive bank to finance its business. In 1921, the company split in half, with one half forming what is now known as Marubeni. The company's performance improved in the 1930s, but as World War II began {{in the latter half of}} the decade, all trading companies' business became increasingly war-oriented. In 1941, Itoh and Marubeni re-combined to form Sanko Kabushiki Kaisha, which merged with two other companies to form Daiken Co., Ltd. in 1944.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{department}} emerged {{with the arrival}} of marine engines for propulsion, largely during the later half of the 19th century.

A United Kingdom subsidiary was developing the group's agricultural and trading interests within the UK.To shore up declining profit margins various decisions were made. Multi-storey wool stores on valuable sites were sold off {{and replaced with}} single storey buildings on city outskirts. The single storey stores allowed the operation of modern more efficient <b>handling</b> <b>machinery</b> but the sale of old stores did not pay for new wool stores and Dalgety raised more capital by issuing debentures to investors in London.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the station's construction, {{the site}} was {{occupied}} by a large grain silo. This followed a standard pattern common to other wartime silos, taking the form of two banks of ten seven-storey high cylindrical reinforced concrete silos {{side by side with}} the space between them filled by a brick access shaft. In the shaft there were associated grain <b>handling</b> <b>machinery</b> and two enormous grain driers which extended the full height of the building. It was built in the early 1940s and closed in the late 1980s, after which the yard surrounding it was used by several local businesses including a pet food supplier and a car breaker.|$|E
40|$|Dendritic spines are microstructures, about 1 femtoliter in volume, where {{excitatory}} synapses {{are made}} with incoming afferents, in most neurons of the vertebrate brain. The spine contains all the molecular constituents of the postsynaptic side of the synapse, {{as well as a}} contractile element that can cause its movement in space. It also contains calcium <b>handling</b> <b>machineries</b> to allow fast buffering of excess calcium that influx through voltage and NMDA gated channels. The spine is connected to the dendrite through a thin neck that serves as a variable barrier between the spine head and the parent dendrite. We present a novel modeling approach that is more suitable for the accurate description of the stochastic behavior of individual molecules in microstructures. Using this approach, we predict the calcium handling ability of the spine in complex situations associated with synaptic activity, spine motility and plasticity. 2 1...|$|R

50|$|After the {{procedure}} the patient will be observed and monitored by a qualified {{individual in the}} endoscopy room or a recovery area until {{a significant portion of}} the medication has worn off. Occasionally the patient is left with a mild sore throat, which may respond to saline gargles, or chamomile tea. It may last for weeks or not happen at all. The patient may have a feeling of distention from the insufflated air that was used during {{the procedure}}. Both problems are mild and fleeting. When fully recovered, the patient will be instructed when to resume their usual diet (probably within a few hours) and will be allowed to be taken home. Where sedation has been used, most facilities mandate that the patient be taken home by another person and that he or she not drive or <b>handle</b> <b>machinery</b> for the remainder of the day. Patients who have had an endoscopy without sedation are able to leave unassisted.|$|R
50|$|Cold ironing does {{away with}} the need to burn fossil fuel on board the ships while they are docked. Under this concept as it is promulgated, ships visiting ports are hooked on to local grid power or other power sources, which are already {{regulated}} by local pollution norms. This externally sourced power serves the ship's internal cargo <b>handling</b> <b>machinery</b> and hotelling requirements. Effectively, all the power generating sources are shut down and ship is hence cold-ironed.This brings immediate relief from pollution by shipboard emissions and allows a more holistic maintenance schedule to be followed by ship operators, which are typically hard put to maintain planned maintenance schedules due to commercial operating pressures. The immediate result is lowered heat outputs from ships, lowered air emissions, lowered risk of accidents from fuel based machinery, lowered disturbance to the ecosystem, among various others.|$|E
5000|$|The {{usefulness}} of the shed and log <b>handling</b> <b>machinery</b> declined in the late 1950s, and White's Shed {{was no longer in}} operation after the bulk sugar terminal was established at Portsmith in 1964. At this new terminal, huge volumes of sugar could be stored and delivered directly into the holds of ships, without needing to be packed into bags or other containers. This new method of sugar handling reduced significantly the wharf labour force for sugar. The sinker log crane {{on the west side of}} the shed was sold in 1959 and was later used at Rankine's Peeramon Mill, near Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tablelands, where it currently resides. The disused White's Shed was subsequently leased to mining companies, perhaps as early as the 1960s. The shed was used to store copper concentrate from the Red Dome mine between 1993 and 1997, and was leased to the Dianne Copper Mine prior to this. The name [...] "White's Shed" [...] derives from this period.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{stevedore}} {{originated in}} Portugal or Spain, {{and entered the}} English language through its use by sailors. It started as a phonetic spelling of estivador (Portuguese) or estibador (Catalan and Spanish), meaning a man who loads ships and stows cargo, which was the original meaning of stevedore (though there is a secondary meaning of [...] "a man who stuffs" [...] in Spanish); compare Latin stīpāre meaning to stuff, as in to fill with stuffing. In the United Kingdom, men who load and unload ships are usually called dockers, in Australia dockers or wharfies, while in the United States and Canada the term longshoreman, derived from man-along-the-shore, is used. Before extensive use of container ships and shore-based <b>handling</b> <b>machinery</b> in the United States, longshoremen referred exclusively to the dockworkers, while stevedores, in a separate trade union, worked on the ships, operating ship's cranes and moving cargo. In Canada, the term stevedore has also been used, for example, {{in the name of}} the Western Stevedoring Company, Ltd., based in Vancouver, B.C., in the 1950s.|$|E
