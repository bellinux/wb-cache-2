40|$|Artículos en revistasThe global {{drive for}} {{integration}} of RESs (renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources)</b> <b>means</b> that TEP (transmission expansion planning) {{has to be}} carried out over geographically wide and large-scale networks under high levels of uncertainty. This leads to complex combinatorial TEP optimization problems, requiring a huge amount of OPF (optimal power flow) computations. The algorithm employed to calculate the OPF must be reasonably accurate but computationally very efficient, because it has to be run for a lot of operational conditions. Overly simplified OPF formulations are not adequate, since they neglect aspects which play a relevant role in TEP. Specifically, network losses significantly influence TEP solutions, but they are often disregarded due to their computational burden. Given their potential impact on the optimal TEP solution, the main focus {{of this paper is to}} find an appropriate losses model in the context of medium to long-term TEP for large-scale power systems. Keeping the balance between accuracy and computation time is essential in such problems. The paper presents two alternative linear losses models, as well as two variants of existing ones. These models are compared and tested using case studies, including small, medium and large-scale networks. Practical conclusions and recommendations are drawn from numerical results. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of ‘sustainable’ energy use: historical {{evidence on the}} relationship between economic growth and renewable energy Roger Fouquet 1. 1 INTRODUCTION Throughout history, energy resources have {{played an important role in}} influencing the rate of economic growth and development. It has been seen as a boost to long-term growth when new <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and technologies were deployed and created abundance (Rosenberg, 1998; Crafts, 2004; Ayres and Warr, 2009). They have also been responsible for slowing down economies in times of perceived scarcity (Nordhaus, 1980). Given the interest in a transition to a low carbon economy, it is appropriate to ask about the role that energy might play in this new context. At present, one can only speculate about the relationship between economic growth and development and low carbon energy resources. A transition to low carbon <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> may provide a boost to the economy. Alternatively, an increasing dependence on renewable energy will imply different levels of resource availability and may create new limits on economic growth. Or, meeting the economy’s energy needs through renewable resources may impose substantially higher costs. Many of the models of long-run energy use have presented a cheap, non-renewable <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> and an expensive renewable <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> as the backstop technology (Nordhaus, 1973; Dasgupta and Heal, 1974; Stiglitz, 1974; Heal, 1976; Chakravorty et al., 1997).

Renewable Energy refers to technologies that has been designed to be eco-friendly and efficient for the well-being of the Earth.

Examples of renewable energy can be seen by wind turbines, solar energy such as solar panels and kinetic energy from waves. These energies are regarded as a technological fix as they have been designed and innovated to overcome issues with energy insecurity, as well as to help protect Earth from the harmful emissions released from non-renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> and thus overcome global warming. It is also know that such technologies will in turn require their own technological fixes.

Such an inverter should be light weight, low cost, efficient, and provide galvanic isolation between the source and the AC output/grid connection. It is also often preferable that the inverter draws constant DC current from the input <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> which <b>means</b> it must smooth out the double-fundamental-frequency energy flow of a single phase AC load connection.

30|$|Electrical {{power supply}} is demand-oriented {{to date and}} not {{flexible}} enough for the challenges described above. In the future, {{it will be necessary}} to change the energy demand according to power generation of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> which <b>means</b> that the regulation will be moved from electricity suppliers to the consumer’s side. Through suitable concepts of demand regulation and distribution, the power grid will be stabilized and optimized [8]. Possible concepts are demand side management and demand response, which are described in [9 – 11]. Demand side management techniques like load shifting and peak clipping are the most known approaches. At load shifting, the load is shifted from a peak period to an off-peak period without changing the total energy consumption of both periods, whereas at peak clipping, the load is reduced by reducing the power consumption [12]. To use these techniques, it is necessary to identify load peaks through analyzing power data from the grid. Based on analysis, an algorithm for shifting load peaks could be developed [13].|$|R

In this study, the energy consumption was analyzed for the air conditioning of an office building in the typical climate of four important cities of the Iberian Peninsula. The energy consumption of one water loop heat pump system was compared with a conventional water system. Two design parameters, the range in the control temperatures and the water loop thermal storage size, were tested. Energy redistribution is an important advantage of the WLHP system, but significant savings came from high efficiency parameters in the heat pumps and minor air flow rates in the cooling tower. The low thermal level in the water loop makes this technology appropriate to combine with renewable sources. Using natural gas as the thermal <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> a <b>mean</b> decrease in CO 2 emissions of 8. 1 % was reached.

An alternative is to convert it to an <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> by <b>means</b> of the Bouduard reaction. In this paper it is examined whether the reaction between RDF and fluegas, supported by the solar energy is attractive from an economic point of view. First of all, the advantage of using RDF in this remediation instead of its use as a raw-material in gasification is examined. The use of RDF in the remediation of the fluegas is advantageous if it is considered the annual production of RDF in agglomerates containing less than 500000 inhabitants. Besides, the effect of the annual production of RDF, carbon tax, manpower and investment cost is examined. The carbon tax increases its importance as much as it increases as the content of CO 2 in the fluegas. The influence of the other parameters is rather independent of the ratio between carbon dioxide and steam in the fluegas while it is more pronounced the variation of the energy cost {{as a function of the}} investment if the plant size is reduced...|$|R

A simple atmospheric radiation transfer model which estimates solar radiation receipt values for optimally tilted and tracking photovoltaic panels was utilized. An angle of 36 ° was determined as optimal for the Lincoln area. Model values were applied to solar panel efficiencies and areas to determine actual received radiation per unit area by the panel. Panels averaged 279 kWh per year when fixed; 336 kWh per year when fitted with tracking equipment. Finally, the estimated panel reception was multiplied by the price of electricity per kWh. Photovoltaic systems are not currently cost effective in Lincoln, NE for commercial use due to low conversion efficiencies of the panels, high installation expenses, and cheap public energy...|$|R

This regulon is {{composed}} of three genes, hbpCA and hbpD, coding for enzymes of a meta-cleavage pathway and the hbpR gene, which codes for a XylR/DmpR-type transcription regulator. It was previously shown that HbpR activates transcription from two σ 54 -dependent promoters, PhbpC and PhbpD, {{in the presence of}} 2 -HBP. In this study, by using gel mobility shift assays with a purified fusion protein containing calmodulin binding protein (CBP) and HbpR, we detected two binding regions for HbpR in PhbpC and one binding region in PhbpD. DNase I footprints of the proximal binding region of PhbpC and of the binding region in PhbpD showed that CBP-HbpR protected a region composed of two inverted repeat sequences which were homologous to the binding sites identified for XylR. Unlike the situation in the XylR/Pu system, we observed simultaneous binding of CBP-HbpR on the two upstream activating sequences (UASs). Fragments with only one UAS did not show an interaction with HbpR, indicating that both pairs of UASs are needed for HbpR binding. The addition of both ATP and 2 -HBP increased the DNA binding affinity of HbpR. These results showed for the first time that, for regulators of the XylR/DmpR type, the effector positively affects the recruitment of the regulatory protein on the enhancer DNA...|$|R

High-intensity focused ul-trasound (HIFU) is becoming an increasingly attractive modality for ablation because of its unique ability for non-invasive or min-imally invasive, non-contact focal ablation in 3 D volume without affecting intervening and surrounding cells. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a real-time monitoring technique to elucidate HIFU-induced modifications of electrical conduction in cardiac tissues and to investigate the HIFU cardiac ablation process to help to achieve optimal HIFU ablation outcome. We conducted experimental studies applying HIFU at 4. 23 MHz to ablate the atrio-ventricular (AV) node and ventricular tissue of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. We employed fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye imaging and surface electrodes to monitor the electrical con-duction activity induced by HIFU application in real time. In ventricular epicardium HIFU ablation, fluorescent imaging re-vealed gradual reduction of the plateau phase and amplitude of the action potential. Subsequently, conduction block and cell death were observed at the site of ablation. When HIFU was applied to the AV node, fluorescent imaging and electrograms revealed the development of the AV block. The study establishes that real-time fluorescent imaging provides novel monitoring and assessment to study HIFU cardiac ablation, which may be able to provide improved understanding of HIFU cardiac ablation pro-cess and mechanism useful for development of successful clinical applications.

It is inevitable that such resources introduce more operational variability and uncertainty to system functioning because of their intermittent nature. As a result, uncertainty management becomes a critical issue in long-term Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) in power systems which feature a significant share of renewable power generation, {{especially in terms of}} computational requirements. A significant part of this uncertainty is often handled by a set of operational states, here referred to as «snapshots». Snapshots are generation-demand patterns that lead to optimal power flow (OPF) patterns in the network. A set of snapshots, each one with an estimated probability, is then used in network expansion optimization. In long-term TEP of large networks, the amount of operational states must be reduced to make the problem computationally tractable. This paper shows how representative snapshots can be selected by means of clustering, without relevant loss of accuracy in a TEP context, when appropriate classification variables are used for the clustering process. The approach relies on two ideas. First, snapshots are characterized by their OPF patterns instead of generation- demand patterns. This is simply because network expansion is the target problem, and losses and congestions are the drivers of network investments. Second, OPF patterns are classified using a «moments» technique, a well-known approach to address Optical Pattern Recognition problems. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the benefits of the proposed clustering methodology. The method seems to be very promising in terms of clustering efficiency and accuracy of the TEP solutions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
