Yet harbor seals have declined by up to 11. 5 %/year from 1992 to 2009. We used satellite-linked transmitters that were attached to 37 female harbor seals to quantify the post-breeding season migrations of seals and the amount of time that seals spent inside vs. outside of the MPA of Glacier Bay. Harbor seals traveled extensively beyond the boundaries of the MPA of Glacier Bay during the post-breeding season, encompassing an area (25, 325 km 2) significantly larger than that used by seals during the breeding season (8, 125 km 2). These movements included the longest migration yet recorded for a harbor seal (3, 411 km) and extended use (up to 23 days) of pelagic areas by some seals. Although the collective utilization distribution of harbor seals during the post-breeding season was quite expansive, there was a substantial degree of individual variability in the percentage of days that seals spent in the MPA. Nevertheless, harbor seals demonstrated a high degree of inter-annual site fidelity (93 %) t...|$|E

40|$|The Environmental Protection Information Center (EPIC) {{presents}} the following comments regarding its petition {{to list the}} Gray Wolf (Canis Lupus) as an “endangered ” species under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA). We appreciate the opportunity to address the Fish and Game Commission (Commission) on this important matter. Summary EPIC urges the Commission to reject the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Department) recommendation to deny listing of the Gray Wolf. There is ample scientific evidence to warrant full listing for the Gray Wolf. The Department’s recommendation fails to satisfy the CESA requirements, which warrant this listing. Instead, the Department’s recommendation {{is based on the}} assumption that “management activities ” will effectively achieve the goal of listing as “endangered ” under CESA. Reliance on “management activities ” to protect the Gray Wolf is insufficient and fraught with peril. The proposed “management activities ” are either voluntary (i. e. creation of a California Wolf Plan), or carry no <b>enforceable</b> <b>protections</b> for the Gray Wolf (i. e. designating the wolf as a special species of concern). These “management activities ” as identified by the Department are not sufficient to ensure that the Gray Wolf, in serious danger of being extinct in California, is actually “conserved ” in California as provided by CESA. We therefore urge the Commission to list the Gray Wolf as an “endangered ” species and provide it the fullest protections of the law in California. ...|$|R

40|$|Investment {{treaties}} are triangular treaties. Investment treaties are {{entered into}} by two states {{but they are}} unusual because they provide <b>enforceable</b> <b>protections</b> to investors as third party beneficiaries. State A (the host state) agrees to provide certain protections to investors coming from State B (the home state). If the investor considers that these protections have been violated, investment treaties also grant the investor permission to bring an arbitral claim directly against the host state. Investment treaties clearly protect investors against certain unilateral actions by host states, such as expropriation without compensation. But do they also protect investors against unilateral actions by home states and collective actions by the treaty parties? For instance: can a home state settle an investor’s claim without the investor’s consent; can a host state rely on inter-state countermeasures as a defense in an investor-state dispute; and can the treaty parties jointly terminate the treaty with immediate effect? Investment treaties tend not to answer these questions, yet these second and third order questions are beginning to plague the field. These issues are important because they strike {{at the heart of}} the investment treaty system, requiring us to confront fundamental and unanswered questions about the nature and limits of investment treaty rights. In particular, what rights have been given to investors? And what powers have been retained by home and host states acting individually and the treaty parties acting collectively? Instead of following the existing path of analyzing whether investment treaties create procedural and/or substantive rights, I contend that investment treaties should be reconceptualized as agreements between sovereign states that create enforceable benefits for investors as non-sovereign, third party beneficiaries. This triangular approach produces a hybrid theory that draws on principles from public international law, domestic contract law, and public law, which can be used to create appropriate default rules for resolving the three controversies listed above...|$|R

Boyd’s book entitled, The Environmental Rights Revolution: A Global Study of Constitutions, Human Rights, and the Environment, {{provides}} a comprehensive overview of {{nations that have}} incorporated {{the right to a}} healthy environment in their constitutions. Throughout his research, Boyd analyzes the effectiveness of environmental protection provisions in national constitutions and seeks to determine whether constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to a healthy environment have measurable, positive effects on the environment. His wide-ranging compilation and analysis of environmental rights provisions in numerous countries is an important contribution to international human rights literature. Although Boyd explains that treating the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental human right is not a new idea, his broad research demonstrates that many national constitutions have, in fact, adopted <b>enforceable</b> environmental <b>protection</b> provisions, particularly the right to a healthy environment. Boyd’s research provides concrete examples of how the constitutional right to a healthy environment, and national legislation guaranteeing that right, have had positive environmental consequences. He predicts that in the future these rights will continue to help combat the effects of global climate change and environmental degradation that permeate national borders to enable the world to achieve the goal of sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate about {{bilateral}} investment treaties (BITs) – and investor-state arbitration, in particular – between those who maintain that BITs encourage investment in developing countries by providing <b>enforceable</b> rights and <b>protections</b> for investors, and those who suspect that these new rights and protections have {{a chilling effect on}} regulation for public and environmental welfare and actually hinder development. For years, both ―camps ‖ have drawn heavily upon anecdotal evidence and observations to support their view, as no systematic, comprehensive study of empirical data on investment arbitrations had been undertaken. To fill this void, legal scholar Susan Franck has evaluated the criticisms of investment arbitration based on empirical studies of published or known disputes (Franck 2009; Franck 2007). These efforts produced helpful data and initiated a productive discussion of these issues. However, the results and conclusions that can be drawn from Franck’s work are more limited and warrant more nuance than Franck and others so far have taken into account.

40|$|The {{outcome of}} joining the WTO and {{implementing}} TRIPS agreement has caused a never-ending dispute {{in terms of both}} positive and negative perspectives. Patient's access to essential medicines and sustainability of the domestic pharmaceutical industry are two important relevant topics in the developing countries. Two major consequences are trade liberalisation and enforcing an international intellectual property rights. The immediate impact will be free flow of medicines from the developed countries in the case of innovative drugs and more recently from India and China for cheap commodity medicines that are supported by the internationally <b>enforceable</b> intellectual property <b>protections.</b> The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry in Iran post WTO agreement using the readiness index. In the absence of previously developed instruments, two study tools were developed and validated {{in the course of this}} study namely WTO pharmaceutical Industry (PI) Impact Rating Scale and Pharmaceutical Industry Transition Instrument (PITI). Using the Delphi technique, an expert panel consisting of academics, industry senior managers and regulators identified 29 parameters that the study should focus on generating consensus for the industry in preparation {{of joining the}} WTO. The top 6 parameters included importation tariff, management knowledge, training, R&D, customer satisfaction and patent review. The study was then carried out throughout the industry to evaluate the current situation and future importance of the identified parameters that were restructured in 66 statements of the PITI. The outcomes of the studies reported in this thesis suggest that with the current situation in the pharmaceutical industry in Iran, it is unlikely that the industry will be able to cope with the post-WTO challenges to deliver the growth needed to underpin its long term sustainability. The compliance of the industry with the requirements of the WTO at the current situation was concluded to be "unsatisfactory" for the majority of the PITI statements using binomial test (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|The 115 th Congress faces {{policy issues}} related to the Trump Administration’s renegotiation and {{modernization}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA negotiations were first launched in 1992 under President H. W. Bush, who signed the agreement in December 1992, and continued under President Bill Clinton, who negotiated additional side agreements on labor and the environment. President Clinton signed the agreement into law on December 8 1993, (P. L. 103 - 182) and NAFTA entered into force on January 1, 1994. It is particularly significant because it was the most comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) negotiated at the time, contained several groundbreaking provisions, and was the first {{of a new generation of}} U. S. FTAs later negotiated. Congress played a major role during its consideration and, after contentious and comprehensive debate, ultimately approved legislation to implement the agreement. NAFTA established trade liberalization commitments that set new rules and disciplines for future FTAs on issues important to the United States, including intellectual property rights protection, services trade, dispute settlement procedures, investment, labor, and the environment. NAFTA’s market-opening provisions gradually eliminated nearly all tariff and most nontariff barriers on goods produced and traded within North America. At the time of NAFTA, average applied U. S. duties on imports from Mexico were 2. 07 %, while U. S. businesses faced average tariffs of 10 %, in addition to nontariff and investment barriers, in Mexico. The U. S. -Canada FTA had been in effect since 1989. Trade among NAFTA partners has tripled since the agreement entered into force, forming a more integrated North American market. The Trump Administration has made NAFTA renegotiation and modernization a prominent initial priority of its trade policy. President Trump has viewed the agreement as the “worst trade deal,” and has stated that he may seek to withdraw from the agreement. He has focused on the trade deficit with Mexico as a major reason for his critique. On May 18, 2017, the Trump Administration sent a 90 -day notification to Congress of its intent to begin talks to renegotiate NAFTA, as required by the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) (P. L. 114 - 26). Negotiations started August 16, 2017. Stating they are committed to an expeditious process, negotiators plan to have a series of seven rounds at three-week intervals for a conclusion by the end of 2017 or early 2018. The fourth round of negotiations began at the time this report was printed. The final text of the agreement will not be released until after negotiations are concluded. NAFTA parties have agreed that the information exchanged in the context of the negotiations, such as the negotiating text, proposals of each government, and other materials related to the substance of the negotiations, must remain confidential. Congress will likely continue to be a major participant in shaping and potentially considering an updated NAFTA. Key issues for Congress in regard to the renegotiation or modernization include the constitutional authority of Congress over international trade, its role in revising or withdrawing from the agreement, the U. S. negotiating objectives, the impact on U. S. industries and the U. S. economy, the negotiating objectives of Canada and Mexico, and the impact on broader relations with Canada and Mexico. The outcome of these negotiations will have implications for the future direction of U. S. trade policy under President Trump. NAFTA renegotiation may provide opportunities to address issues not covered in the original text. Technology and industrial production processes have changed significantly since it was negotiated. The widespread use of the Internet has affected economic activities and the use of e-commerce, for example. A modernization could incorporate elements of more recent U. S. FTAs, such as digital and services trade and enhanced IPR protection. Many U. S. manufacturers, services providers, and agricultural producers oppose efforts to eliminate NAFTA and ask that the Trump Administration strive to “do no harm” in the negotiations because they have much to lose if the United States pulls out of the agreement. Other groups contend that NAFTA should be rewritten to include stronger and more <b>enforceable</b> labor <b>protections,</b> provisions on currency manipulation, and stricter rules of origin...|$|R
30|$|At {{the heart}} of triple helix {{innovation}} lies the realisation that intra-helical knowledge is an inter-helical innovation asset. As with every other asset, the valorisation of intra-helical knowledge through inter-helical triple helix research productivity ultimately requires commodification. The commercial value of a commodity depends entirely on its marketability which, in turn, entirely depends on its transferability—either in toto or as regards its innate utilisation and consumption entitlements. Transferability is impossible without the legal (hence, <b>enforceable)</b> recognition and <b>protection</b> of ownership, control and disposition rights that make the commodity a commodity {{in the first place}} (Todeva 2005, 2013). In other words, both marketable property rights in knowledge assets and the legal (and, often, exclusive) ownership, control, utilisation and disposition rights vested in a property holder (i.e. asset owner) need to be institutionally recognised and protected by law ex ante of any (ability of) valorisation. If the organisational and institutional design (of triple helix intermediation) indeed matters for purposes of the performance, growth and sustainability of firms, ‘quasi-firms’ (Etzkowitz 2003 b) and other (quasi-)entrepreneurial ventures (including real-world triple helix projects) (Fitjar et al. 2014; Garrett-Jones et al. 2013; Klerkx and Leeuwis 2008; Roberts 2004), then law, in particular, the legal organisational setup and control of such firms and other ventures, constitutes a crucial, indeed, foundational ingredient of their overall institutional governance and efficiency equilibria (La Porta et al. 2000; Maughan and McGuinness 2001). Law and its organisational tools institute both the individual enabling structures and the global infrastructure for innovation and entrepreneurship to occur and to create economic value. Law and legal organisation also decide to whom the economic benefits of innovation and entrepreneurship activity will accrue. The creation and distribution of social welfare gains qua law, thus, also drive innovation and entrepreneurship intermediation. Here, the productive focus may be more on the provision of value-added innovation services (Wright et al. 2008 : 1206) rather than on the development of innovative goods or technologies. Still, for intermediation (and intermediary knowledge and services) to constitute an innovation asset—thus, for a market for intermediation services to exist in the first place—the law has to similarly recognise such services as a valuable commodity, has to support their marketability in predictable and enforceable contractual buy-sell or licensing transactions and has to ultimately decide to whom the economic gains of intermediation activity will accrue—both, direct gains (i.e. financial income) and indirect gains (i.e. new innovation assets created through intermediated team productivity). To paraphrase Tuunainen (2005 b: 285), the triple helix and its intermediation may ‘be conceptualized in terms of historically-evolving local activities where researchers [, firms and government agencies] make use of heterogeneous sets of cultural resources [including legal resources] to achieve their particular objectives.’ Given that a particular society’s provision of legal resources is neither accidental nor ad hoc—in other words, that such provision has to be planned, organised, structured and specifically legislated ex ante—there are two possible avenues for the legal support and organisation of triple helix intermediation: either a given legal jurisdiction can adapt existing legal property and governance structures to accommodate and recognise triple helix innovation assets (as well as their ownership and control), or the same jurisdiction can adopt new, sui-generis property and governance structures by legislative action in order to properly domicile and organise such assets as public goods.|$|R
