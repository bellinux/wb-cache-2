5000|$|Circus Maximus was {{composed}} {{at the behest}} of the conductor Jerry Junkin, Director of Bands at the University of Texas at Austin. Junkin had originally approached Corigliano about composing a wind ensemble piece years before, but the composer turned the offer down, later remarking, [...] "the thought of that enormous ensemble, composed of so many instruments I had never written for, overwhelmed me." [...] Junkin persisted, however, and Corigliano eventually agreed to compose the work. Corigliano wrote in the score program notes, [...] "Jerry wanted a large and theatrical piece: a third symphony. And, when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> it made a certain sense. My first symphony was for large symphony orchestra, my second for string orchestra alone, and this piece is for winds, brass and percussion alone." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album's sleeve was {{designed}} and illustrated by English artist Roger Dean, who would design many of Yes's future album covers, including their [...] "bubble" [...] logo. On reflection of the design, Dean said: [...] "'Fragile' was very literal, really. I think the band has named a number of their albums after their current psychological state, and 'Fragile' described the psyche of the band. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> very literally, painting a fragile world that would eventually break up." [...] He commented further: [...] "'Fragile' was quite a complicated cover {{because there was a}} book inside. It was elaborate although it wasn't {{one of the most striking}} of all the Yes covers. I was kind of learning my trade at the time. The main feature on the cover was a little Bonsai world with a wooden space ship flying overhead! It was literally meant to be a fragile world".|$|E

However, he later {{announced that}} the album would be released on December 18, 2007, until it was pushed back to February 19, 2008. In November 2007, {{in an interview with}} HipHopDX, Rick Ross spoke about who would be featured on the album, saying: [...] "Most definitely. I wanted to step everything up. Thats why I reached out to R. Kelly for the first single. I got Marsha Ambrosious from Floetry to come in and help get the females on my team. She did a lot of work with Michael Jackson. When I was working with her, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> We laughed, we chopped it up, we just had fun. We put together some real big records. This album is going to be much better than Port of Miami and possibly the best album of the year." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Edge of Glory" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow, and was {{produced}} by Gaga and Garibay. The origins of the song first came about in January 2011, when Gaga released part of the lyrics on her Twitter account. White Shadow revealed that before they returned to Europe for the 2010 dates of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga had taken leave for few days {{to be with her}} ailing grandfather. After he died, Gaga told White Shadow that she wrote a song about her grandfather's death and its impact on her. Gaga spoke to Jon Pareles of The New York Times about the story behind the song:"Edge of Glory' was about how when my grandma was standing over my grandfather while he was dying.

I'm left with my experience of our relationship, my feelings about the emotional intensity of our interactions. Sometimes when I'm with her I feel big, sometimes small, sometimes far away, fragmented, happy or angry. How do we influence each other's identities? When is an identity finished?

There are many North American authors who were not referenced, and could have been. Yet I don’t {{know that this is}} to the book’s great detri-ment; and I wonder, moreover, if American authors have paid as much atten-tion to Australian and UK writers as Crisp has to her American counterparts. But it likewise makes me question if spirituality and social work isn’t too immersed in regional and national silos. A generation ago, one of my country’s leading fiction writers published a book on the cleavages between English and French communities in Canada, appropriately called Two Solitudes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> title, reading Crisp’s excellent book.

40|$|Abstract only availableIn {{alpine tundra}} plants, {{water is the}} most {{important}} environmental factor of plant growth. And the endomycorrhiza is the greatest symbiotic organism. Because, it provides Nitrogen and Phosphorus to the plants and it obtains the a Carbohydrate from the plants. Based on the experimental result, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> if the plants had reached the limit, would they effect to the mycorrhiza? For that question, I made a experiment plan. Through controling of water volume, I could get the data of P. delicatum (called Jacob's ladder) about the morphological growths and the increment of the endomycorrhizas for 3 weeks. To control the environment, I built a weather port which can avoid rain, in addition opened the side of the weather port to make sure other variations as equal. After that, I made 4 treatments, which 10 plants have randomly assigned. And using ANOVA-test, I got 0. 8615 as probablity. It means they are randomly assigned well. Each treatment has different water volume from 50 ml every day to none of water. And then, I collected pre-data and post-data of morphological feature and number of endomycorrhizas. Unfortunately, I can't make a conclusion now. Because, I finished counting og the endomycorrhizas yesterday. So I need time to apply statistical approachs to my data. But I presuppose the result as the more watered plants would be had more endomycorrhizas...|$|E
40|$|When I {{was asked}} to prepare this lecture, it was {{suggested}} that I should talk about the presentation of data. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> for some time, and I asked myself, &dquo;What is data anyway?&dquo; There is no real problem in listing raw data; you need merely record it accurately in a readable fashion employing some understandable system. But {{that had nothing to do}} with thepresentation of data. You only present data after you have ar-ranged it, analyzed it, studied it, and made some sense out of it. And why do you present it at all? Clearly you present the data in order to convince someone that your analysis, and the conclusions drawn from that analysis, are sound. What kind of data do you present in order to do this persuading? A great variety of kinds. Graphs are a form of data; so are maps; so are photographs, circuit diagrams, tables, questionnaire forms. Is there any way of de-scribing how best to present these? There is, I think, if you consider them all as forms of evidence. Once you conceive of them this way, you can begin to see what evidence, or data, to present, and how to present it. Now the minute you use the word &dquo;evidence,&dquo; most lawyers will think of &dquo;Wigmore. &dquo; No one who has read a legal tome can avoid the name John Hen-ry Wigmore, Dean Emeritus of the Law School of Northwestern University. Dean Wigmore’s numer-ous books on evidence are cited again and again in legal briefs. I am going to rely heavily on Dean Wig-more’s The Science of Judicial Proof in talking about evidence. Lest this seem rather remote from the problems of scientific and technical writing, let me add some ideas of Percy Bridgman from his boo...|$|E
