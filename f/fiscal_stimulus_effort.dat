For instance, if a <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> employs a worker who {{otherwise would have been}} unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation.|$|R

40|$|The Great Recession in 2008 has {{provided}} the researcher {{with an opportunity to}} study the effectiveness of fiscal policy in high debt and low debt countries in the pre-recession and post-recession period. The research was centred around the effect of national debt level on the effectiveness of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> which has become increasingly crucial in the current economic condition as increasing number of countries has fallen into the high debt category. In order to investigate the impact of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> in different national debt level countries, the researcher has utilised hierarchical multiple linear regression model. In this study, the researcher has performed preliminary statistical analysis of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus,</b> investigation of the behaviour of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and investment slope coefficient before performing the hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis. Result for hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis on high and low debt countries suggested that the effect of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> in low debt countries were larger than the effect of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> in high debt countries. This research is important because better understanding of the impact of national debt on fiscal policy could add to the current literature bodies on the researched topic.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{patterns}} of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimuli</b> in the OECD countries propagated by the global crisis. Overall, {{we find that the}} USA net <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> was modest relative to peers, despite it being the epicenter of the crisis, and having access to relatively cheap funding of its twin deficits. The USA is ranked at the bottom third in terms of the rate of expansion of the consolidated government consumption and investment of the 28 countries in sample. Contrary to historical experience, emerging markets had strongly countercyclical policy during the period immediately preceding the Great Recession and the Great Recession. Many developed OECD countries had procyclical fiscal policy stance in the same periods. Federal unions, emerging markets and countries with very high GDP growth during the pre-recession period saw larger net <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> on average than their counterparts. We also find that greater net <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> was associated with lower flow costs of general government debt in the same or subsequent period. ...|$|R

Following this reduction, the Bank of Japan expanded the money stock {{by an average}} of 10.5 percent per year from 1986 until 1990. Between 1992 and 1995, Japan tried six spending programs totaling 65.5 trillion yen and cut income tax rates during 1994. In January 1998, Japan temporarily cut taxes again by 2 trillion yen. Then, in April of that year, the government unveiled a <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> package worth more than 16.7 trillion yen, almost half of which was for public works. Again, in November 1998, another <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> package worth 23.9 trillion yen was announced. A year later (November 1999), yet another <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> package of 18 trillion yen was tried. Finally, in October 2000, Japan announced yet another <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> package of 11 trillion yen. Overall during the 1990s, Japan tried 10 <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> packages totaling more than 100 trillion yen, and each failed to cure the recession.

We investigate if a <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> can be enhanced (or harmed) by particular exit strategies. The impact multipliers proved insufficient to discriminate between alternative strategies. However, since the policy impacts are not limited to the short run, there are relevant effects over the medium run {{that can be used to}} evaluate the different strategies. It will be claimed that (i) the announcement of a promptly and timely exit strategy, contemporaneous to the announcement of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus,</b> with a consolidation period that is not prolonged indefinitively, may improve the effectiveness of the stimulus and that (ii) exit strategies based on Government consumption cuts tend to dominate over other alternatives, such as transfers cuts or tax rate increases. ...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{discussion}} about <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> focuses on the multiplier of government spending on impact. In this paper we shift the focus to the multiplier at the end, i. e. to {{the period in which}} a deficit spending program terminates. We show that recent time series analyses as well as economic models of different schools of thought predict that the multiplier turns negative before spending expires. This means that aggregate output at the time of expiry of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> is predicted to be lower than it could be without deficit spending. We set up a simple model that explains this phenomenon. Using phase diagram analysis we prove that the aggregate capital stock at the time of expiry of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> is lower than it would be without the deficit spending program. This fact explains why aggregate output is below its laissez faire level as well.

40|$|In 2009 / 10 governments {{around the}} world {{implemented}} unprecedented <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> in order to counter {{the impact of the}} Global Financial Crisis of 2008 / 09. This paper analyzes the impact of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> using a dynamic open economy, overlapping generations model that allows for feedback effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> on private sector expenditure via changes in the tax rate and the interest rate. There are two types of goods-traded (T) and nontraded (N) goods-which differ in their capital intensities. The main qualitative result is that the dynamic output gains from <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> depend on the productivity of the initial stimulus spending, on the speed of repayment of debt, on the sensitivities of the interest rate to government debt and of labor supply to the tax rate. Also, the overlapping generations framework allows an intergenerational welfare analysis. Among the biggest winners from stimulus are those about to retire. The biggest losers are those near the start of their working lives when the stimulus is implemented. Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsNo Full Tex...|$|R

Sound economic fundamentals and timely and forceful policy {{responses to the}} crisis, including <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus,</b> contributed to rapid economic recovery in the ASEAN- 5. As growth rebounds, these economies are beginning to identify, communicate and implement their strategies for unwinding the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stimulus</b> while addressing long-term growth challenges. In this context, the paper highlights the need for fiscal policies to address infrastructure gaps, stimulate private consumption and expand social safety nets. Creating fiscal space to address these challenges will require raising revenues and reorienting public spending rather than increasing borrowing. Supporting structural reforms, aiming to stimulate private infrastructure investment, could help address long-term growth challenges, while easing the burden on fiscal policy.
