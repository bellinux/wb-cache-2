The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated.

Methods This was conducted by investigating 2 MEBM's in vitro influence on cell cycle progression, mitochondrial membrane potential and possible production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In vitro effects of 2 MEBM on cell cycle progression was demonstrated by means of flow cytometry using propidium <b>iodide.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> peroxide and superoxide production was investigated using 2, 7 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate and hydroethidine, respectively. The probable reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential was demonstrated using a MitoCapture™ kit. Results Cell cycle progression revealed the presence of a sub-G 1 apoptotic peak. Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential after exposure to 2 MEBM was demonstrated and an increase in ROS production was also observed. Conclusion This study verified that 2 MEBM exposure resulted in apoptosis induction, increased ROS production and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in a tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line.

The reaction of <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide with <b>iodide</b> catalyzed by molybdate was chosen as a model system with conditions adjusted to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. Effects of changes of pH as well as concentrations of iodide and molybdate were evaluated using four different data-processing options.

The new options are 10 - to 70 -fold less dependent on changes for variables studied. ^ Part II of the thesis describes a study designed to extend a data-processing approach developed for chemical reactions to physico-chemical processes. Atomic absorption spectroscopy with electrothermal atomization was chosen as a model system. Five metal ion solutions were tested. Effects of atomization temperature were evaluated using three options. All data-processing options yield linear calibration plots and the deconvolution option is 7 - to 72 -fold, and 1 - to 18 -fold less dependent on temperature than the conventional peak-height and peak-area options, respectively. ^ Part III describes a study to evaluate {{a new approach to}} the resolution of overlapped chromatographic peaks. Experimental data of acetic and formic acids were used to synthesize overlapped peak area vs. time data and asymmetrical sigmoid functions were fit to these data to resolve their individual components.
