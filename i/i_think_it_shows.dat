[...] Seven months earlier, on September 7, 2011, in a message on Twitter, the 70-year-old Diamond {{announced}} his engagement to the 41-year-old McNeil. Diamond said that his 2014 album Melody Road was fueled by his relationship with McNeil, explaining: [...] "There's no better inspiration or motivation for work than being in love. It's what you dream of as a creative person. I was able to complete this album – start it, write it and complete it – {{under the spell of}} love, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> somehow."

[Still seated L.C.] Oh, {{nowadays}} so many conceited {{people go}} about Society {{pretending to be}} good, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> rather a sweet and modest disposition {{to pretend to be}} bad. Besides, there is this to be said. If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously. If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.|$|E

That’s what the Obama campaign, to their credit, said all along. We <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> just over 73 percent. Also, youth turnout higher and senior turnout lower than expected. That’s {{a pretty big}} deal given {{the size of the}} generation gap. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> clearly that the Obama team had a great game plan for identifying their vote and getting it to the polls." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vallée {{himself was}} {{not a fan of}} the film. In a 1980 TV interview, he mused, [...] "They're still fumigating the theaters where <b>it</b> was <b>shown.</b> Almost ruined me.

"Your pardon Mr. Howel; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows,</b> {{according}} to your own admission, that his wit, or rather its wit, for there is no his about it--that its wit is of a very indifferent quality as witticisms even; that it is ignorant of what it pretends to know; and that its opinions are no better than its knowledge: all of which, when fairly established against one who, by his very pursuit, professes to know more than other people, {{is very much like}} making it appear contemptible." ...|$|E

"I like dancing, I {{can assure}} you, {{where there is}} room to dance; but I don't call it dancing {{when you have an}} area of only a foot square to dance in, and are hustled and bumped more than you would be in a crowded Lord Mayor's show. My {{training}} has not suited me for it, and I would rather stand and look on, listen to scraps of conversation, watch the faces of the dancers and of those standing round. It is a study, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> one of the worst sides of nature. It is quite shocking to see and hear the envy, uncharitableness, the boredom, and the desperate efforts to look cheerful under difficulties, especially among the girls that do not get partners." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{every now}} and then, and indeed {{surprisingly}} often, Christ finds a word that transcends all common-place morality; {{every now and}} then he quits the beaten track to pioneer the unexpressed, and throws out a pregnant and magnanimous hyperbole; for it is only by some bold poetry of thought that men can be strung up above the level of everyday conceptions to take a broader look upon experience or accept some higher principle of conduct. To a man who is of the same mind that was in Christ, who stands at some centre not too far from his, and looks at the world and conduct from some not dissimilar or, at least, not opposing attitude—or, shortly, to a man who is of Christ’s philosophy—every such saying should come home with a thrill of joy and corroboration; he should feel each one below his feet as another sure foundation in the flux of time and chance; each should be another proof that in the torrent of the years and generations, where doctrines and great armaments and empires are swept away and swallowed, he stands immovable, holding by the eternal stars. But alas! at this juncture of the ages it is not so with us; on each and every such occasion our whole fellowship of Christians falls back in disapproving wonder and implicitly denies the saying. Christians! the farce is impudently broad. Let us stand up in the sight of heaven and confess. The ethics that we hold are those of Benjamin Franklin. Honesty is the best policy, is perhaps a hard saying; it is certainly one by which a wise man of these days will not too curiously direct his steps; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a glimmer of meaning to even our most dimmed intelligences; I think we perceive a principle behind it; I think, without hyperbole, we are of the same mind that was in Benjamin Franklin.|$|E

[...] On the same programme, the Time Out television critic Alkarim Jivani said [...] "... I feel that the great thing about this documentary, if there is one distinguishing factor of good documentaries, it makes us feel that there's less that divides from each other than joins us." ...|$|R

Once knowing that, thoroughly, we can further learn from the swallow what a wing is; from the chough what a beak is; and from the falcon what a claw is.|$|R
5000|$|According to drummer Paul Ferguson, [...] "Eighties", {{like other}} music by Killing Joke, was [...] "aggressive music.

The single was co-written with his {{frequent}} collaborator Josh Kear, and as noted by interviewer Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall sound of the song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "It's a completely different type of song for Carrie.

Our Morricone-influence has always been there, but on [...] "Miranda" [...] we let it all out.

[...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie.

[...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning with Flash Comics #4 (April 1940), Moldoff {{became the}} regular Hawkman artist, {{following}} Neville's {{departure from the}} feature the issue before.

But when I looked at 'Hawkman' and read a couple of stories, I said to myself, 'This has to be done in aRaymond style.' I could just feel it.... I had saved Flash Gordon Sunday strip pages and the daily papers for years! ... Gaines liked my style; he liked the realism. We were competing with the newspapers. When he picked up the Sunday papers, he saw Flash Gordon, Prince Valiant, Terry and the Pirates. When he picked up a comic book, there was a tremendous difference in the quality of the art. And then, all of a sudden, he saw me—an 18-year-old coming around, and I'm almost a student of Raymond, and by God, the stuff looks good—it looks like Raymond! We all leaned on these guys to learn—and we were very lucky, because while we were learning, we were selling the product... I {{spent a lot of time}} on it.

5000|$|Westlife was {{recently}} asked by Daily Star about {{the success of}} the song for the band. Egan stated: [...] "It is amazing that after 11 albums we can still do things we haven't done before, or set new records for ourselves. What About Now definitely changed things. It might not have sold millions of copies, but I was on YouTube yesterday and the video has almost two million plays or something.

50|$|We didn't {{want the}} Christmas album to be melancholy, but we didn't {{want it to}} be all {{traditional}} either. It's Americana. I was a pop artist when I first started. I didn't cross over to country until my second album. That's why I think this album has a diverse feel to it. It's very eclectic. I love this Christmas record. It's cool for me. This is something I never could have done on a record label. Christmas albums aren't platinum or even gold sellers. Well, maybe after a while they are. But they don't debut at No. 1.

They beat the No. 11 team from Joe Gibbs Racing, driven on track by Denny Hamlin, by 0.294 seconds. Following the challenge, Johnson stated, [...] "In this discipline, the athleticism and training really pays off. We made a big effort to get full-fledged athletes who did nothing but work on their pit stops and disciplines.

60|$|About {{twenty years}} ago I had much {{correspondence}} and discussion with Mr. Darwin on this question. I then believed that I was able to demonstrate the action of natural selection in accumulating infertility; but I could not convince him, owing to the extreme complexity of the process under the conditions which he thought most probable. I have recently returned to the question; and, with the fuller knowledge of the facts of variation we now possess, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> may be <b>shown</b> that natural selection is, in some probable cases at all events, able to accumulate variations in infertility between incipient species.|$|R

In the City of Boston, as I have said, I found that in 1857 about one-eighth of the whole population were then on the books of the free public schools as pupils, and that about one- ninth of the population formed the average daily attendance. To these numbers of course must be added all pupils of the richer classes--those for whose education their parents chose to pay. As nearly as I can learn, the average duration of each pupil's schooling is six years, and if this be figured out statistically, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will <b>show</b> that education in Boston reaches a very large majority--I might almost say the whole--of the population.
