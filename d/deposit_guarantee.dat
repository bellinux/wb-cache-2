5|$|On 30 November the Troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank) and the Cypriot Government {{had agreed}} on the bailout terms with only {{the amount of money}} {{required}} for the bailout remaining to be agreed upon. Bailout terms include strong austerity measures, including cuts in civil service salaries, social benefits, allowances and pensions and increases in VAT, tobacco, alcohol and fuel taxes, taxes on lottery winnings, property, and higher public health care charges. At the insistence of the EU negotiators, at first the proposal also included an unprecedented one-off levy of 6.7% for deposits up to €100.000 and 9.9% for higher deposits on all domestic bank accounts. Following public outcry, the eurozone finance ministers were forced to change the levy, excluding deposits of less than €100,000, and introducing a higher 15.6% levy on deposits of above €100,000 ($129,600)—in line with the EU minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantee.</b> This revised deal was also rejected by the Cypriot parliament on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote.|$|E
25|$|After this announcement, the rupiah {{immediately}} gained almost 10%, {{to around}} 3,300 rupiah per dollar. Soon after, however, confidence began to fall. The IMF response {{had only been}} published in summary form {{from the government and}} Bank of Indonesia, the choice of the sixteen banks being closed appeared arbitrary, and the details of the 34 others subject to special measures were not announced. The <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantee</b> was seen as inadequate, and funds were moved from private to state banks, exchanged for dollars, or transferred offshore, as confidence in the plan began to evaporate.|$|E
25|$|Uncertainty {{began to}} {{dominate}} the global financial and economic environment. Business and consumer confidence in New Zealand plummeted as dozens of finance companies collapsed. To try and stop a flight of funds from New Zealand institutions to those in Australia, the Government established the Crown Retail <b>Deposit</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Scheme to cover depositors funds {{in the event that}} a bank or finance company went broke. This protected some investors but nevertheless, at least 67 finance companies collapsed within a short period of time. The largest of these was South Canterbury Finance which cost taxpayers NZ$1.58 billion when the company collapsed in August 2010. The directors of many of these finance companies were subsequently investigated for fraud and some high-profile directors went to prison.|$|E

It was rumoured that Iceland would refuse the loan offered by the UK and Netherlands, as those two loans were only earmarked for the repayment of minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantees</b> to the Icesave bank, which was a foreign branch of the now bankrupt Landsbanki, and thus Iceland felt {{it was not the}} Icelandic states responsibility to guarantee/pay for the payment of such minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantees</b> to the British and Dutch savers, and apparently instead preferred to leave them unpaid while referring them to legal proceedings over the alleged failure of British and Dutch watchdogs for the financial services sector.|$|R

On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantee</b> imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National <b>Deposit</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Institution.|$|E

50|$|As the {{bankruptcy}} of Landsbanki was one of 3 big systemically important financial institutions going bankrupt {{within a few days}} in Iceland, the Tryggingarsjóður however had already been drained from capital reserves, and had no money left to repay the legally required €4.0bn of minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantees</b> to the 343,306 foreign retail customers from United Kingdom and Netherlands, who had lost all their €6.7bn of deposits in the Icesave branch of Landsbanki. Because nothing was expected immediately to be repaid by any Icelandic institutions/authorities, both the Dutch and British state decided to step in and cover all these account losses in full; while however at the same time demanding the Icelandic state should sign a loan guarantee agreement concerning repayment of the €4.0bn of Icelandic minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantees</b> plus accrued interests. Subsequently the terms for these loan guarantee agreements were negotiated between the states in the so-called Icesave bills, where Iceland to meet its obligations was offered a £2.35bn (€2.7bn) loan by UK and a €1.3bn loan by the Netherlands. Repayment of the €4.0bn of minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantees,</b> was supposed to happen partly/entirely through the liquidation of remaining positive assets by the Landsbanki receivership in 2009-2015, with the Icelandic state only to overtake/guarantee for the potential remaining repayments in 2016.|$|R

Thus it was only the Icelandic authorities having a legal responsibility in the case, and this fact alone emphasized the need for a solution about the payment of minimum <b>deposit</b> <b>guarantees</b> to the Dutch and British Icesave account holders, either to be reached with the Icelandic state or the Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the recent credit slowdown among Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries from three analytical angles. First, it finds that, {{similar to other}} regions and to its past history, a credit boom preceded the current slowdown, and that a protracted period of sluggish growth is likely going forward. Second, it uncovers a key role played by bank funding (deposit growth and external borrowing slowed considerably) but whose effect was frequently dampened by expansionary monetary policy. Third, bank-level fundamentals - capitalization and loan quality - helped to explain differences in credit growth across banks and countries.
