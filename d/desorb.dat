25|$|Woodworking: when wood {{is used as}} a {{construction}} material, whether as a structural support in a building or in woodworking objects, it will absorb or <b>desorb</b> moisture until it is in equilibrium with its surroundings. Equilibration (usually drying) causes unequal shrinkage in the wood, and can cause damage to the wood if equilibration occurs too rapidly. The equilibration must be controlled to prevent damage to the wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or <b>desorb</b> the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|In other instances, {{molecular}} {{interactions between}} gas molecules previously adsorbed on a solid surface form significant interactions with gas molecules in the gaseous phases. Hence, adsorption of gas molecules {{to the surface}} {{is more likely to}} occur around gas molecules that are already present on the solid surface, rendering the Langmuir adsorption isotherm ineffective for the purposes of modelling. This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the adsorbate and tungsten was the adsorbent by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the solid adsorbent and adsorbate in the gaseous phase. From here, adsorbate molecules would either adsorb to the adsorbent or <b>desorb</b> into the gaseous phase. The probability of adsorption occurring from the precursor state is dependent on the adsorbate’s proximity to other adsorbate molecules that have already been adsorbed. If the adsorbate molecule in the precursor state is in close proximity to an adsorbate molecule that has already formed on the surface, it has a sticking probability reflected {{by the size of the}} SE constant and will either be adsorbed from the precursor state at a rate of kEC or will <b>desorb</b> into the gaseous phase at a rate of kES. If an adsorbate molecule enters the precursor state at a location that is remote from any other previously adsorbed adsorbate molecules, the sticking probability is reflected by the size of the SD constant.|$|E

40|$|Solid-phase extractions with {{adsorbents}} like Tenax {{have been}} widely used to assess bioaccessible or bioavailable concentrations and non-extractable residues (NER) of organic contaminants in soils or sediments. This paper presents an analysis of literature rate constants and fractions for rapid, slow and very slow contaminant desorption from soils and sediments. Contaminant fractions <b>desorbed</b> from sediment to Tenax in 6 or 24. h were evaluated as to their adequacy as a proxy for rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fractions, which have been shown to correlate with bioavailable concentrations. Desorption rate constants appear to decrease with increasing contaminant n-octanol-water partition coefficient. The ratio of the fraction of contaminant <b>desorbed</b> from sediment to Tenax in 6. h and the rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fraction appeared to slightly decrease on increasing contaminant hydrophobicity. This was not the case for the extraction for 24. h. Rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fractions or bioavailable fractions can be estimated, within a factor of 1. 4, by multiplying the fraction <b>desorbed</b> in 24. h by a factor of 0. 7...|$|R
40|$|Solid-phase {{extraction}} with Tenax® {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods for determining the fraction of a pollutant that <b>desorbs</b> rapidly from sediment and thus is available for living beings. In the present study, this technique has been applied to sediment contaminated in the laboratory with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dichlorodifenyldichloroethylene, and dichlorodifenyldichloroethane (generically, DDXs). The amount of chemical retained in sediment during the time of the experiment fit well with a three-phase exponential desorption model. The ratios between the rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fraction and the fraction <b>desorbed</b> during a fixed time (6 or 24 h) were calculated. The fraction <b>desorbed</b> in 6 h was lower than the rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fraction for most of PBDEs, whereas the fraction <b>desorbed</b> in 24 h exceeded the rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fraction for both groups of compounds. However, variability of these data suggests, when possible, a long time measure of desorption in order to achieve a more accurate estimation. Both the extent and the velocity of desorption were inversely related with the bromination degree and, consistently, with hydrophobicity and molecular size. In this way, low brominated PBDEs and DDXs showed a high availability relative to high brominated PBDE...|$|R
2500|$|The moving-belt {{interface}} (MBI) {{was developed}} in 1977. This interface [...] consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting [...] the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would <b>desorb</b> from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and fast-atom bombardment (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were magnetic sector and quadropole instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied {{in the analysis of}} drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988.|$|E

The desorption capacity increases with increase in the concentration of EDTA at the starting and then gets decreased.
