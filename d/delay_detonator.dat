The safety and reliability of the design is analyzed, and then the methods for realizing the design proposal are exploited. The structure of the electronic detonator, the internal control circuit structure diagram, and part of the software flowchart, are presented. The time programmable increment step of 1 millisecond is arrived at, while the programmable delay time of this system ranging from 1 to 12000 milliseconds is obtained. Taking its safety and reliability, its accuracy in delay time, and its easy of use, into account, the online programming electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonator</b> proposed in this paper will be extensively applicable to complicated blasting engineering in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{world of}} {{blasting}} and explosive use continues to evolve into one which {{relies heavily on}} measurement, quantification, process control, and information feedback {{as a means of}} contributing to operational improvements. More than ever good blast performance, once thought to be a result of someone’s “artistic ability”, is giving way to “hard science” and measurement techniques. Variability in product performance and process control is becoming less tolerable with increasing environmental issues, regulatory pressure and public awareness. The Ensign-Bickford Company has directed its research and development effort toward improving blast performance with a shock tube initiated electronic detonator. The inherent precision of a shock tube initiation signal, coupled with an electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonator,</b> will provide the explosives industry with a practical and “user friendly” approach to precision blasting challenges. Field application of this technology has revealed numerous challenges in the measurement of both product and blast performance parameters.

In this paper, {{aiming at}} the {{questions}} that electronic delay detonators have low delay precision and are easily affected by the blast wave in engineering blasting, the delay and control module circuit of electronic delay detonators is designed based on PLD, according {{to the principle of}} electronic <b>delay</b> <b>detonator.</b> The design proposal of crystal oscillator with high overload resistance and the chose of charging capacitor are put forward.

Introduce In recent years, with the development of national economy and the acceleration of social pace, the increase of the large engineering, such as urban building demolition, construction of railway, mine safety mining, and rivers flood, makes the increase of the application of the blast and expand in size. In addition, the use of blasting has a very important role in the areas of reducing labor intensity, speeding up the construction progress and ensuring project safety.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of electrical detonators: instantaneous electrical detonators (IED), short period <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> (SPD) and long period <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> (LPD). SPDs are measured in milliseconds and LPDs are measured in seconds. In situations where nanosecond accuracy is required, specifically in the implosion charges in nuclear weapons, exploding-bridgewire detonators are employed. The initial shock wave is created by vaporizing a length of a thin wire by an electric discharge. A new development is a slapper detonator, which uses thin plates accelerated by an electrically exploded wire or foil to deliver the initial shock. It is in use in some modern weapon systems. A variant of this concept is used in mining operations, when the foil is exploded by a laser pulse delivered to the foil by optical fiber.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results of induced stress measurement in damaged regions around a test tunnel excavated by smooth blasting. The blasting design was for a test tunnel excavation 8 m 2 in cross section, with an advance per round of 2. 5 m. Five rounds were performed by two types of detonators, each with a large-hole cut and perimeter holes in a 0. 4 m spacing. One is electronic detonators (EDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the right half, the other is conventional pyrotechnical long period <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> of 0. 25 deci second interval (PDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the left half. In order to compare the delay accuracy of two detonators, a series of stress measurement was performed from the tunnel wall. It was made clear that EDs had little influence on remaining rock and surface, and PDs generated a damaged region. The damaged region generated by PDs was within 1 m from the tunnel surface and vertical stress hardly acted on the damaged region. ...|$|R

40|$|In many {{open cast mining}} operations, tonnes of {{explosives}} are used in individual blasts {{and there is a}} strong commercial incentive to optimize blast design. Factors in mining operations include limiting downstream processing costs associated with fines and large boulders, limiting ground vibration and associated damage, avoiding gaseous fume from detonation products and controlling explosive and ancillary accessories (<b>delays,</b> <b>detonators</b> etc.) costs. Blast optimization can be achieved by appropriate choice of blast design (layout, explosive type and quantity, time delays on charges etc). It should be emphasized that cost of a recovery operation from a failed blast can be substantial. In support of this mining activity, computer models have been developed that combine the steady state detonation aspects of the explosive and the geo-mechanical response of the confining rock media [1]. The work described here is solely concerned with modelling how the explosive and detonation products behave and, in this activity, there has been a need for robust numerical algorithm software and routines from the Nag Fortran library (C 05, D 02 N, E 04 chapters). End users will be inclined to run the simulation solver on modest performance computers and failures in the software are not acceptable: they ma...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{application}} of moving mesh methods to a one-dimensional (time dependent) <b>detonator</b> <b>delay</b> element problem. We consider moving mesh methods based on the equidistribution principle derived by Huang et al. [1]. Adaptive mesh methods {{have been widely used}} recently to solve time dependent partial differential equations having large solution gradients. Significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency are achieved by adapting the nodes (mesh points) so that they are concentrated about areas of large solution variations. Each system of equations for the moving mesh methods is solved in conjunction with the detonator problem. In this paper, the system of ordinary differential equations that results (after discretising in space) is solved using the double precision version of the stiff ordinary differential equation solver DASSL. The numerical results clearly demonstrate that the moving mesh methods are capable of tracking the deflagration wave as it travels down the <b>detonator</b> <b>delay</b> element more accurately and more efficiently than a fixed mesh method...|$|R

40|$|Chemical time <b>delay</b> <b>detonators</b> {{are used}} to control {{blasting}} operations in mines and quarries. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic delay compositions are employed for long time delays. However, soluble barium compounds may pose environmental and health risks. Hence {{it is necessary to}} consider replacing the barium sulfate with an alternative green oxidant that has similar burn properties. Anhydrous calcium sulfate was identified as a suitable, inexpensive alternative green oxidant. The initial part of the investigation focused on characterising the burn properties of the Si-CaSO 4, as well as proposing a viable reaction mechanism for this composition. Thermochemical calculations indicated that stoichiometry corresponds to a composition that contains ca. 30 wt. % silicon (Si). Combustion was only supported in the range 30 70 wt. % Si. In this range the bomb calorimeter data and burn tests indicate that the reaction rate and energy output decrease with increasing silicon content. The compositions were filled into rigid aluminium elements and assembled into full detonators. Burn rates ranged from 6. 9 to 12. 5 mm s? 1. The reaction product was a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous calcium silicate phase. A reaction mechanism consistent with these observations is proposed. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic delay compositions are employed commercially for intermediate to long time delays. However, there is very little information on this composition available in the open literature. The reactivity of this composition was therefore characterised and compared with that of Si-CaSO 4. The Si-BaSO 4 composition supported combustion in the range of 20 to 60 wt. % Si in the bomb calorimeter. However, burning was only sustained between 20 and 40 wt. % Si in rigid aluminium tubes. The burn rates varied between 8. 4 and 16 mm s? 1. These values are comparable to those for the Si-CaSO 4 system (6. 9 12. 5 mm s? 1). However, the CaSO 4 -based formulations tended to have a higher energy output and produced a more pronounced transient pressure response than the barium sulfate compositions. Both the calcium sulfate- and barium sulfate-based formulations were insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge stimuli. The reaction products were a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous phase. Although barium sulfate is insoluble in water and decidedly non-toxic, the reaction products produced by the Si-BaSO 4 compositions were found to contain water-soluble barium compounds. This ranged from 50 to 140 mg Ba per gram of barium sulfate reacted. The burn rates of delay compositions used in detonators can be modified by varying a range of parameters in addition to the stoichiometry. With this in mind, the effect of additives and fuel particle size distribution on the burn rate of the silicon-calcium sulfate pyrotechnic delay compositions was investigated. The burn rate decreased with increase in fuel particle size, while the enthalpy remained constant. The addition of fuels to a base composition of 30 wt. % Si-CaSO 4 increased the burn rate, with an increase from 12. 5 mm s- 1 to 43 mm s- 1 being recorded on the addition of 10 wt. % Al. Ternary mixtures of silicon, calcium sulfate and an additional oxidiser generally decreased the burn rate. The exception was bismuth trioxide which increased it. The Si-CaSO 4 formulation was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of inert material as the addition of as little as 1 wt. % of fumed silica stifled combustion in the aluminium tubes.

50|$|The {{most widely}} used version of the spigot gun was the tree spigot gun. This had its spigot mounted on a {{ball and socket joint}} {{attached}} to a large wood screw. A pair of handles were provided to turn the screw so that it could be secured in a tree or other suitable wooden support; one of the handles had a chisel-shaped end for removing bark from trees. When this had been done, a sighting tool could be placed on the spigot, and the spigot was then adjusted and clamped into position. The sight was then removed and replaced with the mortar projectile. The weapon was fired by pulling on a lanyard, by a trip wire as part of a booby trap or by a pencil <b>detonator</b> <b>delay</b> mechanism. The tree spigot had a range of 200 yd. As part of a booby trap, it could be positioned to fire downwards onto the relatively thin armour on top of a tank. One account of its use describes a trip wire for a locomotive; placed up high it was likely to be missed by track walkers looking for bombs on the railway line.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considered}} bismuth (III) oxide (Bi 2 O 3) and antimony hexitatridecoxide (Sb 6 O 13) {{as potential}} substitutes {{for the red}} lead (Pb 3 O 4) and barium sulphate (BaSO 4) oxidants currently used in time <b>delay</b> compositions for <b>detonator</b> assemblies. Fine silicon powders with a specific surface area of 2 - 10 m 2 /g were used as fuels. Some experiments were also done with a coarse manganese powder as fuel. Bi 2 O 3 was synthesised by the thermal decomposition of (BiO) 2 CO 3 by heating at 460 °C for 15 hours. The yield was near quantitative, ie. close to the 91, 4 % expected based on the complete conversion of the carbonate to the oxide. Sb 6 O 13 was obtained by heating colloidal antimony pentoxide (Sb 2 O 5) for 8 hours at 315 °C. This resulted in a ca. 20 % mass loss and yielded a reactive black powder. In the Si-Bi 2 O 3 system, compositions in the range 5 - 40 % by mass Si were ignitable with shock tubing. Burn rates measured in lead tubes varied between 15 and 155 mm/s. This highest burn rate was obtained with 20 % silicon. Addition of additives such as KMnO 4 and boric oxide {{had little effect on}} the burn rate. The fast burning Si-Bi 2 O 3 system is a potential replacement for the commercial Si - red lead system. The burning rate decreased with increasing compaction of the samples. Burn rate also decreased when the aluminium instead of lead tubes were used. This is attributed to a greater heat loss with the former. The combustion products were characterised using DTA, FT-IR, XRD and SEM. The results show that the combustion reactions led to reduction of the oxidant to the corresponding metal form. The Sb 6 O 13 -Si system requires an initiating composition such as Bi 2 O 3 - 50 %Si (Type 4). It is slow burning and thus a possible replacement for the commercial BaS 04 -Si system. The lowest sustainable and reproducible burn rate, in the absence of additives, was 4, 8 mm/s. It was achieved using 10 % silicon Type 4. Adding small amounts of fumed silica < 2 %) increased the burn rate. This is attributed to better mixing and compaction. However, lower burn rates (~ 2 mm/s) are possible if more fumed silica is added as inert diluent. Replacing the silicon fuel with manganese powder gave more exothermic and even slower burning compositions. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
