50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release, and film speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>crank.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1957: Asahi Pentax (Japan; called Sears Tower 26 in USA): first SLR with {{right-handed}} rapid-wind thumb lever, first fold-out <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>crank,</b> first microprism focusing aid. First Asahi SLR with M42 screw mount. Established the [...] "modern" [...] control {{layout of}} the 35 mm SLR. Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror and pentaprism design.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>crank,</b> a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{difference}} to the conventional design was the cocking lever. On the Rollei 35, the lever {{is located at the}} top left and the <b>film</b> <b>rewinding</b> <b>crank</b> at the bottom right of the camera body (instead of the cocking lever being at the top right and the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> at the top left). The cartridge sits in {{the right side of the}} camera and correspondingly the exposures lay [...] "upside down" [...] on the film, reflected by the inverted position of the film inscriptions (type, frame numbers) of under/over landscape pictures. To change the film, the back must be slid downwards and removed fully, like on the Leica, for example.|$|R
50|$|The M5 {{departed}} from the traditional silhouette of the Leica rangefinders, that had few changes since the M3 (1954). The height and width of the body were larger (H 84 mm x W 150 mm x D 36 mm), and the body heavier (ca. 100 g more than other M cameras). The folding <b>film</b> <b>rewinding</b> <b>crank</b> hides in the bottom plate. The self-timer arm and the field-of-view preselector (now on the M5 additionally with battery test function) are of the same design as the Leica M4 (1967). The M5 was the last M to feature a mechanical self-timer (duration 5-10 seconds). The M5 incorporates an improved rapid film loading spool design over the M4. The M5 has a rapid transport lever which winds the shutter and advances the film and the frame counter in one single motion, or {{in a series of}} shorter motions. A marker for the film plane is engraved {{on the top of the}} camera housing. The M5's redesigned horizontal travelling cloth focal plane shutter is reported to be the quietest of the M series. The shutter curtains travel at a relatively low speed which has as a consequence the 1/50 second flash sync speed.|$|R
50|$|Much work {{went into}} human factors {{engineering}} {{to create an}} ergonomic user interface for the camera. The form of previous cameras was largely dictated by the required locations of mechanical controls on the body, such as the <b>film</b> advance lever, <b>rewind</b> <b>crank,</b> shutter speed dial, shutter release, etc. On the T90, the film transport control is no longer required, while the others are no longer mechanically linked. This gave the designers more freedom to shape the camera {{to make it easier}} to control and hold, and to place controls in a way that suited the user rather than a mechanical design.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>crank.</b> Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can {{be connected to the}} Nikon shoe via the Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler.|$|E
5000|$|The FT's {{exposure}} control system was a [...] "center-the-needle" [...] system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically {{at the lower}} {{right side of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> to allow {{exposure control}} without looking through the viewfinder. The meter was turned on by pulling the film wind lever out to the standby ready position and turned off by pushing it back flush against the camera.|$|E
5000|$|... 1964: Kodak Retina Reflex IV (USA/West Germany): first SLR with {{standard}} ISO hot shoe atop the pentaprism housing for direct flash mounting and synchronization. Was a 35 mm, leaf shutter design. A flash {{is a necessary}} accessory for auxiliary or fill light in dim or high contrast conditions. The first camera {{with any kind of}} hot shoe connector was the Univex Mercury (USA) non-SLR half frame 35 mm in 1938 and many post World War 2 non-SLRs (such as the Bell & Howell Foton USA 35 mm rangefinder) had a Leica-type accessory shoe with added electrical contact (the present day ISO hot shoe). Although the Nikon F (see above) had a non-ISO hot shoe surrounding the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> in 1959, most 1960s 35 mm SLRs used screw-on accessory shoes attached to the eyepiece to mount flashes but a PC cable socket to sync them. The ISO hot shoe became a standard SLR feature in the early 1970s. However, in 1971, SLRs using [...] "dedicated" [...] electronic flashes with automatic flash exposure control began appearing with the Canon FTb (Japan). They used ISO-style shoes with extra electrical contacts. Each SLR brand used incompatible contact configurations and the time of use-any-flash-with-any-SLR passed by the late 1970s. Note, although the hot shoe had been de facto standardized in the 1950s, the International Organization for Standardization did not promulgate its ISO 518 hot shoe specification until 1977.|$|E
50|$|Film {{transport}} is {{very different}} from Leica M-mount film cameras, which require manual film handling through a removable bottom plate and flip-up camera back, with <b>film</b> advance and <b>rewind</b> using manual levers and <b>rewind</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Added a detent to the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> {{to allow}} it to stay put when pulled out.|$|R
5000|$|Film advance: Manual lever and <b>rewind</b> <b>crank,</b> add-on winder (2fps, manual rewind) {{and motor}} (5fps, {{motorized}} rewind) units available ...|$|R
50|$|The Contaflex Rapid was {{introduced}} in 1958 and had a slightly longer body, a built-in accessory shoe, a winding lever and a <b>rewind</b> <b>crank.</b> It was the meterless version.|$|R
50|$|For {{the mercury}} battery PX 13 (= PX 625 = MR 9) {{of the light}} meter, a place was found inside the camera housing. The <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob of the {{engineering}} model was exchanged for a <b>rewind</b> <b>crank,</b> and a hot shoe was added for mounting an electronic flash at the base plate. Placing the hot shoe {{on top of the}} camera was not feasible because of the underlying exposure meter andtransmission gear. Mounting the hot shoe at the frame cover would likely cause damage when using one of the heavy flash lights of that time. Therefore, for a natural lighting shade, the camera had to be turned upside down, when using a flash, to get the light source above the lens. The projected name for the camera was at first to be the Rollei Privat, which even was the engraving on the final draft in March 1966. But in April 1966, when Peesel decided to designate all Rollei cameras according to the applied film format, the designation became Rollei 35.|$|R
5000|$|M4 - 1967-75 (50,000 {{sets were}} manufactured); 1974-75 (6,500 sets were manufactured). With added {{rangefinder}} framelines for 35 mm and 135 mm lenses. Introduced the canted <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> (the previous Ms had rewind knobs). With the M5, {{was the last}} M camera to have a self-timer.|$|R
50|$|The Spotmatic II (SPII) heralded {{the arrival}} of the SMC lenses.Among some {{improvements}} were better metering system (Max ASA was increased to 3200) and film transport.A hot shoe for flash was added and the synchronization (FP or X) was placed on a dial switch located below the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank.</b>|$|R
50|$|When The Kodak {{stereo camera}} was finally {{released}} {{at the end}} of 1954 it was an instant hit. The price tag, $84.50, about half the price of a Realist, certainly helped, but so did the ease of use, especially the self-cocking shutter, <b>rewind</b> <b>crank,</b> and controls easily set from the top. When this was combined with the trusted Kodak name, {{it is not surprising that}} it was sold so well.|$|R
50|$|During its {{production}} run, Nikon replaced the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> spool for these cameras {{due to a}} manufacturing defect.|$|R
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob with <b>film</b> reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> release button.|$|R

50|$|There is a self timer, flash, autofocus, ISO range, and <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The ISO {{range is}} a black slider {{on the bottom of}} the camera.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon SP has dual viewfinders {{providing}} frame {{lines for}} a total of six focal lengths. The main viewfinder has 1x magnification and has frame lines for 50 mm, 85 mm, 105 mm and 135 mm (selected by rotating a dial under the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank).</b> The frames are parallax-corrected and the focusing patch appears in the centre of the viewfinder. A separate, smaller viewfinder (less than life size) {{to the left of the}} main viewfinder has non-parallax corrected frame lines for 35 mm. The entire window acts as a frame for 28 mm lenses.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Leech {{appeared}} in the HBO drama series Rome as Marcus Agrippa, Octavian's top soldier and friend. The <b>film,</b> <b>Rewind,</b> opened in Ireland on 25 March 2011.|$|R

50|$|At {{this point}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> to the opening scene when Angélique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the {{delivery}} boy and the subsequent events play out from Loïc's viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} 30 years {{the vast majority}} of SLRs standardized the layout of the controls. The film was transported from left to right, so the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> was on the left, followed in order by the pentaprism, shutter speed dial, shutter release and the film advance lever, which in some cameras was ratcheted so that multiple strokes could be used to advance the film. Some cameras, such as Nikon's Nikkormat FT cameras (marketed under the brand-name 'Nikormat' in European countries and elsewhere) and some models of Olympus OM series, deviated from this layout by placing the shutter speed control as a ring around the lens mount.|$|R
5000|$|MP - 2003 - current model (as of 2015). 35mm film. A {{homage to}} the {{original}} MP, the new MP (this time standing for [...] "Mechanical Perfection") cosmetically resembles the original (even down to changing the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> back to a knob) but is functionally closer to the M6 Classic. A notable improvement over the M6 was the modification of the rangefinder to eliminate flare. The Leicavit M is an accessory introduced with the new MP, allowing trigger wind with the right hand at speeds up to 2-2.5 frame/s. The MP is available in chrome and black paint and with viewfinders of [...]58, [...]72 and [...]85 magnification.|$|R
5000|$|All their SLR cameras, {{except the}} dx-3, had {{interchangeable}} pentaprisms (released by moving a button or twisting {{the base of}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob), and a unique dual lens mount; an external bayonet mount or a 44mm thread mount within the mirror box.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, Roma started {{manufacturing}} and selling cameras {{under the name}} [...] "Siciliano Camera Works". He produced the medium format [...] "Siciliano", the 35mm panoramic [...] "Pannaroma", {{as well as a}} <b>rewind</b> <b>crank</b> for the Leica M2 & M3. To create the panoramic camera, Roma used a Nikon F camera body that was gutted and served merely as a film holder. He milled an adapter out of aircraft aluminum to go between the Nikon body and a Mamiya 50mm Sekor lens. He also made a bright-line optical viewfinder for the camera. The camera was called a “Pannaroma 1X3″, making a play on words between “panorama” and Roma’s wife’s name “Anna,” to create the word [...] "P-anna-roma".|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF has a hinged, swing-open, {{camera back}} with cut-out view window {{to show the}} film loaded in the camera. Film loading, advance and rewind is {{motorised}} and automatic. A button to manually trigger <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> is also provided. Film sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encoding or the ISO value can be selected manually.|$|R
50|$|Henenlotter {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film</b> <b>Rewind</b> This!, {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video. He also appeared with the film's director, Josh Johnson, when it screened at film festivals such as the Telluride Horror Show. In 2014, he directed Chasing Banksy, which was screened with a visit of Henenlotter at New York City Forbidden Planet.|$|R
50|$|Exposure {{control was}} {{aperture}} priority AE using center-weighted light metering. Film speeds {{of the camera}} range from ASA 25 to ASA 1600. Film winding was done by using the film-wind lever located on the top right of the camera. <b>Film</b> <b>rewinding</b> was done manually using the film-rewind crank located at the top left. The camera body measured 136 × 83 × 50 mm and weighed approximately 430 g.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{removable}} viewfinder, the F-1's flash coupler originally attached atop the <b>rewind</b> <b>crank.</b> Initially, {{there were two}} flash couplers, D and L. The D model was a simple x-synch coupler that allowed any non-dedicated manual or auto flash to be used. The Flash Coupler L contained two batteries (now hard to find, one being originally a 1.35v mercuric oxide and the other being the uncommon PX-1 size), one which powered a light to light up the metering window visible in the viewfinder, {{and the other to}} work with the original Canon Auto tuning system (CATS). The CATS used a special auto flash, the SpeedLite 133D and Flash auto Rings A, B, A2 and B2 and Canon 50 mm and 35 mm Lenses which signalled through the cords the distance of the subject and the charge level of the flash to allow match needle flash photography.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of a static application, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) product Clevios P (Figure 7) from Heraeus has been {{extensively}} used as an antistatic coating (as packaging materials for electronic components, for example). AGFA coats 200 m × 10 m of photographic film per year with PEDOT:PSS because of its antistatic properties. The thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is virtually transparent and colorless, prevents electrostatic discharges during <b>film</b> <b>rewinding,</b> and reduces dust buildup on the negatives after processing.|$|R
50|$|Accessories for the OM-4 {{included}} all the Olympus motor drives {{made for the}} OM-System cameras. Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to automatic film advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes. The T45 handle-mount electronic flash (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) was also introduced with the OM-4.|$|R
