5|$|In some countries, <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{spread of}} STDs have {{prompted}} {{the closing of}} bathhouseswith their private roomsin favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity {{takes place in the}} open, and can be observed by monitors {{whose job it is to}} enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend {{as a vehicle for}} exploring anxieties about gender and <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the artist}} himself, much of his early work was {{inspired}} by a sense of looming environmental calamity. In 2011, he stated that [...] "I wanted to express this strange un-locatable feeling of <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> end of the world - my generation’s zeitgeist of global warming." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the fourth}} season, Turk is {{diagnosed}} with type two diabetes; he initially jokes {{about this as}} a way of coping with his <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disease, but learns to take it seriously. In the seventh season, Turk has a testicle removed after his daughter, Izzy, kicks him in the groin, causing testicular torsion.|$|R
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> event's safety and delayed their decision on whether to allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the licence application. The local fire service were also concerned about access {{in the event of a}} fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on the 8 and 9 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam ships during the 1840s {{created a new}} risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Further worries about France, combined {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> security of the south coast. As a result, the Grand Battery at Dartmouth Castle was rebuilt and retitled the Dartmouth Point Battery, with shell-proof, granite defences protecting three traversing gun emplacements looking out to sea, and a further two guns on the roof; one small howitzer protected the entrance to the harbour itself. It was manned by three professional soldiers, and a team of over fifty-five reservists, drawn from the newly formed Sixth Devonshire Artillery Volunteer Corps. The castle, however, was of low military priority, only of importance because the harbour might be used to as a staging post to attack Plymouth, and the guns allocated it were old-fashioned. A further upgrade in 1888 again installed only out-dated artillery pieces.|$|E
60|$|DEAR BOY,--I {{have been}} nearly smashed altogether; fever and chills, with really very {{considerable}} suffering; {{and to my}} deep gloom and some <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future, work has had to stop. There was no way out of it; yesterday and to-day nothing would come, it was a mere waste of tissue, productive of spoiled paper.|$|R
50|$|In the new treaty France {{agreed to}} assist Austria in regaining the {{province}} of Silesia from Prussia in exchange for Austria ceding the Austrian Netherlands to France at the war's conclusion - the acquisition of which had long been a goal of the French state. Financial subsidies paid from France to Austria were continued. This confirmed a British <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> depth of the alliance.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the ground}} work for {{apartheid}} began earlier, the report provided {{support for this}} central idea of black inferiority. This was used to justify racial segregation and discrimination in the following decades. <b>The</b> report expressed <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss of white racial pride, and in particular pointed to the danger that the poor white {{would not be able}} to resist the process of [...] "Africanisation".|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> safety of wooden {{aircraft}} structures drove the US aviation industry to develop all-metal airliners. United Airlines had exclusive {{right to the}} all metal twin-engine Boeing 247; rival TWA issued a specification for an all-metal trimotor.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{scientists}} consider these <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dangers of METI as panic and irrational superstition; see, for example, Alexander L. Zaitsev's papers. Biologist João Pedro de Magalhães also proposed in 2015 transmitting an invitation message to any extraterrestrial intelligences watching us {{already in the}} context of the Zoo Hypothesis and inviting them to respond, arguing this would not put us in any more danger than we are already if the Zoo Hypothesis is correct.|$|E

The plan received opposition from the local community, due to <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> transmission of the disease at the time. On July 31, a Queens judge blocked the move. Koch proceeded to drop the plans on September 3.|$|E

50|$|The Women's Crisis Centre {{started in}} August 1984. The {{founding}} group met in 1983, when women {{of a variety}} of races, nationalities, religions and beliefs, got together and expressed a <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> number of sexual attacks on women in and around the city of Suva. The group was worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of support for women. There was no official body to provide help, so the women decided to work towards providing such a service themselves.|$|R
25|$|After Zhao became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, his {{proposals}} in May 1988 to expand free enterprise led to popular complaints (which some suggest were politically inspired) about inflation fears. Public <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{negative effects of}} market reforms gave conservatives (including Li Peng) the opening to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influences, especially opposing further expansion of Zhao's more free enterprise-oriented approach. This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988–1989.|$|E
25|$|La Follette {{believed}} his <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> American economy were confirmed during the Bankers' Panic of 1907. La Follette opposed Aldrich's proposal (which {{had been created}} {{with the aid of}} financiers such as Paul Warburg). He saw the plan to issue $500million in emergency currency backed in part by railroad bonds as an effort to establish economic centralization and crush free institutions. La Follette's troubles in the Senate worsened when fellow Progressive Theodore Roosevelt did not seek another term and William Howard Taft became President in 1909.|$|E

25|$|The {{last months}} of {{pregnancy}} of Aspasia {{are surrounded by}} intrigue. In the case that she gave birth a boy (who would be named Philip, {{as the father of}} Alexander the Great), rumours soon assured that she was determined to place him on the throne after his birth. True or not, this possibility worried the Greek royal family, whose <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> birth of a male child were exploited by the Venizelists to revive the succession crisis. The birth of a girl, on 25 March 1921 was a great relief for the dynasty and both King Constantine I and his mother Queen Dowager Olga agreed to be the godparents of the newborn.|$|E
25|$|Cybersecurity {{emerged as}} an {{important}} issue during Obama's presidency. In 2009, the Obama administration established United States Cyber Command, an armed forces sub-unified command charged with defending the military against cyber attacks. Sony Pictures suffered a major hack in 2014, which the US government alleges originated from North Korea {{in retaliation for the}} release of the film The Interview. China also developed sophisticated cyber-warfare forces. In 2015, Obama declared cyber-attacks on the US a national emergency. Later that year, Obama signed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act into law. In 2016, the Democratic National Committee and other US organizations were hacked, and the FBI and CIA concluded that Russia sponsored the hacking in hopes of helping Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. The email accounts of other prominent individuals, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell and CIA Director John O. Brennan, were also hacked, leading to new <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> confidentiality of emails.|$|E
25|$|In early February, the {{government}} and the FARC once again found themselves at odds, {{on the issue of the}} plebiscite. The FARC, by communiqué, argued that the plebiscite contravened the general agreement (from August 2012). In response, President Santos tweeted that the final agreement in Havana would be submitted to plebiscite, whether the FARC liked it or not. In late February, the FARC's 'armed proselytism' during a 'political pedagogy' event (attended by Iván Marquez and other negotiators) in La Guajira stirred significant controversy. Since 2015, the FARC's negotiators had been authorized by {{the government}} to travel to Colombia to organize 'political pedagogy' events with their troops only, and till then all such activities had occurred without major problems. However, the presence of armed men mingling with the civilian population during this particular event in La Guajira rekindled <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of weapons by the guerrilla during political events. President Santos notified the guerrilla that 'political pedagogy' events were suspended until further notice and issued an ultimatum that either a final agreement is signed on March 23 or it would be understood that the FARC are not ready for peace. Semana considered the incident as a major blow to confidence and trust in the peace process, which came at a critical moment.|$|E
30|$|Currently, the world’s {{economy is}} running on crude oil, a limited resource.

But the wastefulness of crude oil causes harm to the earth and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> end of cheap oil is a widespread concern in people’s mind.

500|$|In Britain the {{successful}} defence {{of the islands}} was highly praised and Price was promoted as a reward, although Bourne was not, despite a recommendation in the official report. British losses included a single marine killed and four other personnel wounded. The victory was seen in Britain as a foreshadowing of the likely fate of an attempted invasion and helped ease British <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> threat of a French amphibious attack. Nearly five decades later the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Isles St. Marcou" [...] upon application to all British participants then still living.|$|E
