40|$|The faecal {{contamination}} of water sources can cause waterborne disease outbreaks among drinking water consumers. To design drinking water treatment and minimise consumer health risks, knowledge on source water quality is needed. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to describe the microbial water quality in water sources {{in order to facilitate}} the provision of safe drinking water. In this thesis, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>modelling,</b> microbial source tracking (MST), and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) were combined to study two surface drinking water sources, Lake Rådasjön and the river Göta älv in Sweden. The microbial water quality in these water sources was successfully characterised by the developed <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>models.</b> The results demonstrated that the concentrations of faecal indicators and pathogens in these water sources vary and are event-driven. In the lake, the contaminant transport was strongly affected by wind conditions and by the vertical temperature stratification; in the river, the contaminant transport was driven by the water flow. Both for the lake and river, human faecal sources were the main contributors to the contamination at the water intakes. Based on the obtained results, recommendations for the management of the microbial risks concerning the studied water sources were formulated. It can be concluded that <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> is a very useful approach to describe and predict the microbial water quality in drinking water sources. In this thesis, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> was successfully applied to study the factors that affect the contaminant spread in the water source, to capture the spatial and temporal variability of the microbial water quality, to provide short-term forecasts, and to test hypothetical scenarios. Furthermore, the results of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> improved the interpretation of the MST data and provided input for QMRA. The novelty of this thesis lies in using <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> in combination with MST and QMRA, in order to enhance the applicability and output of each individual approach, and to describe and predict the microbial water quality in drinking water sources...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} studies have {{predicted}} more frequent and intensive storms as a result of climate change in UK {{and other parts of the}} world, which may consequently cause more hazardous flash floods in steep catchments of small to medium size (e. g. up to 100 km 2). These flash floods are commonly characterized by high-velocity overland flow as a result of rapid catchment response to the intense rainfall. The hydrological processes related to the rapid catchment response are poorly understood and reliable prediction is generally beyond the capability of traditional hydrological <b>models</b> or simplified <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>models.</b> This work aims to present a shock-capturing <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> system to simulate the complex rainfall-runoff and the subsequent flash surface flooding process in a rapid-response catchment. The model solves the fully 2 D shallow water equations using a finite volume Godunov-type shock-capturing numerical scheme for the rapidly varying overland flow hydrodynamics following intense rainfall. Typically, this type of shock-capturing <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>models</b> is not able to provide efficient and high-resolution simulations for large-scale flash flood events due to their high computational demand. In order to substantially improve the computational efficiency and enable catchment-scale simulations at very high resolution involving millions of computational nodes, the model is implemented on GPUs for high-performance parallel computing.
