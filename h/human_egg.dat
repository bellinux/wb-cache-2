25|$|Stem cell experts {{consider}} {{it unlikely that}} such large numbers of <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use {{on a large scale}} on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.|$|E
2500|$|To {{address the}} problem of {{creating}} a <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> market, some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs.

2500|$|In January 2008, Dr. Andrew French and Samuel Wood of the {{biotechnology}} company Stemagen {{announced that}} they successfully created the first five mature human embryos using SCNT. In this case, each embryo was created by taking a nucleus from a skin cell (donated by Wood and a colleague) and inserting it into a <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> from which the nucleus had been removed. The embryos were developed only to the blastocyst stage, at which point they were studied in processes that destroyed them. [...] Members of the lab said that their next set of experiments would aim to generate embryonic stem cell lines; these are the [...] "holy grail" [...] that would be useful for therapeutic or reproductive cloning.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{produced}} an Audience Research report for episodes one, five and seven. Many respondents criticised the serial for being slow {{and full of}} scientific terminology. However, as the serial progressed, viewers became more enthusiastic; after episode five, one viewer said, [...] "The serial, like Andromeda herself, suddenly came alive. This episode was spine-chilling". Another commented [...] "I didn't like the way Andromeda was created – it is absolutely against Christian belief". J.A.K. Fraser of Dornock, Scotland, wrote to the BBC's correspondence programme Points of View, saying, [...] "Enough surely has been seen of Prof. Fleming's overacted hysterical outbursts". Writing to the Radio Times, B.W. Wolfe of Basingstoke said, [...] "Congratulations on the recent BBC-tv science-fiction serial A for Andromeda. Bug-eyed monsters we have seen before, but never a creature so radiantly beautiful as Andromeda herself. I was completely captivated". Other letter writers to the Radio Times discussed the scientific accuracy of the serial including one correspondent, C.W. Bartlett of Watford, who wrote to inform readers that the reference to DNA (then newly discovered) was not a fictional substance but really existed. This was expounded upon by the Daily Mail which drew comparisons {{with the creation of}} Andromeda and an announcement from Italy and Russia that scientists had fertilised a <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> outside of the womb; [...] "These are tough times for the science fiction writer", the paper wrote, [...] "Jules Verne and H. G. Wells have long been left {{in the wake of the}} rocket, the H-bomb and the atom submarine. Now our own Fred Hoyle is desperately trying to keep a jump ahead of his fellow scientists in the laboratory".|$|E

40|$|Aneuploidy in <b>human</b> <b>eggs</b> is {{the leading}} cause of {{pregnancy}} loss and several genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Most aneuploidy results from chromosome segregation errors during the meiotic divisions of an oocyte, the egg’s progenitor cell. The basis for particularly error-prone chromosome segregation in human oocytes is not known. We analyzed meiosis in more than 100 live human oocytes and identified an error-prone chromosome-mediated spindle assembly mechanism as a major contributor to chromosome segregation defects. Human oocytes assembled a meiotic spindle independently of either centrosomes or other microtubule organizing centers. Instead, spindle assembly was mediated by chromosomes and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran in a process requiring ~ 16 hours. This unusually long spindle assembly period was marked by intrinsic spindle instability and abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which favor chromosome segregation errors and provide a possible explanation for high rates of aneuploidy in <b>human</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|R
50|$|Human {{fertilization}} is {{the union}} of a <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is {{the production of a}} zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|The true shock {{came when}} it was {{uncovered}} that the Sarcophagus is, in fact, a sophisticated incubator containing 13 fertilized, but latent <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> cells. Shortly after that Gennady Komov, {{the director of the}} expedition to EN-9173, ordered to classify any information on this discovery, therefore nearly nothing about it was known to the public.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> {{contains}} only {{one set of}} chromosomes (23) and {{is said to be}} haploid. Sperm also have only one set of 23 chromosomes and are therefore haploid.

50|$|In June 2008, the Centre {{announced}} that it had begun working on induced pluripotent (iPS) cells (human embryonic stem cells, artificially created without <b>human</b> <b>eggs</b> or embryos). This {{was the first time}} in Australia that such research had been carried out, and the first time that scientists had worked on this type of stem cell outside the US or Japan.|$|R
25|$|A second {{important}} {{concern is}} the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires <b>human</b> <b>eggs,</b> {{which can only be}} obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{diagnosis}} for dicrocoeliasis infection {{involves the}} identification of Dicrocoelium dendriticum eggs in the faeces of a human or other animal. However, in <b>humans,</b> <b>eggs</b> in the stool may {{be a result of}} ingesting raw infected animal liver and may not in fact indicate dicrocoeliasis. Therefore, examining bile or duodenal fluid for eggs is a more accurate diagnostic technique in combination with a liver-free diet.|$|R
50|$|To {{build the}} ovary, {{honeycombs}} of theca cells were formed, {{one of two}} key types in the ovary, donated by reproductive-age patients at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Together with <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> cells, donated granulosa cells were inserted into the honeycomb shape the theca cells formed. In days, the theca cells enveloped the granulosa and eggs, mimicking a real ovary.|$|E
50|$|In a {{clinical}} setting the cells must be immunocompatible with the recipient patient. They could {{be derived from}} the patient's embryonic pluripotent stem cells {{as well as by}} somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In SCNT the nucleus is introduced into a <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> producing embryonic stem cells that are a genetic match of the patient. Another approach takes cells discarded after a diagnostic prenatal amniocentesis.|$|E
5000|$|A {{therapy for}} {{mitochondrial}} diseases that Mitalipov discovered, the [...] "spindle transfer" [...] technique, involves removing the nucleus from a <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> and placing it into another.

The possibility of using the procedure on human eggs has raised safety and ethics questions.|$|E

5000|$|In this work, Carson, et al. {{introduced}} theca cells {{donated by}} reproductive-age patients into [...] "3-D Petri dishes" [...] designed {{to resemble the}} sponge-like cells of a human ovary.

50|$|In {{parallel}} with this effort and a scientific first, Carson co-directed a research team by extracting information about gene expression from fertile <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> cells without hurting them.

25|$|In Cyprus in 2010 police {{closed a}} {{fertility}} clinic under charges of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>eggs.</b> The Petra Clinic, {{as it was}} known locally, imported women from Ukraine and Russia for egg harvesting and sold the genetic material to foreign fertility tourists.

2500|$|Marleau {{received}} {{a report on}} new reproductive technologies shortly after her appointment as Health Minister, and welcomed its primary thesis that conception and child-bearing should not become for-profit industries. [...] She reiterated this view in late 1994, when speaking {{about the need for}} legislation to prevent the sale of <b>human</b> sperm and <b>eggs.</b> [...] She called for a voluntary moratorium on commercial surrogate motherhood contracts the following year, as a first step toward greater regulation. [...] Some believed this approach fell short of the 1993 report's recommendations, and expressed concern that it would be ineffective. [...] Marleau later acknowledged that the voluntary approach was not successful, and indicated that legislation banning the sale of <b>human</b> <b>eggs</b> was forthcoming. [...] Her successor introduced the legislation in June 1996.|$|R
