40|$|The Commission's Guidance {{paper on}} <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> under Article 82 EC {{is open to}} three {{fundamental}} criticisms. First, it leads to less legal certainty, because the rules suggested are vague and imprecise, because dominant companies {{will not have the}} information needed to apply them, and because the Commission is trying to change the law, which it has no power to do. Second, it would lead to some anticompetitive effects, because in practice it discourages price competition, by discouraging individualised price negotiations and retroactive rebates, and by suggesting that the Commission will protect not-yet-as-efficient competitors from price competition. Third, it leads to too many "false positives", i. e., findings of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> that are not justified in economics or law. The solution is to return to the test in the Treaty as interpreted by the Court of Justice: an <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> must involve limiting the production, marketing or technical development of competitors of the dominant company, if harm is caused to consumers.

40|$|We analyze history-based price {{discrimination}} in an asymmetric industry, where an incumbent, protected by switching costs, faces an entrant {{who does not}} have access to information about consumers' purchase histories. We demonstrate that consumer surplus is higher with uniform pricing than with history-based {{price discrimination}}. We find that the entry decision is invariant to whether the incumbent implements history-based pricing or uniform pricing. This implies that the potential abuse of market dominance imposed by history-based price discrimination is exploitation, not exclusion. Finally, we establish that the profit gain to the incumbent from history-based pricing exceeds the associated loss to consumers.

40|$|The book {{approaches}} the substantive provisions on {{the abuse of}} dominance by undertakings, the relevant economic and historically rooted approaches, including EU competition policy goals after Lisbon, based on the German and Romanian legal context, competition enforcement and experience. It analyses the relevance of stricter national rules especially of non-dominant undertakings based on traders’ performance as a distinct field of law focused on the exploitative abuse as unfair methods of competition. It highlights how the Commission’s Guidance Paper included an incipient model of more effects-based competition law that departs from the static market structure focus on <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> and focuses on harm and efficiencies. It also covers recent cases on the misuse of {{intellectual and industrial property}} rights, including unified standards and smaller businesses, and explains the thin borderline between free and fair competition based on open markets and public policy, with innovation balancing respectively. The book gradually advances new interpretations of Article 102 TFEU to include dynamic competition and concludes with a developing Union trading law in need of a Regulation governing aspects of fair competition and relevant administrative criteria...|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers an}} {{original}} {{interpretation of the}} case law on <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> under Article 82 EC (now Article 102 TFEU, according to the numbering introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon), and it identifies the various factors that have shaped the application of this provision through its history. The book {{provides an in-depth analysis}} of the European Commission's Guidance on enforcement priorities under Article 82 and it makes a provocative proposal for further modernisation of the analysis of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> by recasting the prohibition of abuse of dominance as a norm which deals only with unilateral conduct. The first part of the book reconsiders fundamental legal and economic concepts underpinning the assessment of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> and identifies the difficulties posed by the principal forms of abusive practices (refusals to deal, predatory pricing, rebates and tying). The EU case law is compared with the US experience under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The second part of the book explores solutions, {{based on the premise that}} the reform of Article 82 (now Article 102 TFEU) should be in line with the modernisation of Article 81 (now Article 101 TFEU) and the EU merger control rules. The last chapter demonstrates the gradual convergence of the application of Articles 81 and 82 in the area of vertical restraints. It points towards a redefined division of labour between these two provisions with a view to ensuring efficient enforcement, better protection of consumer interests, and clearer incentives for dominant firms to invest in desirable commercial practices. The book will be of interest to students and practitioners of EU competition law, and to those in other jurisdictions where the application of competition law to practices of dominant firms is controversial.

40|$|Unfair trade {{practices}} (UTPs) demonstrate anticompetitive behavior {{which can}} be characterized into two general types: <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> - an act of the firm (or a group of firms) to prevent entry of potential firms; or exploitative abuse - referring to actual abuse of market power. However, this study adopts a narrower definition of UTPs which are wrongful or deceptive practices implemented by a business that cause an economic injury to a consumer (B 2 C) or another business (B 2 B). A survey was conducted {{to determine the extent}} and awareness of UTPs in the Philippines. The main finding from the survey results is that many respondents indicate that UTPs are moderately to highly widespread. Moreover, an overwhelming majority believes that UTPs have adverse impacts on business transactions and consumer welfare. However, not many are aware of the legal remedies against UTPs. Moreover, business firms interviewed are reluctant to participate in legal action against UTPs. The reluctance pursue legal channels against UTPs may imply that there are gaps in the legal infrastructure to address B 2 B UTPs. The survey results can also be interpreted to mean that while businesses are aware of the adverse impacts of UTPs, they do not seek to "rock the boat. " The latter is consistent with the lack of a 'culture of competition' in the Philippines. This can be partly addressed by the establishment of a comprehensive competition law...|$|E
40|$|The objective(s) of Article 102 TFEU, {{what exactly}} makes a {{practice}} abusive {{and the standard}} of harm under Article 102 TFEU {{have not yet been}} settled. This lack of clarity creates uncertainty for businesses and, coupled with the current state of economics in this area, raises an important question of legitimacy. Using law and economic approaches, this book inquires into the possible objectives of Article 102 TFEU and proposes a modern approach to interpreting 'abuse'. In doing so, this book establishes an overarching concept of 'abuse' that conforms to the historical roots of the provision, to the text of the provision itself, and to modern economic thinking on unilateral conduct. This book therefore inquires into what Article 102 TFEU is about, what it can be about and what it should be about regarding both objectives and scope. The book demonstrates that the separation of exploitative abuse from <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> is artificial and unsound. It examines the roots of Article 102 TFEU and the historical context of the adoption of the Treaty, the case law, policy and literature on exploitative abuses and, where relevant, on exclusionary abuses. The book investigates potential objectives, such as fairness and welfare, as well as the potential conflict between such objectives. Finally, it critically assesses the European Commission's modernisation of Article 102 TFEU, before proposing a reformed approach to 'abuse' which is centred on three necessary and sufficient conditions: exploitation, exclusion and a lack of an increase in efficiency...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} widely felt that the law and {{economics}} under Article 82 EC on abuse of dominant positions are unsatisfactory, and that a Commission Notice stating and, where necessary, modifying the legal position is needed. This paper summarises the main points that a Notice needs to explain and gives the reasons why. This paper uses the now generally accepted classification of abuses into exploitative abuses (taking advantage of dominant positions: Article 82 (a)) : exclusionary or anticompetitive abuses (reducing or impeding competition: Article 82 (b)) : discrimination (Article 82 (c)) and reprisal abuses (conduct warning or punishing another company for competing vigorously or complaining to a competition authority). Some questions arise in connection with {{at least the first}} three kinds of abuse, but it will be seen that the most important questions concern the second kind. It is the kind that is most frequently found or alleged. So this paper gives more emphasis to the issues concerning exclusionary abuses. The paper begins with these issues, and discusses the main issues concerning other kinds of abuses separately. The structure of this paper is as follows: Part I lists the requirements that a satisfactory Notice will need to fulfil. Part II proposes a legal definition of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuse</b> based on Article 82 (b). Part III considers several basic questions about other kinds of abuses. Part IV analyses pricing abuses, on which the Community law needs to be clarified or corrected. Part V compares several economic tests of foreclosure or monopolisation, discussed in the USA, with Article 82 (b). Part VI sets out conclusions...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> by dominant firms {{is by no}} means an easy task. This is particularly true for pricing abuses, as there is no clear-cut way of distinguishing a price cut that is abusive from one that instead is pro-competitive. We argue that there are several shortcomings in the way the European Commission as assessed <b>exclusionary</b> pricing <b>abuses</b> in two important decisions concerning Internet access service markets: Deutsche Telekom AG and Wanadoo Interactive. First of all, in computing downstream costs to apply the price squeeze test the incumbent’s economies of scale and unavoidable costs should be factored in, as the test is only meant to establish whether an as-efficient competitor has been unlawfully foreclosed. Secondly, since the price squeeze test provides only for a necessary condition for predation to occur, it is also necessary to prove that the recoupment of initial losses is a plausible scenario so that the conduct under examination may indeed turn out to be harmful to consumers. This is all but a trivial task, as there are some sources of endogeneity that may cause a radical change in the underlying market structure. Particularly, in markets at early stage of development, entry barriers that may facilitate the recoupment of initial losses ex-ante may cause a change such that market structure no longer supports recoupment ex-post.

40|$|The European {{debate on}} abuse of {{dominance}} issues in antitrust has been recently {{characterized by an}} emphasis on purely economic aspects, and by an emerging consensus {{on the merits of}} taking an “effects-based approach” aimed at the maximization of consumer welfare and the protection of competition. The European Commission has recently issued a Guidance Paper on <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> which purports to move EU enforcement on abuse of dominance in this direction. In spite of these developments, we are still far from reaching any consensus on the best way to apply competition policy to specific issues such as predatory pricing, bundling, vertical restraints, exclusive dealing and so on. We analyze the genesis of the European approach to antitrust and discuss the leading economic theories on competition policy and abuse of dominance, as developed by the Chicago School, the post-Chicago approach and the endogenous market structures approach. Finally, we use these economic foundations to analyze the EU approach to abuse of dominance, we examine the Guidance Paper, we provide a comparison with the American approach, and we discuss the implications of some recent important cases. ...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, the {{fundamental}} question is under what conditions loyalty discounts and rebates adopted by a dominant firm cause anti-competitive effects. Fidelity schemes, al-though extremely frequent in the market, if applied by a dominant firm, {{are likely to be}} judged as illegal per se, as demonstrated by the EU case-law delivered so far and the se-vere scrutiny reserved by the national competition authorities. As a result, the paper first provides an analytical overview of loyalty structures, focusing in particular on retroactive rebates, and elaborates on important economic implications, such as the lock-in and the suction effect. The work then discusses the novelties introduced by the Guidance Paper on the Application of Art. 102 of the TFEU, which calls for an effects-based analysis of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses.</b> Therefore, after an in-depth evaluation of the as-efficient competitor test, the new approach of the European Commission towards loyalty discounts and rebates is discussed in details with reference to a controversial antitrust case recently examined at EU level (Tomra). The paper finally proposes a systematic economic framework for analysing the effects, and therefore the legality, of fidelity schemes, in the light of a con...|$|R
40|$|As the European Commission’s {{antitrust}} investigation against Google approaches {{its final}} stages, its contours and likely outcome remain obscure and blurred by {{a plethora of}} non antitrust-related arguments. At the same time, the initial focus on search neutrality as an antitrust principle {{seems to have been}} abandoned by the European Commission, in favour of a more standard allegation of ‘exclusionary abuse’, likely to generate anticompetitive foreclosure of Google’s rivals. This paper discusses search neutrality as an antitrust principle, and then comments on the current investigation based on publicly available information. The paper provides a critical assessment of the likely tests that will be used for the definition of the relevant product market, the criteria for the finding of dominance, the anticompetitive foreclosure test and the possible remedies that the European Commission might choose. Overall, and regardless of the outcome of the Google case, the paper argues that the current treatment of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> in Internet markets is in urgent need of a number of important clarifications, and has been in this condition for more than a decade. The hope is that the European Commission will resist the temptation to imbue the antitrust case with an emphasis and meaning {{that have nothing to do}} with antitrust (from industrial policy motives to privacy, copyright or media law arguments) and that, on the contrary, the Commission will devote its efforts to sharpening its understanding of dynamic competition in cyberspace, and the tools that should be applied in the analysis of these peculiar, fast-changing and often elusive settings...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{interface}} between {{intellectual property law}} and competition law is currently under review both in the US and the EU. One field of contention is the unilateral exercise of intellectual property rights. This paper presents the different approaches recently taken by different US courts, critically reviews the ECJ’s jurisprudence in the much-debated decisions Magill and IMS Health and discusses the test proposed by the EU Commission in its Discussion Paper on <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Abuses,</b> finding {{that none of the}} approaches has addressed the problem convincingly so far. In searching for a way ahead, the paper attempts to systematize the different positions taken in the literature, contrasting in particular an “IP law approach” and a “competition law approach”. It argues that a pure “IP law approach”, popular in the US, is not fully applicable in the EU where IP law remains national and must respect the supremacy of the EU competition rules which must be applied uniformly in all Member States. Other theories which strive to take both IP and competition law rationales into account – e. g. Heinemann’s “scope of reward”-theory – leave open the criteria on the basis of which this shall be done. The most promising approach, then, may be to shift back attention towards competition policy rationales and to focus on the concept of “contestable markets”, as by Heinemann and Drexl have recently proposed. The threshold for antitrust intervention must, however, remain high. The three criteria used in the telecommunications sector to decide when regulation is justified may be of help to determine cases of legitimate interventio...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the principles under Article 82 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community concerning anticompetitive or <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses</b> involving pricing issues. This Article is structured as follows. Part I outlines the basic economic thinking behind price discrimination and identifies the principal legal situations under Article 82 {{in which it}} arises. Discriminatory pricing should only be prohibited (and therefore needs to be justified) in {{a small number of}} situations. Parts II-III discuss the specific situations under Community competition law in which price discrimination and the legality of pricing practices may be relevant. Part II discusses rebate and discounting practices, including target (or sales growth) rebates, fidelity or loyalty rebates, and rebates in return for exclusivity. Part III discusses price discrimination that gives rise to distortions of competition between customers. This concerns Article 82 (c), a provision that has some parallels with the Robinson-Patman Act under U. S. law. In practice, it will be rare that a profit-maximizing firm will have the ability or incentive to charge different prices to comparable customers {{to such an extent that}} competition between those customers will be significantly distorted. Part IV discusses predatory pricing. It is important that prices that remain above average variable cost should nearly always be treated as legal, since rivals will usually be able, and should be encouraged, to compete in that scenario. Community competition law should only treat pricing above average variable cost as unlawful where there is evidence of other abusive behavior linked to that low pricing, in other words a clear plan to eliminate a rival by using a range of illicit practices. Part V discusses a specific instance of predatory pricing [...] cross-subsidization. Cross-subsidy cases are in essence cases in which the abuse, if there is one, is predatory pricing. Finally, the Conclusion summarizes the author 2 ̆ 7 s comprehension of what the correct principles under Community competition law concerning pricing practices should be...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{modernisation}} of the EC competition rules, the Commission published in December 2005 a « Discussion Paper » on the application of Article 82 EC to <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses,</b> calling for comments. This article considers the merits of the Discussion Paper and the scope for improvement. The principle emphasised in the Discussion Paper that an economic effects based approach should be taken to Article 82 EC is welcomed both for its realism and its greater coherency in relation to the approach taken under Article 81 EC and the merger regulation. The explicit recognition that competition law is there to protect consumers and not competitors and the adoption of an 'as effective competitor' test are also positive developments. Nonetheless, often in practice the Discussion Paper fails to translate this desire to reform into appropriate legal tests, often creating unjustified presumptions of dominance and abuse. In this regard, the possibility of presuming dominance on the basis of market shares alone, completely ignoring the dynamic nature of competition, appears particularly problematic. In the case of abuses, the Discussion Paper all too often creates presumptions based on irrelevant factors or conditions that are far too easily fulfilled (for example, the presumption of abuse in case of individualised quantitative rebates, even when these relate to an insignificant proportion of client requirements). Moreover, the defences are too rigid and narrowly defined, preventing economic efficiencies and commercial realities from being sufficiently taken into account. The wholesale transposal of the Article 81 (3) EC test to Article 82 EC is particularly regrettable, given that the conditions of indispensibility and absence of elimination of competition appear not to fit in with an analysis of dominant companies' behaviour. Although no rule is perfect, it must not be forgotten that false positives are just as damaging to competition as false negatives. Failure to take this into account will have the paradoxical effect that competition policy in Europe will chill competition rather than fostering it. Nonetheless, any shortcomings of the Discussion Paper do not detract from its merits. It can only be hoped that later drafts of the Discussion Paper and/or future guidelines build on this already solid base {{in the spirit of the}} reform :a fairer, more realistic and economic based approach to Article 82 EC.

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{interface}} between competition law and market integration, {{in the application of}} Article 102 TFEU. It focuses on ‘market separation’ and addresses conduct that has the intent, or effect, of hindering cross-border trade, either in the form of geographic price discrimination or in the form of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>abuses,</b> in which out-of-State competitors are affected. In doing so, the thesis delves into a comparative analysis of the Treaty requirements under Article 102 TFEU when applied in market separation cases and the Treaty requirements under the free movement provisions. It begins with a comparison of the objectives of the two sets of provisions and assesses how their historical link is echoed, presently, in the requirement of ‘effect on trade’ under Article 102 TFEU (Chapter I). Following this, the thesis explores the asymmetry as between the addressees of the two sets of provisions (Chapter II). It is argued that ‘undertaking with a dominant position’, as a distinct condition of the application of Article 102 TFEU, is the outer limit to any expansive view of direct horizontal applicability of the freedoms. Therefore, alleged market separation by dominant undertakings should be subject to Article 102 TFEU alone. Subsequently, the material scope of the prohibitions contained in the two sets of provisions is addressed. Here, it is argued that, {{in the vast majority of}} market separation cases, there is nothing special about {{the interface between}} competition law and the Internal Market. Rather, the inherent limits of economic integration, as reflected in the notion of trade barriers, should also be taken into account under the enforcement of Article 102 TFEU against dominant undertakings (Chapter III). Tensions between competition law and the Internal Market may, nevertheless, arise when non-economic values, as reflected in the notion of justified trade barriers, come into play. In these cases, the interface between competition law and the Internal Market is better conceptualised as a question of unclear attribution of the market distorting effect to the undertaking and/or the State (Chapter IV). A revised defence of shared responsibility for the market separation is proposed, which would render the legality of State intervention under the free movement provisions a necessary condition for the application of Article 102 TFEU against the dominant undertaking (Chapters V and VI). This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 28 May 2014 Examining Board: Professor Heike Schweitzer (supervisor), Freie Universität Berlin Professor Thomas Fetzer, University of Mannheim Professor Pierre Larouche, Tilburg University Professor Giorgio Monti, EUI. Received the The Institute of Competition Law 2015 Concurrences PhD Award. A {{margin squeeze}} is an <b>exclusionary</b> form of <b>abuse</b> of a {{dominant}} position that a vertically integrated firm can implement when it sells its upstream bottleneck input to its downstream competitors. Because it is vertically integrated, the dominant incumbent {{can reduce the}} margin between the input price charged to competitors and the retail price charged to end-users by either raising {{the price of the}} input and/or lowering the price of its retail product/services {{to such an extent that}} the remaining margin of profit is insufficient for its rivals to remain competitive. Although the scenario of margin squeeze seems to be rather simple, the underlying economic and legal theories are not. Consequently, detecting a margin squeeze requires competition authorities to apply a complex imputation test, which in turn requires various methodological choices that can determine the outcome of the investigation. The principal purpose of the dissertation is to determine whether the European Commission's margin squeeze decisions are consistent with EU case law. The dissertation examines two alternative hypotheses. Under hypothesis A, margin squeeze is presented as a deviation from the essential facilities doctrine, which could be seen as an expression of regulatory competition law. Hypothesis B assumes that it constitutes another form of vertical foreclosure, the main question then being under what exact conditions foreclosure is likely in network industries where the margin squeeze doctrine traditionally applies. Two conclusions follow from the analysis. First, margin squeeze constitutes another theory of vertical foreclosure, and accordingly cannot be seen as an unjustified deviation from refusal to deal and essential facilities cases. Second, to ensure that the theory of harm in margin squeeze cases is credible, competition authorities could enhance their current analytical framework by regularly reviewing various additional elements, in particular the extent to which the wholesale product is important for downstream competition...|$|R
