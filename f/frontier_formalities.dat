50|$|For {{most of its}} 5,798 {{m length}} the tunnel runs in a {{straight}} line, but incorporating a gentle slope. The northern end is 1918 m above sea level while the southern end is only 1875 m above sea level. At both ends, the approach road to the tunnel is covered by a gallery / avalanche shelter {{in order to minimize}} the risk of access to the tunnel being temporarily blocked during bad weather. Any <b>frontier</b> <b>formalities</b> are handled at the tunnel's north end, although the actual national frontier is 2938 m from the Swiss tunnel entrance and 2860 m from the Italian entrance.|$|E
5000|$|Economic affairs {{along the}} entire river were so bad that the League of Nations instituted in 1922 an inquiry by a special committee, headed by an American, Walker D. Hines (Wilson's wartime chief of railroads). His report was issued in August 1925, stating that the river fleet carried 25 percent more tonnage than before the war, but traffic was only 56 percent of normal. This {{reduction}} was largely due to an economic depression {{but also by the}} breakup of Austria-Hungary's large duty-free area. Hines scored the [...] "petty attitudes" [...] of the multitude of free governments and complained of the <b>frontier</b> <b>formalities</b> and the exclusion of non-nationals from international trade. Despite the existence of the EDC and the IDC, the situation had [...] "changed but little {{since the end of the}} war." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 (the false) Sonja Lüneburg {{was taken}} to West Germany, using an {{indirect}} route via Colmar in Alsace. For {{the next two years}} she lived in Hamburg where she had obtained work with an insurance company. [...] Outside office hours she was undergoing intense further training. She undertook several overseas foreign trips to London, Sweden and France, enabling her to gain a detailed knowledge of how <b>frontier</b> <b>formalities</b> worked. [...] She was still in Hamburg in 1969 when, on the urgent recommendation of her Stasi handler, she replied to a newspaper job advertisement for a secretarial job in Bonn - then the West German capital. [...] Her application was successful, and she found herself working, between 1969 and 1972, as secretary for William Borm, a FDP member of the West German parliament ("Bundestag"). [...] An irony of which neither of them was aware at the time was that Borm was also on the Stasi payroll.|$|E
50|$|The {{signing of}} the “interim {{agreement}} on mutual railway operations at the Prostřední Žleb-Bad Schandau border crossing” on 31 August 1947 was of crucial importance for Bad Schandau station. This agreement between the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD) and Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) provided that the handover of all cross-border trains would take place in Bad Schandau and so the station became a border station handling <b>frontier</b> and customs <b>formalities</b> for cross-border freight and passenger traffic.|$|R
