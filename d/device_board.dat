50|$|The rolling {{methods can}} only be used on a {{casualty}} {{who does not have}} an unstable trauma. They are especially helpful for heavy weighted casualties: the rolling does not require much effort, and the lifting itself is done in a more comfortable position (the back of the first responders is vertical). They are also interesting when the casualty is in a very narrow place such as a pit or a ditch: the rolling allows sliding the lifting <b>device</b> (<b>board,</b> flexible stretcher, halves of the scoop stretcher).|$|E
5000|$|Although JTAG's early {{applications}} targeted board level testing, the JTAG {{standard was}} designed to assist with <b>device,</b> <b>board,</b> and system testing, diagnosis, and fault isolation. Today JTAG is used as the primary means of accessing sub-blocks of integrated circuits, making it an essential mechanism for debugging embedded systems which may not have any other debug-capable communications channel. On most systems, JTAG-based debugging {{is available from the}} very first instruction after CPU reset, letting it assist with development of early boot software which runs before anything is set up. An in-circuit emulator (or, more correctly, a [...] "JTAG adapter") uses JTAG as the transport mechanism to access on-chip debug modules inside the target CPU. Those modules let software developers debug the software of an embedded system directly at the machine instruction level when needed, or (more typically) in terms of high level language source code.|$|E

Here we are to interface the A/C devices like BULB,FAN, etc with the smart phone. We need to design an android application which would be interfaced with the GSM device placed on the kit. According to the button pressed on the app a coded message will be generated. The coded message will {{vary according to the}} button pressed. So the coded message will be transmitted to the kit with air as the medium, i. e., GSM. The transmitted message will be received by the other GSM modem placed at the <b>device</b> <b>board.</b> According to the message received, controller is going to control the devices.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an improved approach based on a novel non-intrusive method for easily assess the high frequency CW EM radiated susceptibility of an electronic system by characterizing its non-linear electromagnetic-effects. For this purpose, we have developed a specific harmonic frequency detection system coupled with a mode stirrer reverberating chamber. We describe the principles of the method, and we study a generic <b>device</b> <b>board</b> which is representative of a real electronic system. We evaluate the EM susceptibility of a micro controller in full functional mode and the data exchanges with two types of external 8 Mb SRAM memories. We observe the EM radiated susceptibility of this device by a functional EMC analysis method; then we measure the harmonic frequency content and make a correlation with the EM susceptibility results. We obtain significant differences between the two memory devices, as a consequence of their different management of internal voltage over stress. We are well aware that this method is currently not validated in industrial environments EMC. In this paper, we only wanted to show that the appearance of the highest harmonic level occurs only when that DUT has the highest functional failure...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of vibrations on the material of the board. For that purpose a cascade of navigation <b>devices</b> <b>boards</b> was installed on the vibrational stand. Experiments were performed in the 0, 5 â€“ 10 Hz vibrational diapason range; 0 â€“ 3 V voltage range; 0 â€“ + 45 Â° C allowed temperature range. Amplitude method was applied to determine the coordinates of localized sources of acoustic emission. The results indicate the initial increase in tension and relative deformation and further their decrement. Growth rate reduction of mechanical stress dÏƒ/dÎµ is due to destruction of material structure. The receiving piezo converter based on Ð¦Ð¢Ð¡- 19 ceramics and a waveguide that was in acoustic contact with the sample were used during experiments. The acquired experimental data on acoustic emission reflect the formation of microdefects and the instability of mechanical tension, its avalanche and explosive tendency in the material when the microvolumes of material are torn. </p...|$|R
