25|$|The daggernose shark poses little {{danger to}} humans {{due to its}} small size and teeth. This shark is caught in small numbers by {{subsistence}} fishers in Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana. It also comprises about one-tenth of the catch of a northern Brazil <b>floating</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishery targeting Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) and Acoupa weakfish (Cynoscion acoupa), which operates in estuaries during the dry season. This shark is often found in markets, but is not highly regarded as a food fish. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Critically Endangered, as it has a limited distribution and is highly susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate. The daggernose shark has declined over 90% {{over the past decade}} off Brazil, and similar declines have likely also occurred elsewhere in its range as fishing pressure in the region continues to grow more intense. The IUCN has urgently recommended the implementation of conservation schemes and the expansion of fishery monitoring for this species. Evidence also points to this species being on the verge of or already in reproductive collapse.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored and <b>floating</b> <b>gillnets,</b> beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast fishing on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|R
40|$|Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{proposes to}} amend the {{regulations}} implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP), to revise the management measures for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in commercial fisheries to meet {{the goals of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). NMFS proposes additional regulations for the fisheries currently covered by the ALWTRP, which include the Northeast sink gillnet, Northeast/ Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot, U. S. Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U. S. Atlantic shark gillnet fisheries. NMFS also proposes to regulate the following fisheries from the MMPA’s List of Fisheries for the first time under the ALWTRP: Northeast anchored <b>float</b> <b>gillnet,</b> Northeast drift gillnet, Atlantic blue crab, and Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fisheries targeting crab (red, Jonah, and rock), hagfish, finfish (black sea bass, scup, tautog, cod, haddock, pollock, redfish (ocean perch), and white hake), conch/ whelk, and shrimp.

40|$|SUMMARY: NMFS issues {{this final}} rule {{to amend the}} {{regulations}} implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP). This final rule revises the management measures for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to the Northern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in commercial fisheries to meet {{the goals of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The measures identified in the ALWTRP are also intended to benefit minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which are not strategic, but are known to be taken incidentally in commercial fisheries. This final rule implements additional regulations for the fisheries currently covered by the ALWTRP (the Northeast sink gillnet, Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot, Mid-Atlantic gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U. S. Atlantic shark gillnet fisheries) and regulates several fisheries from the MMPA List of Fisheries for the first time under the ALWTRP, including the following: Northeast anchored <b>float</b> <b>gillnet,</b> Northeast drift gillnet, Atlantic blue crab, and Atlantic mixed species trap/pot fisheries targeting crab (red, Jonah, and rock), hagfish, finfish (black sea bass, scup, tautog, cod, haddock, pollock, redfish (ocean perch), and white hake), conch/whelk, and shrimp. DATES: The amendments to § § 229. 2, 229. 3, and 648. 264 (a) (6) (i) are effectiv...|$|R
25|$|The spadenose shark is {{harmless}} to humans. This common {{species is}} taken by artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range, using <b>floating</b> and fixed <b>gillnets,</b> longlines, bottom nets, fish traps, trawls, and hook-and-line. The meat is eaten or used as bait for other fishes, the fins are valued for shark fin soup, and the carcasses are processed into fishmeal. The meat {{can also be}} processed with glacial acetic acid to obtain a gel powder {{that can be used}} as a protein supplement in cereal foods, a biodegradable film for wrapping seafood, or a binder in sausages and other foods.|$|R
25|$|Nylon {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to abrasion and degradation, hence the netting {{has the potential}} to last for many years if it is not recovered. This ghost fishing is of environmental concern. Attaching the <b>gillnet</b> <b>floats</b> with biodegradable material can reduce the problem. However it is difficult to generalize about the longevity of ghost-fishing gillnets due to the varying environments in which they are used. Some researchers have found gill-nets still catching fish and crustaceans over a year after loss, while others have found lost nets destroyed by wave action within one month or overgrown with seaweeds, increasing their visibility and reducing their catching potential {{to such an extent that}} they became a microhabitat used by small fish.|$|R
