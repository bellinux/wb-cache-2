5|$|He {{was a most}} {{delightful}} man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E
5|$|If I {{have one}} day off I {{would want to}} come back and say goodbye because to the fans <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> a big thank you because they were always good to me.|$|E
5|$|The moral {{systems of}} religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our {{kids in a}} {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>owed</b> it {{to myself}} to {{consider}} the chances against me before I confronted them. <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> it to my wife {{to do all that}} lay in my power to lessen the risk.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>owed</b> Cohn a lot - <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> him {{my whole}} career. So I had respect for him, {{and a certain}} amount of love. Despite his crudeness and {{everything}} else, he gave me my chance. He took a gamble on me.|$|R
5000|$|Jill Lawler: “I felt so disgusting, but I {{just did}} {{what he told me}} to do, which was basically, like, {{manually}} jerk him off. I hated doing it. But I felt like <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> him, you know? I felt like <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> him for, like, my life.” ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Beasley, even if <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> you that, {{how could}} I raise so {{enormous}} a sum? <b>I</b> don't <b>owe</b> it. And <b>I</b> certainly won't {{be put off}} my property. You can't put me off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{feeling that}} I {{was doing my}} duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged me to be secret. <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which {{it could not be}} in my power to satisfy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Conceal, my lord?--that {{is hardly}} fair, {{considering}} that I told you expressly I {{could not give}} you any idea what was the amount <b>I</b> <b>owed.</b> <b>I</b> concealed nothing; if you deceived yourself, the fault was not mine." ...|$|R
25|$|If I am alive today, <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> this to {{this great}} man. Furtwängler helped and {{protected}} {{a great number}} of Jewish musicians and this attitude shows a great deal of courage since he did it under the eyes of the Nazis, in Germany itself. History will be his judge.|$|E
25|$|Her {{debut album}} <b>I</b> <b>Owe</b> You was {{released}} on September 7, 2004. The 11-track set included production and songwriting from such luminaries as Rodney Jerkins, Warryn Campbell, Erica and Tina Campbell of Mary Mary, J Moss, and Tonéx. The album also functioned as the production debut for her brother J Drew.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>owe</b> {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E

5000|$|Burt Reynolds {{turned down}} the role of {{astronaut}} Garrett Breedlove in Terms of Endearment to do this film. The role went to Jack Nicholson, {{who went on to}} win an Academy Award. Reynolds said he made this decision because [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> Hal more than <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> Jim" [...] but that it was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. [...] "That's where I lost them," [...] he says of his fans.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>owe</b> {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
500|$|Welles {{credited}} Toland on {{the same}} title card as himself and said [...] "It's impossible {{to say how much}} <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> to Gregg. He was superb." [...] He called Toland [...] "the best director of photography that ever existed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say none at all, Bob, {{and you can}} wound no feeling, {{while you}} will tell the truth. My father died a {{lieutenant-colonel}} when I was a school-boy; <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> my ensigncy to my uncle Sir Hugh, {{the father of the}} present Sir Harry Willoughby; after that <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> each step to hard and long service. Your mother's legacies have helped you along, at a faster rate, though I do trust there has been some merit to aid in the preferment." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland laughed softly. [...] "Well, {{perhaps that}} was the reason, though I would sooner believe it was because I {{recognised}} what <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> the State." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> it;--she {{suffered}} {{more than}} this seeing her baby die;--I thought of you in her place, and I could not help doing it." ...|$|R
500|$|Diệm went on {{to answer}} a {{question}} about his religious convictions by declaring his adherence to Catholicism and saying [...] "I have always found the principles of my religion a great inspiration, and, if I have achieved anything in my political career, <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> it all to those principles". His comments were widely trumpeted in Catholic newspapers, which cited it as the reason why he was able to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|In 1790, Ernest {{asked his}} father for {{permission}} to train with Prussian forces. Instead, in January 1791, he and Prince Adolphus were sent to Hanover to receive military training {{under the supervision of}} Field Marshal Wilhelm von Freytag. Before leaving Göttingen, Ernest penned a formal letter of thanks to the university, and wrote to his father, [...] "I should {{be one of the most}} ungrateful of men if ever I was forgetful of all <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> to Göttingen & its professors." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Second World War Allingham {{continued}} to work for Ford until he retired in 1960. After Denis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association tracked him down in 2001, Allingham took {{a prominent role in}} telling his story so that later generations would not forget. On 16 October 2003, he helped launch [...] the 2003 Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal with model Nell McAndrew aboard the cruiser [...] He was quoted as saying [...] " [...] have given all they have got for the country ... <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> them ... we all owe them." ...|$|E

500|$|When The Shooting Star {{appeared}} in Le Soir, Hergé featured a gag {{in which two}} Jews hear the prophetic news {{that the end of}} the world is near. They rub their hands together in eagerness, and one comments: [...] "Did you hear, Isaac? The end of the world! What if it's true?" [...] The other responds: [...] "Hey, hey, it vould be a gut ding, Solomon! <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> my suppliers 50,000 francs, and zis way I von't haf to pay vem!" [...] Hergé omitted this scene from the collected edition.|$|E
500|$|McCain finally {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy on September 27, 1999 before {{a thousand people}} in Greeley Park in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying [...] "It is because <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> America more than she has ever owed me that I am {{a candidate for president}} to the United States." [...] He further said he was staging [...] "a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve." [...] As originally planned, he began his announcement day with a visit to the Naval Academy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the eight}} days {{following}} the announcement, the page operated as it normally did. After reconsidering several times, the administrator decided to keep maintaining the page, and thanked the media and his followers for supporting him. He concluded by saying, [...] "I am not sure if keeping this page will benefit the people of goodwill ... only God will know if I was irresponsible or stubborn in doing so ... On another note, I confess {{that it has been}} an honor and pleasure to continue collaborating and working as a team with all of you. Thank you, people of goodwill from Tamaulipas. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> it all to you." ...|$|E
