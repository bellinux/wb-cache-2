500|$|Orban {{told the}} Committee that the {{multilingual}} {{dimension of the}} EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes {{and should not be}} seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E

This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S.

[...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year.
