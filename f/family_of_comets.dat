60|$|Further {{significant}} {{evidence is}} furnished by the comets of short periods. Of the thirteen constituting this group, twelve have orbits falling between those of Mars and Jupiter: one only having its aphelion beyond {{the orbit of}} Jupiter. That is to say, {{nearly all of them}} frequent the same region as the planetoids. By implication, they are similarly associated in respect of their periods. The periods of the planetoids range from 3.1 to 8.8 years; and all these twelve comets have periods falling between these extremes: the least being 3.29 and the greatest 8.86. Once more this <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> like the planetoids in the zone they occupy and like them in their periods, are like them also in the respect that, as Mr. Lynn has pointed out, their motions are all direct. How happens this close kinship--how happens there to be this <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> so much like the planetoids and so much like one another, but so unlike comets at large? The obvious suggestion is that they are among the products of the explosion which originated the planetoids, the aerolites, and the streams of meteors; and consideration of the probable circumstances shows us that such products might be expected. If the hypothetical planet was like its neighbour Jupiter in having an atmosphere, or like its neighbour Mars in having water on its surface, or like both in these respects; then these superficial masses of liquid, of vapour, and of gas, blown into space along with the solid matters, would yield the materials for comets. There would result, too, comets unlike one another in constitution. If a fissure opened beneath one of the seas, the molten metals and metallic gases rushing through it as above described, would decompose part of the water carried with them; and the oxygen and hydrogen liberated would be mingled with undecomposed vapour. In other cases, portions of the atmosphere might be propelled, probably with portions of vapour; and in yet other cases masses of water alone. Severally subject to great heat at perihelion, these would behave more or less differently. Once more, it would ordinarily happen that detached swarms of meteors projected as implied, would carry with them masses of vapours and gases; whence would result the cometic constitution now insisted on. And sometimes there would be like accompaniments to meteoric streams.|$|E
6000|$|See, then, the {{contrast}} between the two hypotheses. That of Laplace, looking probable while there were only four planetoids, but decreasing in apparent likelihood as the planetoids increase in number, until, as they pass through the hundreds {{on their way to the}} thousands, it becomes obviously improbable, is, at the same time, otherwise objectionable. It pre-supposes a nebulous ring of a width so enormous that it would have overlapped the ring of Mars. This ring would have had differences between the angular velocities of its parts quite inconsistent with the Nebular Hypothesis. The average eccentricities of the orbits of its parts must have differed greatly from those of adjacent orbits; and the average inclinations of the orbits of its parts must similarly have differed greatly from those of adjacent orbits. Once more, the orbits of its parts, confusedly interspersed, must have had varieties of eccentricity and inclination unaccountable in portions of the same nebulous ring; and, during concentration into planetoids, each must have had to maintain its course while struggling through the assemblage of other small nebulous masses, severally moving in ways unlike its own. On the other hand, the hypothesis of an exploded planet is supported by every increase in the number of planetoids discovered; by the greater numbers of the smaller sizes; by the thicker clustering near the inferred place of the missing planet; by the occurrence of the greatest mean distances among the smallest members of the assemblage; by the occurrence of the greatest eccentricities in the orbits of these smallest members; and by the entanglement of all the orbits. Further support for the hypothesis is yielded by aerolites, so various in their kinds, but all suggestive of a planet's crust; by the streams of shooting stars having their radiant points variously placed in the heavens; and also by the solitary shooting stars visible to the naked eye, and the more numerous ones visible through telescopes. Once more, it harmonizes with the discovery of a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> twelve out of thirteen of which have mean distances falling within the zone of the planetoids, have similarly associated periods, have all the same direct motions, and are connected with swarms of meteors and with meteoric streams. May we not, indeed, say, that if there once existed a planet between Mars and Jupiter which burst, the explosion must have produced just such clusters of bodies and classes of phenomena as we actually find? ...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{observations}} from decimetric to submillimetric wavelengths {{are now a}} basic tool for the investigation <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> Spectroscopic observations allow us i) to monitor the gas production rate <b>of</b> the <b>comets,</b> by directly observing the water molecule, or by observing secondary products (e. g., the OH radical) or minor species (e. g., HCN); ii) to investigate the chemical composition of comets; iii) to probe the physical conditions of cometary atmospheres: kinetic temperature and expansion velocity. Continuum observations probe large-size dust particles and (for the largest objects) cometary nuclei. Comets are classified from their orbital characteristics into two separate classes: i) nearly-isotropic, mainly long-period comets and ii) ecliptic, short-period comets, the so-called Jupiter-family comets. These two classes apparently come from two different reservoirs, respectively the Oort cloud and the trans-Neptunian scattered disc. Due to their different history and — possibly — their different origin, they may have different chemical and physical properties that are worth being investigated. The present article reviews the contribution of radio observations to our knowledge <b>of</b> the Jupiter-family <b>comets</b> (JFCs). The difficulty of such a study is the commonly low gas and dust productions <b>of</b> these <b>comets.</b> Long-period, nearly-isotropic comets from the Oort cloud are better known from Earth-based observations. On the other hand, Jupiter-family comets are more easily accessed by space missions. However, unique opportunities to observe Jupiter-family comets are offered when these objects come by chance close to the Earth (like 73 P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 in 2006), or when they exhibit unexpected outbursts (as did 17 P/Holmes in 2007). About a dozen JFCs were successfully observed by radio techniques up to now. Four to ten molecules were detected in five of them.

40|$|Papers on the {{environment}} <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> are presented, covering topics such as constraints on the interstellar dust model <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> dust, dust particles and <b>comet</b> nuclei, models <b>of</b> cometary nuclei, subliming gas in the near-nuclear layer <b>of</b> the <b>comet</b> coma, the nucleus and rotation <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Halley, the surface albedo <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> nuclei, observational studies on Comet Halley, comet simulations, comet ion composition, and chemical abundances in comets. Additional topics include the O 1 D and H 2 O production rate from comets, collisional coma models, the gas coma <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Giacobini-Zinner, IR properties <b>of</b> rough <b>comet</b> grains, studies <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Halley by Giotto, the impact of large dust particles on the Vega spacecraft, and carbonaceous materials as components <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> dust. Also, consideration is given to comet plasma boundaries, the comet ionopause, the solar wind-comet interaction, MHD turbulence and particle acceleration in a mass-loaded solar wind, combined first and second order Fermi acceleration at comets, discrete wave packets upstream from the earth and comets, and the visual appearance <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> under varying solar wind conditions...|$|R
40|$|Incontrovertible {{evidence}} for neutral H 2 O as an abundant volatile species in any comet contained in near-infrared airborne spectra <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Halley is discussed. The airborne spectra are compared with previous infrared studies <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> {{and with other}} investigations <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> Halley. The airborne measurements establish criteria for evaluating the spectroscopic sensitivities of future studies <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> with remote infrared methods...|$|R
