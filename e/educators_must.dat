50|$|Adult {{learners}} {{tend to be}} {{very practical}} learners. That is, they wish to see the application of their learning almost immediately.

50|$|In Chapter 6, Dewey {{maintains}} that students must {{feel a sense}} of purpose in their learning to avoid mental slavery. Dewey describes a slave as someone who “executes the purpose of another or is enslaved to his own blind desires.” A genuine purpose consists of impulses, desires that are measured against perceived consequences. A purpose involves thinking about future consequences resulting from acting upon impulse. Schooling should not just concern itself with appealing to a student’s desires or impulses. <b>Educators</b> <b>must</b> help students foresee the consequences of enacted impulses and desires. More importantly <b>educators</b> <b>must</b> help drive the direction of the purpose. The formation of purposes involves: observation of objective conditions; an assessment of past experiences with similar conditions; and judgment of observation combined with memory to determine significance.|$|E
40|$|Focus {{on some of}} the {{problems}} of culturally different groups is the purpose of this paper; also, some implications are drawn for the adult educator. These problems are basically problems of communication caused by the apartness of these groups from the dominant society. The communication process is defined as involving an exchange of meaning between the sender (Encoder) of a message and the receiver (Decoder). In three studies, researchers set out to identify personality traits common to culturally different groups and to describe relationships between them and the dominant society. Bases of difference include different value systems and attitudes springing from social, economic and other forces operating in the environment. Other impediments to communication arise from differences in language. Some implications of these communication problems for the adult educator are: (1) The adult <b>educator</b> <b>must</b> involve these groups in the program planning process; (2) He must learn to respect the difference in language; and (3) The adult <b>educator</b> <b>must</b> enlist the aid of sophisticated members of the different groups in the planning process of any program.

40|$|The {{considerations}} and reflections referred {{in this article}} are results of a qualitative approach research, as a study case, done with 15 professors who teach at a college in the city of Curitiba where majors for technologists are developed, and it also aimed at identifying the teaching methodology adopted by the educators in their pedagogical practice, and if there is any investment on their continuous education, having in mind the educational obstacles educators have been facing in this new century. In the discussions, the investigating process took into account the challenges demanded by the adoption of an innovative, dialogical and cooperative educational attitude which, in a participative and critical manner, needs the adoption of strategies that stimulate the creativity, construction and reconstruction of meaningful knowledge. In that innovative context, the <b>educator</b> <b>must</b> consider the social, political and economic practice. Thus, the <b>educator</b> <b>must</b> adopt a new complexity paradigm (MORIN, 2000, 2001, 2009), in which the educational and methodological process require a proactive attitude in the sense of investing in his/her continuous professional development, {{especially when it comes to}} pedagogical practice, using technological resources in the benefit of a collaborative and mediating educational action...|$|R

The name refers to the metaphor of students as containers into which <b>educators</b> <b>must</b> put knowledge.

30|$|Cooperative Learning {{can be used}} as an {{empowering}} methodology, in a way {{wherein the}} ones involved can learn by teaching their peers and being taught simultaneously. These exchanges enable a kind of learning through social relationships, motivated by collaborative bonds.

Teaching would be more than simple training once the <b>educator</b> <b>must</b> stimulate students’ criticism and willingness to learn.|$|R

Gradually, as the dance between the educator and child becomes smooth and familiar, the educator can encourage the child to try out more complex steps and learn how to dance to new compositions, beats, and tempos different from those known before. The dance partnership can also widen as both child and adult try out new partners from the larger group. As the child alternates between dancing sometimes with one or two partners and sometimes with many, the dance becomes a story about who the child has been and who the child is becoming, a reciprocal self created through close relationships...|$|R
