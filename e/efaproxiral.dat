50|$|<b>Efaproxiral</b> (INN) is an {{analogue}} of the cholesterol drug bezafibrate {{developed for}} the treatment of depression, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypoxia, sickle cell disease, hypercholesterolemia and as a radio sensitiser. The chemical is a propanoic acid in the class of amphipathic carboxylic acids. Most propanoic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. One use for <b>efaproxiral</b> is to increase the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs which have reduced efficacy against hypoxic tumours, and can thus be made more effective by increased offloading of oxygen into the tumour tissues. No benefit was seen for <b>efaproxiral</b> in phase III clinical trials. The increased oxygenation of tissues could theoretically also produce enhanced exercise capacity in feline, rat and canine models for approximately 100 min. immediately after a high dosage 45 min. intravenous infusion. This has led World Anti-Doping Agency to categorise <b>efaproxiral</b> under a prohibited method to artificially enhance the uptake, transport or delivery of oxygen. There is no existing evidence that <b>efaproxiral</b> can effectively enhance performance in humans. <b>Efaproxiral</b> can be absorbed via transdermal, rectal, inhalation and gastrointestinal routes, though not at plasma concentrations great enough to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. <b>Efaproxiral</b> is explicitly excluded from the 2012 World Anti-Doping Agency list of Prohibited Substances and is explicitly included in the Prohibited Methods section M1 as a forbidden procedure to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve in order to allosterically modify haemoglobin.|$|E

This analysis evaluated the Phase 3, Radiation Enhancing Allosteric Compound for Hypoxic Brain Metastases; RT- 009 (REACH) study efficacy results {{in relation to}} <b>efaproxiral</b> exposure (<b>efaproxiral</b> red blood cell concentration (E-RBC) and number of doses). Recursive partitioning analysis Class I or II patients with brain metastases from solid tumours received standard whole-brain radiation therapy (3 [*]Gy/fraction × 10 days), plus supplemental O 2 (4 [*]l/min), either with <b>efaproxiral</b> (75 or 100 [*]mg/kg daily) or without (control). <b>Efaproxiral</b> red blood cell concentrations were linearly extrapolated to all <b>efaproxiral</b> doses received. Three patient populations were analysed: (1) all eligible, (2) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as primary cancer, and (3) breast cancer primary. Efficacy endpoints were survival and response rate. Brain metastases patients achieving sufficient E-RBC (⩾ 483 [*]μg/ml) and receiving at least seven of 10 <b>efaproxiral</b> doses {{were most likely to}} experience survival and response benefits. Patients with breast cancer primary tumours generally achieved the target <b>efaproxiral</b> exposure and therefore gained greater benefit from <b>efaproxiral</b> treatment than NSCLC patients. This analysis defined the <b>efaproxiral</b> concentration-dependence in survival and response rate improvement, and provided a clearer understanding of <b>efaproxiral</b> dosing requirements...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer that}} metastasizes {{to the central}} nervoussystem (CNS) {{is the second most}} common cause of {{malignant}} brain tumors and is associated with a poor prog-nosis. 1 With improved systemic treatment of breast cancer, the incidence of CNS metastases is increasing, likely due to the inability of many treatments to penetrate into the CNS. This allows control of metastases elsewhere, with the CNS a sanctuary for cancer cells. 2 Treatment options for CNS metastases include corticosteroids for symptomat-ic relief, whole brain radiation, and neurosurgery. This pa-per focuses on the use of <b>efaproxiral</b> to enhance radiation therapy (RT) in brain tumors from metastatic breast cancer. <b>Efaproxiral</b> (Efaproxyn, Allos Therapeutics, Westmin-ster, CO; also known as RSR 13) is a synthetic allosteric modifier of hemoglobin. Allosteric modifiers shift the oxy-gen dissociation curve of hemoglobin to the right, which re-sults in oxygen that is less tightly bound to hemoglobin; therefore, oxygen is more readily released into tissues. The chemical name of <b>efaproxiral</b> is 2 -(4 -{[3, 5 -dimethylanili-no) carbonyl]methyl} phenoxy) - 2 -methyl propionic acid] (Figure 1). The drug is not yet approved in the US or else-where, although it was granted orphan status in August 2004 for use as an adjunct to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer. A Phase III trial has been completed in 538 patients with brain metastases and demonstrated a benefit in pa-tients with brain metastases originating from breast cancer. 3 These results were submitted to the Food and Drug Ad-ministration for approval for this indication. The drug has been granted an approvable status pending results from...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with radiosensitizer in comparison with WBRT alone for patients with brain metastases in terms of overall survival, disease progression, response to treatment and adverse effects of treatment. Methods: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) was performed in order to compare WBRT with radiosensitizer for brain metastases and WBRT alone. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library databases, in addition to Trial registers, bibliographic databases, and recent issues of relevant journals were researched. Significant reports were reviewed by two reviewers independently. Results: A total of 8 RCTs, yielding 2317 patients were analyzed. Pooled results from this 8 RCTs of WBRT with radiosensitizer have not shown a meaningful improvement on overall survival compared to WBRT alone OR = 1. 03 (95 % CI 0. 84 – 1. 25, p = 0. 77). Also, {{there was no difference}} in local brain tumor response OR = 0. 8 (95 % CI 0. 5 – 1. 03) and brain tumor progression (OR = 1. 11, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 3) when the two arms were compared. Conclusion: Our data show that WBRT with the following radiosentizers (ionidamine, metronidazole, misonodazole, motexafin gadolinium, BUdr, <b>efaproxiral,</b> thalidomide), have not improved significatively the overall survival, local control and tumor response compared to WBRT alone for brain metastases. However, 2 of them, motexafin- gadolinium and <b>efaproxiral</b> have been shown in recent publications (lung and breast) to have positive action in lung and breast carcinoma brain metastases in association with WBRT...|$|E
40|$|What {{evidence}} is available regarding the emerging and investigational therapies {{for the treatment}} of metastatic brain tumors? Target population These recommendations apply to adults with brain metastases. Recommendations New radiation sensitizers Level 2 A subgroup analysis of a large prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested a prolongation of time to neurological progression with the early use of motexafin-gadolinium (MGd). Nonetheless this was not borne out in the overall study population and therefore an unequivocal recommendation to use the currently available radiation sensitizers, motexafin-gadolinium and <b>efaproxiral</b> (RSR 13) cannot be provided. Interstitial modalities There is no evidence to support the routine use of new or existing interstitial radiation, interstitial chemotherapy and or other interstitial modalities outside of approved clinical trials. New chemotherapeutic agents Level 2 Treatment of melanoma brain metastases with whole brain radiation therapy and temozolomide is reasonable based on one class II study. Level 3 Depending on individual circumstances there may be patients who benefit from the use of temozolomide or fotemustine in the therapy of their brain metastases. Molecular targeted agents Level 3 The use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors may be of use in the management of brain metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} of this phase II study were to determine survival, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 2, 4 -[[(3, 5 -dimethylani-lino) carbonyl]methyl]phenoxy]- 2 -methylpropionic acid (RSR 13, <b>efaproxiral)</b> 100 mg/kg per day administered with standard cranial radiotherapy (RT) for the treat-ment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RSR 13, a syn-thetic allosteric modifier of hemoglobin, is a radiation-enhancing agent that noncovalently binds to hemoglobin, reduces oxygen-binding affinity, and in-creases oxygen unloading to hypoxic tissue. Patients and Methods: Fifty patients with newly di-agnosed GBM (Karnofsky performance status> 60) were enrolled onto this multicenter phase II study. Patients received daily RSR 13 100 mg/kg intrave-nously infused for 30 minutes immediately before cra-nial RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions). Supplemental oxygen was given during RSR 13 infusion and continued {{until after the}} RT treatment was completed. RT was given within 30 minutes {{of the end of}} RSR 13 infusion. PK and PD determinations were performed. Results: The median survival for the RSR 13 -treated patients was 12. 3 months with 1 -year and 18 -month survival rates of 54 % and 24 %, respectively. Twenty-four percent of patients had greater than grade 2 toxicity, which was generally transient and self-limited. A significant PD effect on hemoglobin-oxygen binding affinity was demonstrated for most patients. Conclusion: RSR 13 (100 mg/kg) administered im-mediately before cranial RT is well tolerated and is pharmacodynamically active. Median survival in ex-cess of 1 year is favorable...|$|E
40|$|Hibernation in the Arctic ground Squirrel (AGS) is a regulated, {{adaptive}} {{response to}} arctic environmental conditions. Problem statement: Regional brain Blood Flow (rCBF) {{has been observed}} to increase dramatically during arousal in hibernators. However, the real time dynamic change in P t O 2 during arousal has not been studied, we hypothesized that P t O 2 is Interdependent of Tbrain and a key component in the arousal process. Approach: Simultaneous in vivo measurements of P t O 2 and brain temperature (T brain) in conjunction with oxygen consumption (V 02) were conducted in the striatum of non-sedated, non-anesthetized Arctic ground squirrels during spontaneous arousal from hibernation. Results: A dramatic fluctuation of brain tissue oxygen partial pressure (P t O 2) {{is associated with the}} complex phenomena of spontaneous arousal. In this study, we observed that: (1) a P t O 2 elevation precedes changes in T brain and V 02; (2) P t O 2 changes do not correlate with changes in V 02 during arousal and (3), endogenous O 2 shift from O 2 enriched blood to brain in hibernating AGS induces an arousal with the pharmaceutical chemical, <b>efaproxiral</b> (RSR- 13). Conclusion: The four turning points of P t O 2 appearing at different T brain during arousal suggest that changes in P t O 2 are Tbrain interdependent and support the concept that arousal from hibernation is complex process invoking different feedbacks...|$|E
