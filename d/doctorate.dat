5000|$|A {{distinction}} is drawn in the US between professional <b>doctorates</b> and [...] "doctor's degree - research/scholarship", {{with the latter}} being [...] "a Ph.D. or other doctor's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement." [...] Internationally, US professional <b>doctorates</b> (which, unlike research <b>doctorates,</b> are not defined as requiring work beyond the master's level) are not {{generally considered to be}} doctoral level qualifications. The classification of [...] "Doctor's degree - other" [...] also exists for <b>doctorates</b> that do not meet the definition of either professional <b>doctorates</b> or research <b>doctorates.</b>|$|R

By the end of the decade, professional <b>doctorates</b> could be found in the majority of the country's universities and {{in a wide range of}} subjects.

The article identifies 20 distinctive features that are common to the professional <b>doctorates</b> that together could reasonably be said to comprise 'professional doctorateness' at least as it is interpreted in English universities...|$|R

5000|$|The first <b>doctorates</b> {{were awarded}} {{in the mid}} twelfth century to {{recognise}} teachers (doctors) in mediaeval universities, either in civil law at the University of Bologna or in theology at the University of Paris.

These mediaeval <b>doctorates</b> remained, however, essentially teaching qualifications, with their major importance being the ius ubique docendi - the right to teach anywhere.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of <b>doctorates</b> of design has generated debate about appropriate doctoral curriculum and submission formats. In {{response to the}} professional and practice-oriented dimensions of design, doctoral programs including project work, reduced text requirements, and purported industry relevance have developed in several countries. Often recruiting a distinct student cohort, such <b>doctorates</b> are a significant phenomenon in the UK and Australia, while limited in number in North America. Compared to traditional PhD submissions such <b>doctorates</b> purport to address professional and practice values deemed important to design. However, the concept of <b>doctorates</b> addressing professional development, practice and creative project work is still contentious for many fields including design. This paper examines {{the use of the}} terms profession, practice, and project work in alternative <b>doctorates</b> of design in three countries – Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There is some discussion of the characteristics of these programs and the paper includes some examples of current and completed student projects in such <b>doctorates.</b> The paper concludes with some questions regarding the discourse of professionalism employed to describe <b>doctorates</b> of design...|$|R
