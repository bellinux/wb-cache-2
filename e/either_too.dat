5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} <b>either</b> <b>too</b> {{early in the season}} or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that <b>either</b> <b>too</b> much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E

50|$|Mitahara is a Sanskrit {{combination}} word, from Mita (मित, moderate) and Ahara (आहार, taking food, diet), {{which together}} mean moderate diet. In Yoga and other ancient texts, {{it represents a}} concept linking nutrition {{to the health of}} one’s body and mind. It is considered a yamas or self-restraint virtue in some schools of Indian traditions, where one refrains from <b>either</b> eating <b>too</b> much or eating too little quantity of food, and where one refrains from <b>either</b> eating <b>too</b> much or too little of certain qualities of food. Mitahara is synonymous with Mātrāśin (मात्राशिन्).|$|R

5|$|The {{whole of}} the South Circular is a red route, {{allocated}} to roads that together make up over 30% of traffic in London. This prohibits any stopping or loading. Some sections of the road through the borough of Lewisham have extensive bus lanes. Their appearance is controversial; a 2006 resident survey produced mixed results, with people believing there were <b>either</b> <b>too</b> many or not enough.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were <b>either</b> <b>too</b> battered or too distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Big Huge Games added {{multiple}} {{new features}} {{to the game}} during its development, {{in an attempt to}} fix issues with the original version. In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously <b>either</b> <b>too</b> weak or too strong, and so features were added to balance gameplay. One way they did this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E

5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from both sides were <b>either</b> <b>too</b> shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{humidity}} {{are essential for}} optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by <b>either</b> <b>too</b> {{much or too little}} light. Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A.vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is <b>either</b> <b>too</b> unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it <b>either</b> <b>too</b> extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{carburetor}} {{leaves a}} stable condition, the float {{is influenced by}} both gravity and inertia, resulting in inaccurate fuel metering {{and a reduction in}} engine performance as the air-fuel ratio changes, becoming <b>either</b> <b>too</b> lean or too rich for maximum engine performance, and in some cases, stopping the engine.|$|E
25|$|Visit Baltimore's CEO Noonan {{revealed}} {{that at least}} 30% of interested citywide conventions, conventions defined as requiring at least 1,200 hotel rooms at its peak night, skip over Baltimore for other cities due to the convention center being <b>either</b> <b>too</b> small or is already booked on the dates the interested conventions want reserved in Baltimore.|$|E
50|$|Glaucoma {{is thought}} to be caused by an {{increase}} in intraocular pressure. Pressure increases <b>either</b> when <b>too</b> much aqueous humor fluid is produced or by decreased aqueous humor outflow. The trabecular meshwork is responsible for most of the outflow of aqueous humor.|$|R
5000|$|For {{subsurface}} drip the irrigator cannot see {{the water}} that is applied.

50|$|When {{circadian}} cycles become disrupted (due <b>either</b> to <b>too</b> {{little light}} {{or too much}} light {{at the wrong time}} of day), melatonin is produced at disrupted times. This causes an individual to experience disrupted sleep patterns, which in turn causes numerous health issues to arise.|$|R
25|$|As the Inquisitor, players {{influence}} how to deploy agents and {{troops of the}} Inquisition through their primary advisers, which influences the rewards and time requirements of the effort undertaken. The various regions {{that make up the}} game world do not scale in level. They have a fixed level, which means players can be <b>either</b> <b>too</b> weak or strong for the enemies found in that region.|$|E
25|$|Uneven {{pigmentation}} of {{some sort}} affects most people, regardless of bioethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Apart from blood-related conditions such as jaundice, carotenosis, or argyria, skin pigmentation disorders generally occur because the body produces <b>either</b> <b>too</b> {{much or too little}} melanin.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} three months of 1919, no less than twelve {{different}} ambushes were planned on the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord French. In most cases the target failed to show, or was <b>either</b> <b>too</b> late or too early to suit his would-be assassins' designs. On one occasion Peadar Clancy and Dan Breen waited for two hours outside the door of the practice of Dr. James Ashe, a specialist on Merrion Square whom French occasionally visited.|$|E
