5|$|Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on {{the mining}} of nickel in the United States, {{and sought to}} promote its use in coinage. He was also highly {{influential}} in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable <b>in</b> <b>lots</b> of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Since {{fractional}} {{currency in}} three-cent denominations {{did not appear}} until late 1864, the cent was the only means then circulating of making change from the five-cent note, and came, in 1862 and 1863, to command a premium when sold <b>in</b> <b>lots,</b> of about 4%. The Philadelphia Mint tried {{to keep up with}} demand, limiting public purchases of cents to five dollars, and sending shipments to major cities. Despite these attempts, Mint Director James Pollock noted in his annual reports that cents were almost unobtainable, hoarded despite the fact that their metallic value remained less than one cent each. Numismatist Neil Carothers theorized that they were put aside by the public as the only circulating federal coinage, made of metal {{at a time when the}} public was forced to accept flimsy pieces of paper instead of silver and gold.|$|E

40|$|Aroclor 1254 is {{a widely}} studied {{commercial}} polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture which, by definition, contains 54 % chlorine by weight. Recent reports indicate substantial differences in the congener composition among Aroclor lots and hence their biologic effects. We designed the current study to compare the effects of two lots of Aroclor 1254 (lots 6024 and 124 - 191). We analyzed these two lots for PCB congeners, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs). We used previously established techniques for analyzing intracellular Ca 2 + buffering and protein kinase C (PKC) translocation to test their biologic activity in neuronal preparations. PCB congener-specific analysis indicated that ortho and non-ortho congeners <b>in</b> these two <b>lots</b> varied <b>in</b> their percent contribution. Among all congeners, the percentages of non-ortho congeners (PCBs 77, 81, 126, and 169) were higher <b>in</b> <b>lot</b> 6024 (2. 9 % of total) than <b>in</b> <b>lot</b> 124 - 191 (0. 02 % of total). We detected no dioxins <b>in</b> these two <b>lots</b> (< 2 ppb). Although there are some differences in the congener composition, total PCNs were similar in both lots: 171 ppm <b>in</b> <b>lot</b> 6024 and 155 ppm <b>in</b> <b>lot</b> 124 - 191.

However, the track was all lifted, stations demolished, signals and other equipment disposed of, and the rolling stock relocated to a variety of new locations.

Another group of tablets was purchased in Kish in the 1930s and of these it was asserted that they came from Jemdet Nasr, although this is unlikely due to stylistic differences between these tablets and those excavated at Jemdet Nasr in 1926. During the first regular excavation season in 1926, between 150 and 180 tablets were found in Mound B; the error margin resulting from gaps in the administration kept by the excavators.

500|$|Beginning in 1867, the new Mint Director, Henry Linderman, (Pollock had resigned) {{began to}} {{advocate}} for Congress to authorize redemption of surplus copper and bronze coinage. [...] Although the nickel could be redeemed <b>in</b> <b>lots</b> (permission granted in its authorizing act), there was no provision {{for the government to}} buy back the smaller coins, and with more being issued every year, there were too many small-value coins. Treasury officials insisted the government could not accept the pieces beyond their legal tender limits, even if what was being done was exchanging them for other currency. [...] Under Linderman, the Mint, without any legal authority, purchased $360,000 in bronze coins using three-cent pieces and nickels. [...] Still, millions of two-cent pieces accumulated in the hands of newspaper and transit companies, postmasters, and others who took small payments from the public, and there were complaints to Congress. [...] With the advent of the Grant administration, Pollock returned to office and opposed the redemption proposals. [...] Although he included Pollock's opinions as part of his annual report, Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell asked Congress to pass a redemption act, and it did so on March3, 1871, allowing for the redemption of minor coinage <b>in</b> <b>lots</b> of not less than $20. It also allowed the Treasury Secretary to discontinue the coinage of any piece redeemed in large numbers.
