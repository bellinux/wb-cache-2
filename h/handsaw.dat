500|$|Designed by {{architect}} Jerry McDevitt, {{the station}} has an arched vault ceiling that {{is meant to}} reflect the area's historic buildings. The platform level also makes extensive use of red and gray granite, matching the King County Courthouse and former Public Safety Building, and railings that resemble s and hanging lamps. Artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler created the station's two [...] "artifact clocks", which hang from the mezzanine {{at each end of}} the platform. The north mezzanine clock uses materials from modern construction, including granite, steel beams, and electrical wires; the south mezzanine clock incorporates artifacts found during construction dating back to the city's early history, including cobblestones, brick, and cast-iron pipes. Both clocks use various tools used during construction, including a <b>handsaw</b> and industrial-size tape measure, for the clock face's numerals.|$|E

Nathan used his grandfather's <b>handsaw</b> to remove Adrianne's head and arms and placed them in a garbage bag. The three teenagers ate lunch at McDonald's, then later disposed of the garbage bag at the Black Hawk State Historic Site.|$|E
50|$|<b>Handsaws</b> {{have been}} around for {{thousands}} of years. Egyptian hieroglyphics exist depicting ancient woodworkers sawing boards into pieces. Ancient bow saws have been found in Japan. The cut patterns on ancient boards may be observed sometimes to bear the unique cutting marks left by saw blades, particularly if the wood was not 'smoothed up' by some method. As for preservation of <b>handsaws,</b> twenty-four saws from eighteenth-century England are known to survive.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} comparing chain saws and <b>handsaws</b> {{in terms of}} their influence for roughness of laceration. There were tested six different kinds of chain saws and three <b>handsaws</b> which differ in technical specification, construction and used chain or blade.

60|$|We {{took a long}} {{afternoon}} walk, {{and soon}} found out that that exceedingly white town was built of blocks of white coral. Bermuda is a coral island, with a six-inch crust of soil on top of it, and every man has a quarry on his own premises. Everywhere you go you see square recesses cut into the hillsides, with perpendicular walls unmarred by crack or crevice, and perhaps you fancy that a house {{grew out of the}} ground there, and has been removed in a single piece from the mold. If you do, you err. But the material for a house has been quarried there. They cut right down through the coral, to any depth that is convenient--ten to twenty feet--and take it out in great square blocks. This cutting is done with a chisel that has a handle twelve or fifteen feet long, and is used as one uses a crowbar when he is drilling a hole, or a dasher when he is churning. Thus soft is this stone. Then with a common <b>handsaw</b> they saw the great blocks into handsome, huge bricks that are two feet long, a foot wide, and about six inches thick. These stand loosely piled during a month to harden; then the work of building begins.|$|E
50|$|These include: tape measures, sockets, ratchets, wrenches, squeeze tools (pliers, visegrips), screwdrivers, hammers, prybars, axes, <b>handsaws,</b> chisels, staple guns, hand sanders, gear wrenches, levels, chalk line, etc.|$|R
50|$|Saws {{can also}} be {{considered}} 'pull cut' or 'push cut'. Ancient Egyptian saws have been said to be pull cut. Modern European saws (and those in European-derived cultures like that of the United States) generally have 'push cut' <b>handsaws.</b> Japanese <b>handsaws</b> are usually pull-cut and are still used today. In the 1930s, the Kulibert-Stanley Tool Company popularized an inexpensive saw. Many woodworkers have various theories about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} pull vs. push, and even experts will disagree on these matters, including accuracy of cut, power available for cut, straightness of line, thinness of kerf (the slit in the wood that is made during cutting), etc.|$|R

60|$|One {{point in}} which he had vastly the {{advantage}} over his four-footed brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. As he possessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher's meat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table. His reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under one's very nostrils. There were flavours on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him--not in anger or retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation, and seeking to reduplicate an endless series of enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual: a tenderloin of beef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps adorned his board {{in the days of the}} elder Adams, would be remembered; while all the subsequent experience of our race, and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. The chief tragic event of the old man's life, so far as I could judge, was his mishap with a certain goose, which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago: a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough, that the carving-knife would make no impression on its carcase, and it could only be divided with an axe and <b>handsaw.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} same factors {{underlie}} comfort in using {{different kinds of}} hand tools (screwdrivers, paintbrushes and <b>handsaws).</b> The underlying factors of the hand tools are identified using principal components analysis. The relationships between comfort descriptors (i. e. statements in end-users' own words {{that are related to}} comfort) and comfort factors (i. e. groups of comfort descriptors) with comfort experience are calculated. It is concluded that the same factors (functionality, physical interaction adverse effects on skin and in soft tissues) underlie comfort in different kinds of hand tools, however their relative importance differed. Functionality and physical interaction are the most important factors of comfort in using screwdrivers and paintbrushes (beta 0. 73 and 0. 67, respectively) and functionality was {{the most important factor in}} using <b>handsaws</b> (beta 0. 72). Moreover, the most important comfort descriptors differ between different kinds of hand tools. 'Has a nice feeling handle' (beta 0. 27), 'fits the hand' (beta 0. 43) and 'offers a high task performance' (beta 0. 43) are the most important comfort descriptors in using screwdrivers, paintbrushes and <b>handsaws,</b> respectively. Moreover, similarities are seen: 'Fits the hand' is associated with comfort in all studied hand tools. The results are applied in a flow chart, which designers can use to address the appropriate comfort descriptors in the hand tool design process. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{relationship}} between objective measurements and subjective experienced comfort and discomfort in using <b>handsaws</b> was examined. Twelve carpenters evaluated five different <b>handsaws.</b> Objective measures of contact pressure (average pressure, pressure area and pressure-time (P-t) integral) in static and dynamic conditions, muscle activity (electromyography) of five muscles of the upper extremity, and productivity were obtained during a sawing task. Subjective comfort and discomfort were assessed using the comfort questionnaire for hand tools and a scale for local perceived discomfort (LPD). We {{did not find any}} relationship between muscle activity and comfort or discomfort. The P-t integral during the static measurement (beta=- 0. 24, p< 0. 01) was the best predictor of comfort and the pressure area during static measurement was the best predictor of LPD (beta= 0. 45, p< 0. 01). Additionally, productivity was highly correlated to comfort (beta= 0. 31, p< 0. 01) and discomfort (beta=- 0. 49, p< 0. 01). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|To {{prevent the}} body of the blade binding and for other {{enhancements}} to the cutting action, the teeth can be set (angled out) from the blade. Teeth can be set in several patterns: single-sided set, alternating set or a patterned set. Most Western and Asian <b>handsaws</b> use an alternating set, whereby a tooth is set the opposite direction from the preceding one. Specialized tools like veneer saws or flush-cut saws may be set only to one side. Some hacksaws and machine saw blades have patterned sets that may require specially designed saw sets to create.|$|R

30|$|We searched within aspen {{patches and}} along the patch {{boundaries}} for conifers with potential direct evidence of fire (e.g., fire scars, conifer death dates, and ring-width changes and injuries). Cross sections and partial cross sections were collected with <b>handsaws</b> from remnant conifer logs, living trees, and standing dead snags with intact outer rings. Increment cores were collected from potentially injured live conifers without basal scars. Potential evidence of fire injury included char, scars on the undersides of branches, elevated crown base height, and unilateral loss of branches. Fire scars were not collected at PIN due to the existing fire scar collection located within our study site (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1995).|$|R
50|$|This area, {{which had}} been {{surveyed}} into small farms in 1864, sold rapidly due to economic buoyancy and peak immigration during the early 1860s. To the initial parcel of 20 acres (portion 302) purchased from William Lovell in 1865, James added adjacent allotments from other vendors. Since land along much of the river was dense sub-tropical rainforest or vine scrub, the family had to clear sufficient farm land by felling and firing. On portion 299 (acquired by James Sinnamon in 1866), the family built a large split slab hut with earthen floor. In addition to using their government land orders totalling £216, the Sinnamons borrowed money for capital improvements, which was repaid within several years. By 1869 {{they were able to}} build the more commodious, <b>handsawn</b> timber house further up the hill, known as Beechwood (portion 302).|$|R

50|$|In 1862 Swedish Göran Fredrik Göransson founded Högbo Stål & Jernwerks AB, {{producing}} {{high quality}} steel using the Bessemer process. In 1866 company went into bankruptcy and was refunded as Sandviken Jernverks AB in 1868. With the new technology {{a number of new}} applications for steel wires were discovered, for instance it was perfect for producing fishing hooks. A fishing hook must be hard and strong but absolutely not brittle. In 1879 The Swedish national board of trade approved the use of the Fish and Hook trademark. Starting in 1886, Göran began the production of saw blades that were of that same {{high quality steel}}. The little fish surrounded by a hook that was registered as the official emblem of rolled steel for fishhooks was also used for the <b>handsaws,</b> to communicate these special properties and quality of the blades. Today all Bahco tools are branded with this logo.|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as planes, table knives, anvils, files, taps and dies, rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, <b>handsaws,</b> and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|R
50|$|Tree care is the {{application}} of arboricultural methods like pruning, trimming, and felling/thinning in built environments. Road verge, greenways, backyard and park woody vegetation {{are at the center}} of attention for the tree care industry. Landscape architecture and urban forestry also set high demands on professional tree care. High safety standards against the dangers of tree care have helped the industry evolve. Especially felling in space-limited environments poses significant risks: the vicinity of power or telephone lines, insufficient protective gear (against falling dead wood, chainsaw wounds, etc.) and narrow felling zones with endangered nearby buildings, parking cars, etc.. The required equipment and experience usually transcends private means and is often considered too costly as a permanent part of the public infrastructure. In singular cases, traditional tools like <b>handsaws</b> may suffice, but large-scale tree care usually calls for heavy machinery like cranes, bucket trucks,harvesters, and woodchippers.|$|R
