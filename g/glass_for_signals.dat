40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} results of test {{measurements}} aimed at determining the performance of 6 Li-doped <b>glass</b> scintillators <b>for</b> ultra-cold neutron detection. Investigations have mainly focused on {{the reduction of the}} gamma-ray sensitivity of the scintillators. The probability of gamma interaction has been considerably lowered using very thin <b>glasses.</b> <b>For</b> <b>signals</b> corresponding to full-energy deposition, a background count rate of 8 × 10 − 3 s− 1 was obtained for a shielded 0. 5 cm 3 GS 10 scintillator located near the PF 2 turbine at ILL. The neutron–gamma separation has further been improved using a stack with an 6 Li-depleted scintillator and an 6 Li-enriched one. Neutron captures leading to partial energy deposition (so-called “edge events”) have strongly been reduced resulting in a clear separation between the neutron and the gamma contributions...|$|R
40|$|Optical fibre {{amplifiers}} are key {{devices for}} increasing the transmission distance, speed and capacity of optical communication systems. We report on current worldwide progress {{in the development of}} <b>glass</b> fibre amplifiers <b>for</b> amplification in the 1. 3 micron transmission window. There are three candidates for a practical device for this application, all of which require a glass host which is not silica based. As a consequence, performance and application of these devices does not yet match that of the erbium doped fibre amplifier operating at 1. 55 microns. However, the majority of land-based optical fibre operates at wavelengths around 1300 nm therefore there remains considerable interest for a practical amplifier. Recent trends, such as the development of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems, has meant that fibre amplifiers must meet a variety of requirements. These include high gain, high output power, a low noise figure, a broad and flat gain spectrum, high reliability, low cost, and compactness. Candidates for a 1. 3 micron fibre amplifier include praseodymium doped fluoride (PDFA) or a similar device based on chalcogenide glasses, both of which have demonstrated amplification though not yet at practical levels; neodymium doped fluoride <b>glasses</b> <b>for</b> which <b>signal</b> gain is possible but severely limited by competing transitions; and dysprosium doped chalcogenide glasses, from which only fluorescent has been demonstrated. In this presentation we review progress in these three variations of the ubiquitous 1300 nm optical fibre amplifie...|$|R
40|$|The switch {{reported}} {{here for the}} first time was designed for an application in satellite based communications, where the requirements were for low actuation voltage, high isolation, good vibration and shock tolerance, and low power consumption. The functional requirement was for a single-pole, double throw (SPDT) switch. To satisfy the low voltage specification, thermal actuation was chosen, with mechanical latching to limit average power consumption. Thin-film microstrip transmission lines were fabricated on <b>glass</b> wafers <b>for</b> the <b>signal</b> path, while the actuators were fabricated in bonded silicon on insulator on a separate wafer, the final device being formed by bonding the two parts together. The SPDT functionality was achieved, the actuation voltage was 3 V, and although insertion loss in these first prototypes was excessive, RF isolation was better than 50 dB across the 1 – 6 GHz range. 1...|$|R
