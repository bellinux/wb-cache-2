The geometry of the four-wheel landing gear assembly consists {{of several of the}} fine details including the oleo-strut, two <b>diagonal</b> <b>struts,</b> a door, yokes/pin and a flat-plate simulating the wing surface. The computational results, obtained by using 13. 3 million grid points, are presented with an emphasis on the characteristics of the unsteadiness ensuing from different parts of the landing-gear assembly, including vortex shedding patterns and frequencies of dominant oscillations. The results show that the presence of the <b>diagonal</b> <b>struts</b> and the door significantly influence the flow field. Owing to the induced asymmetry, vortices are shed only from one of the rear wheels and not the other. Present computations also capture streamwise vortices originating from the upstream corners of the door...|$|R

50|$|The {{two seat}} unarmed B {{was built in}} 1915 for {{reconnaissance}} duties. It was an equal span, two bay biplane, with straight edged, constant chord wings mounted without stagger. Unusually, the wing spars were made from tubular steel. The wings had parallel pairs of interplane struts, the inner ones with additional <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> cross bracing, and bays laterally conventionally braced with diagonal flying wires. The lower wing was joined to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper wing supported over the fuselage {{on a pair of}} outward leaning N-form struts from the upper fuselage; a fully semi-circular cut-out in the upper trailing edge improved the pilot's upward vision.|$|E

5000|$|From 1938 {{the axle}} base was {{increased}} from 7,000 mm to 8,000 mm and the wagons {{equipped with a}} three-dimensional, <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> frame again. This stable design enabled {{a top speed of}} 90 km/h and, from 1943, the maximum load to be raised to 20 tons (secondary letter m). The other design innovations were driven by the requirements of the Wehrmacht. For example, the end walls, made entirely from steel, served simultaneously as gangways and, as with the [...] "SSla Köln" [...] (see above), the brakeman's cab was omitted in favour of a folding brakeman's platform. For strategic reasons the secondary letter r was not, at first, written on the broad-gauge-compatible vehicles. Almost 24,000 of these robust vehicles were built up to 1943.

50|$|The Super Pétrel is {{of mixed}} construction, though with much use of {{composite}} materials. The wings have tubular aluminium alloy spars combined with PVC foam ribs. The leading edges and wingtips are formed from glass fibre composite, with fabric covering elsewhere. The wings have constant chord and zero sweep, with angled winglet tips; the upper wing has the greater span, less dihedral (2° 13′ compared with 3° 26′). There is slight stagger.

40|$|Steel frames with {{reinforced}} concrete infill walls (SRCW) are hybrid systems included in Eurocode 8 where their seismic design {{is based on}} the assumption that the lateral vertical steel elements and at the vertical reinforcements of the infill wall are the dissipative elements. In reality, the behaviour of such hybrid systems might be very different and characterised by a resisting system in which <b>diagonal</b> <b>struts</b> form within the {{reinforced concrete}} infills. As a consequence, such systems might exhibit problems at the beam-to-column connections and concrete crushing at a the diagonal bands. Furthermore, doubts arise about the behaviour in traction of the shear connectors and the anchorage of reinforcements. For these reasons, an innovative hybrid solution is proposed, conceived to ensure the formation of <b>diagonal</b> <b>struts</b> in the infill walls by eliminating the connectors of the wall to the vertical columns and by suitably placing stiffeners and bearing plates in the joints. The energy dissipation is supposed to take place mainly in the vertical steel elements without involving the reinforcements of the infill walls, allowing also their replaceability. Numerical and experimental tests are illustrated and discussed in order to present the capabilities of the proposed steel-concrete hybrid system...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the seismic capacity of existing reinforced concrete (R/C) building was developed by implementing a <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> model for considering brick infill effects. In this model, the strut width {{is presented as a}} function of frame-infill contact length, which was evaluated by static equilibriums related to compression balance and lateral displacement compatibility at the frame-infill interfaces. The lateral strength and stiffness of infill were obtained based on the strut width. The strut model has been verified through comparison with experimental results of a brick masonry infilled R/C frame. Good agreements were observed between the experimental and analytical performance on the lateral strength and ductility of the infill. Consequently, the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> model can be an effective tool for precisely screening earthquake-vulnerable existing R/C buildings in Padang city. In this study, two calculations of seismic capacity of two stories existing R/C building, without and with considering brick infill effects, were conducted by applying the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> model. However, the seismic capacity of R/C building without infill effect was evaluated based on Japanese standard. Consequently, it reveals that the brick infill significantly affected the seismic resistances of the investigated building...|$|E
40|$|The current American Concrete Institute code {{states that}} the nominal shear {{strength}} V n of a reinforced concrete deep beam consists of the concrete contribution V c and shear reinforcement contribution V s, i. e., V n=V c+V s. In this paper, however, a very different yet original approach is presented. The method is based on strut-and-tie approach, with the effect of transverse tensile stresses on concrete compressive strength of the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> properly accounted for. Two common failure modes, namely, diagonal splitting and concrete crushing, are examined in the paper. Premature failures such as shear tension failure (due to insufficient anchorage of main longitudinal reinforcement) and bearing failures are not considered. The resistance to diagonal splitting is mainly provided by the main and shear reinforcement. Additional resistance from concrete tensile strength {{is included in the}} analysis. The resistance to crushing of concrete is contributed by the concrete compressive strength. Ultimate shear strengths of deep beams are governed by both the transverse tensile stresses perpendicular to the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut,</b> and the compressive stresses in the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut,</b> resulting in an interaction between the two failure modes. Predictions by the proposed modal are compared with experimental results and other established calculation methods. Generally, the predictions are not only accurate and consistent in each case study, but also conservative. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{the suitability of}} using macro model (strut model) for analyzing the seismic responses of single-story single-span reinforced concrete frames having different arrangement of masonry infill wall with openings by compar-ing its results with those using micro model (wall-element model). From the result, the infill masonry wall increases the stiffness of RC frame structure. Meanwhile, the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> model will give smaller natural frequencies than wall-element model. When {{the part of the}} wall opening causes the wall to have no contact with a column, short column effect will be introduced in the column. Wall-element model can predict better the short column effect than the strut model.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, a macro {{finite element model}} was {{developed}} to predict the coupled flexure-compression and shear responses of the reinforced concrete walls subjected to cyclic loading. The macro-model was idealized with multiple longitudinal uniaxial elements of concrete and re-bar to describe the flexure- compression responses of walls. To describe the shear response significantly affected by cyclic loading, <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> elements were used. In the <b>diagonal</b> <b>strut</b> elements, for the web concrete, uniaxial cyclic models of concrete and steel re-bar were used. In the cyclic models, the confinement effect of concrete in wall boundary elements and the compressive softening of web concrete were considered. For verification, the proposed macro-model was applied to existing slender, low-rise, and coupled wall specimens subjected to cyclic loading. Further, the proposed macro-model was applied to three-dimensional nonlinear time history analysis for a 1 : 5 scale 10 -story R.C. wall specimen of residential building specimen, which was tested on a shaking table.|$|E
