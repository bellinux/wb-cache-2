Retrospective <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> BBFE in French healthcare facilities {{on a voluntary}} basis from 2003 to 2012 with a focus on those enrolled every year from 2008 to 2012 (stable cohort 2008 - 12). Reported BBFE incidence rate per 100 beds decreased from 7. 5 % in 2003 to 6. 3 % in 2012 (minus 16 %). Percutaneous injuries were the most frequent reported BBFE (84. 0 % in 2003 and 79. 1 % in 2012). Compliance with glove use (59. 1 % in 2003 to 67. 0 % in 2012) and sharps-disposal container accessibility (68. 1 % in 2003 to 73. 4 % in 2012) have both increased. A significant drop in preventable BBFE was observed (48. 3 % in 2003 to 30. 9 % in 2012). Finally, the use of safety-engineered devices increased from 2008 to 2012. Of the 415, 209 hospital beds in France, 26, 158 BBFE could have occurred in France in 2012, compared with 35, 364 BBFE in 2003.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) -infected {{physicians}} {{have been reported}} to infect some of their patients during exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). There is no European consensus on the policy for the prevention of this transmission. To help define an appropriate preventive policy, we determined the prevalence of HCV infection among EPP-performing medical personnel in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The prevalence of HCV infection was studied among 729 EPP-performing health care workers. Serum samples, stored after post-hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination testing in the years 2000 – 2009, were tested for HCV antibodies. Repeat reactive samples were confirmed by immunoblot assay and the detection of HCV RNA. The average age of the 729 health care workers was 39  years (range 18 – 66), suggesting a considerable cumulative occupational exposure to the blood. Nevertheless, only one of the 729 workers (0. 14 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: < 0. 01 % to 0. 85 %) was tested and confirmed to be positive for anti-HCV and positive for HCV RNA, which is comparable to the prevalence of HCV among Amsterdam citizens. Against this background, for the protection of personnel and patients, careful follow-up after needlestick injuries may be sufficient. If a zero-risk approach is desirable and costs are less relevant, the recurrent screening of EPP-performing personnel for HCV is superior to the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> occupational exposures...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} of fine localizing the polymorphisms responsible for genotype-phenotype correlations {{is emerging as}} an important constraint in the implementation and interpretation of genetic association studies, and calls for the definition of protocols for the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> associated variants. One recent example is the 3435 C>T polymorphism in the multidrug transporter gene ABCB 1, associated with protein expression and activity, and with several clinical conditions. Available data suggest that 3435 C>T may not directly cause altered transport activity, but {{may be associated with}} one or more causal variants in the poorly characterized stretch of linkage disequilibrium (LD) surrounding it. Here we describe a strategy for the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> associations, including a Bayesian formalization of the associated interval concept previously described by Goldstein. We focus on the region of high LD around 3435 C>T to compile an exhaustive list of variants by (1) using a relatively coarse set of marker typings to assess the pattern of LD, and (2) resequencing derived and ancestral chromosomes at 3435 C>T through the associated interval. We identified three intronic sites that are strongly associated with the 3435 C>T polymorphism. One of them is associated with multidrug resistance in patients with epilepsy (chi 2 = 3. 78, P = 0. 052), and sits within a stretch of significant evolutionary conservation. We argue that these variants represent additional candidates for influencing multidrug resistance due to P-glycoprotein activity, with the IVS 26 + 80 T>C being the best candidate among the three intronic sites. Finally, we describe a set of six haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms that represent common ABCB 1 variation surrounding 3435 C>T in Europeans. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal {{illnesses}} (GI) {{continue to}} pose a substantial burden in terms of morbidity and economic impact in Canada. We describe the epidemiology of reportable GI in Ontario by characterizing the incidence of each reportable GI, as well as associated demographics, clinical outcomes, seasonality, risk settings, and likely sources <b>of</b> infection. Methods <b>Reports</b> on laboratory confirmed cases of amebiasis, botulism, campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, giardiasis, hepatitis A, listeriosis, paratyphoid fever, salmonellosis, shigellosis, typhoid fever, illness due to verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC-illness), and yersiniosis, from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 were obtained from Ontario’s passive reportable disease surveillance system. Cases were classified by history of relevant travel, association with outbreaks, and likely source of infection, obtained through <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> cases by local health authorities. Results There were 29, 897 GI reported by health authorities in Ontario from 2007 to 2009. The most frequently reported diseases were campylobacteriosis (10, 916 cases or 36. 5 % of all GI illnesses) and salmonellosis (7, 514 cases, 25. 1 %). Overall, 26. 9 % <b>of</b> GI cases <b>reported</b> travel outside <b>of</b> Ontario during the relevant incubation period. Children four {{years of age and}} younger had the highest incidence rate for most GI, and significantly more (54. 8 %, p Conclusions Reportable GI continues to be a burden in Ontario. Since more than one in four GI cases experienced in Ontario were acquired outside of the province, international travel is an important risk factor for most GI. Because private homes are the most commonly reported risk settings and the main suspect sources of infection are food, animal contact and ill persons, these findings support the continued need for public health food safety programs, public education on safe handling of food and animals, and proper hand hygiene practices. </p...|$|R

40|$|Audits {{have been}} present since the Egyptian and Roman Empires in {{relation}} to the principal-agency relationship. Corporate governance {{is the way in which}} those managing an organisation (the agents) carry out their responsibilities towards their stakeholders (the principal). Agency problems mainly due to wealth maximization of agents result in agency costs detrimental to the principal. Internal audit acts as a monitoring mechanism within the organisation. Poor corporate governance has pointed to the ineffectiveness of internal audits to report on possible mismanagement, thus failing to give indications for preventive measures to be taken in due course by the management and stakeholders. World disasters like Enron, WorldCom and HIH group are classical cases in recent times. This calls for a measurement on the effectiveness of internal audits. The purpose of this research is to measure the effectiveness of internal audits conducted by internal auditors. The data were collected by way of questionnaire survey sent to internal auditors in Malaysian public institutions of higher learning and corporate members of the Institute of Internal Auditors Malaysia. The study considers the internal audit activities from the planning stage to the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> audit findings.

The internal audit activities assessed in this study give some indication of areas for improvement to be considered in the management of the internal audit function. It is the novelty of this unidimensional measurement method where it can be further applied to all other institutions of higher learning to determine the effectiveness of their internal audit, hence useful for national benchmarking purposes...|$|R

Traditionally, patients with FD lesions in the proximal femur underwent intra-lesional curettage and filling with autogenous bone graft. Initial attempts with cancellous bone grafts resulted in early graft resorption and recurrence of the lesions [9, 10]. Better results have been achieved with cortical bone graft. Enneking and Gearen reported early graft resorption in only two cases from a series of 15 patients. In all other cases, good symptom relief was obtained, with no further fracture or progression of deformity. However, Guille et al. [11] in their long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> 27 cases <b>reported</b> that all their bone grafts, cancellous and cortical, were resorbed and no lesion was eradicated or reduced. In addition, they argued that intra-lesional curettage disrupts the modest trabecular support that remains and further weakens the bone.|$|R
