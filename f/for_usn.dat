25|$|John Barry and Roger Charles of Newsweek {{wrote in}} their 13 July 1992 article that Rogers acted {{recklessly}} and without due care.

He also acted according to the prescribed rules of engagement <b>for</b> <b>USN</b> warship captains in that situation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{subsequent}} US {{report by}} Rear Admiral William Fogarty, titled Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on July 3, 1988, noted that Captain Rogers received some faulty {{information that he}} used to make the decision to fire. Specifically, he was told the aircraft was identified as an Iranian Air Force F-14 Tomcat descending in an attack profile, and that it was identifying itself with secondary surveillance radar / IFF mode-II codes exclusively used by military aircraft. The investigation noted that Rogers was focused on the ongoing surface engagement and was only aware of the inbound aircraft for less than four minutes. It also pointed out that Rogers thought that he had increased burden to act since he was also assigned to protect the frigate [...] The investigation also concluded that Rogers acted in a prudent manner based on the information available to him, and the short time frame involved. He also acted within the prescribed rules of engagement <b>for</b> <b>USN</b> warship captains in that situation.|$|E
2500|$|The Sino-American Cooperative Organization [...] was an {{organization}} {{created by the}} SACO Treaty signed by the Republic of China and the United States of America in 1942 that established a mutual intelligence gathering entity in China between the respective nations against Japan. It operated in China jointly along with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), America's first intelligence agency and forerunner of the CIA while also serving as joint training program between the two nations. Among all the wartime missions that Americans set up in China, SACO {{was the only one}} that adopted a policy of [...] "total immersion" [...] with the Chinese. The [...] "Rice Paddy Navy" [...] or [...] "What-the-Hell Gang" [...] operated in the China-Burma-India theater, advising and training, forecasting weather and scouting landing areas <b>for</b> <b>USN</b> fleet and Gen Claire Chennault's 14th AF, rescuing downed American flyers, and intercepting Japanese radio traffic. An underlying mission objective during the last year of war was the development and preparation of the China coast for Allied penetration and occupation. The Foochow (Fujian Province) was scouted as a potential staging area and springboard for the future military landing of Allies of World War II to Japan.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 March 1943, a new {{numbering}} system <b>for</b> <b>USN</b> fleets saw Task Force 44 become Task Force 74 of the United States Seventh Fleet. On 11 April, Australia {{was sent to}} investigate rumours of Japanese landings along the south-eastern shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but {{found no evidence of}} Japanese activity. The ships of the task force continued on with convoy escorting, refits, and patrols until 29 June, when Australia and five other ships were deployed to keep the sea lines of communication through the Coral and Arafura Seas, and to assist any transports in these areas. After encountering no Japanese forces and receiving no calls for assistance, the ships withdrew to the Flinders Group on 4 July. Six days later, Task Force 74 was sent to Espiritu Santo to reinforce the United States Third Fleet, which had lost four cruisers to torpedoes (one sunk, three withdrawn for major repairs) while supporting the New Georgia Campaign. Arriving on 16 July, Australia and the other ships were assigned to Espiritu Santo's western waters. At sunset on 20 July, Task Force 74 was returning to Espiritu Santo when [...] was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine: Crutchley believed that the submarine had fired at Australia at long range, but the speed of the task force may have been underestimated, causing the torpedoes to miss the heavy cruiser, while one hit the following Hobart.|$|E
