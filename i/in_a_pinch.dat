500|$|James {{noted that}} Stengel {{was not only}} the most {{successful}} manager of the 1950s, he was the most dominant manager of any single decade in baseball history. Stengel used his entire squad as Yankee manager, in contrast to other teams when he began his tenure, on which substitutes tended to get little playing time. Stengel's use of platooning meant more players saw more use, and he was generally more prone to put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter or replace his pitcher than other managers. Although only once in Stengel's time (1954) did the Yankees lead the league in number of pinch hitters, Stengel was known for using them in odd situations, once pinch-hitting for Moose Skowron in the first inning after a change of pitcher. Additionally, according to James, Stengel [...] "rotated lineups with mad abandon, using perhaps 70 to 100 different lineups in a 154 game season". Although Stengel was not the first Yankee manager to use a regular relief pitcher—Harris had seen success with Joe Page in 1947—his adoption of the concept did much to promote it.|$|E
500|$|McGraw brought several outfielders into spring {{training}} with the Giants.

Stengel, at McGraw's request, acted as a coach to the young players on the [...] "B" [...] squad, [...] and worked hard, getting key hits in {{spring training}} games, and making the Giants as a reserve outfielder. McGraw and Stengel sometimes stayed up all night, discussing baseball strategy. [...] With two Giant outfielders injured by June, Stengel was put in center field, and hit [...]368 in 84 games, as McGraw platooned him against right handers. If Stengel had enough plate appearances to qualify for the league batting championship, he would have finished second to Rogers Hornsby of the St. Louis Cardinals, who hit [...]401. The Giants played the Yankees again in the 1922 World Series; Stengel went 1–4 in Game 1, nursing an injured right leg muscle, which he aggravated running out an infield single in his first at bat in Game 2. Stengel was obviously limping when he was advanced to second base on another single, and McGraw sent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> runner. He did not use Stengel again in the Series, which the Giants won, four games to zero, with one tie. After the Series, Stengel and other major leaguers went on a barnstorming tour of Japan and the Far East.|$|E

The second outbreak, in 1840, killed all the remaining settlers (or, according to different accounts, spared just one girl). Depopulation of Zashiversk spawned a Siberian legend: when local traders found a chest abandoned at the fairground, a shaman prohibited opening the chest while an Orthodox priest agreed to open it. Traders opened the chest ... and released the grim reaper. According to George Kennan, in 1879 the bureaucracy believed that the deserted town still existed, and dispatched Hermann Schiller, a political exile from Poltava, on a 3,700 mile march on foot to Zashiversk.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{dynamics}} of a discrete isometry group action <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinched</b> Hadamard manifold nearby its parabolic fixed points. Due to Margulis Lemma, such an action on corresponding horospheres is virtually nilpotent, so we solve the problem by establishing a structural theorem for discrete groups acting on connected nilpotent Lie groups. As applications, we show that parabolic fixed points of a discrete isometry group cannot be conical limit points, that the fundamental groups of geometrically finite orbifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature are finitely presented, and the orbifolds themselves are topologically finite...|$|R
