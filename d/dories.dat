5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, <b>dories,</b> sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dory</b> {{married his}} first wife, Jimmie, on June 8, 1960. Together, {{they have three}} children: <b>Dory</b> III, Adam Dirk, and Penny. They also have five grandchildren. They later {{separated}} and were officially divorced on July 6, 1983. <b>Dory</b> III went into medicine and now practices out of Colorado. <b>Dory</b> IV is now training to be a wrestler under <b>Dory</b> Jr. In 1980, <b>Dory</b> met his second and current wife, Marti; the couple married in 1989. He has two children.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dories</b> {{were widely}} built from Long Island Sound to Nova Scotia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} larger power <b>dories,</b> notably the St Pierre dory, about thirty {{feet long and}} similar in shape to the Banks dory, and the Boston power dory of Boston Harbor.|$|E
25|$|Modern dory {{designers}} include Phil Bolger of Gloucester and John Welsford of New Zealand. Most modern <b>dories</b> {{are about}} 15–16 feet long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and epoxy resin. They are much lighter than traditional <b>dories</b> and {{compensate for the}} lack of initial stability by having slightly wider bottoms and very low (8inch high) seats and are fitted with skegs for directional stability. Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a rope that can be thrown to either the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy it is dangerous to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dory</b> - Originally Martha's best friend, when Ella is off school {{checking}} on her Mum. <b>Dory</b> and Martha become friends with Sally. <b>Dory</b> {{does not like}} Martha very much but is scared to say because Martha is quite rude. <b>Dory</b> is slightly like the beloved character <b>Dory</b> from Finding Nemo, because of her sunny nature and friendliness. However, she agrees with Sally's negative comments about Ella, therefore Ella doesn't like her very much.|$|R

25|$|Explorer had two 1,500-U.S.-gallon (1,249- Imperial-gallon; 5,678-liter) tanks for {{gasoline}} and diesel oil for the fleet of 16 boats she operated, consisting of four 30-foot (9.1-meter) heavy launches powered by 30-hp (22.4-Kw) diesel engines and outfitted for hydrographic surveying, two additional launches carried on heavy davits, two 24-foot (7.3-meter) whaleboats powered by gasoline engines, two non-magnetic whaleboats, and six 16- and 20-foot (4.9- and 6.1-meter) skiffs and <b>dories.</b> She {{also had a}} 5-ton magazine for the storage of explosives used in radio acoustic ranging operations.|$|E
25|$|Most modern power <b>dories</b> have a wider stern {{to support}} {{the weight of the}} outboard. Because flat bottom boats have a well founded {{reputation}} for pounding in anything other than flat sea conditions this type is not widespread. Some designers have taken element of the dory and incorporated these in V bottom boats.The planing shoe is a narrow flat section on the bottom of some V bottom boats that promotes planing at lower speed. The New Zealand designer John Welsford created a plywood, multi chine design with a wider planing shoe, suited to lower horsepower motors (10-30) suited to river and inshore use.|$|E
500|$|The system {{produced}} {{tropical storm}} force winds on Bermuda, which caused {{the suspension of}} schools, transportation, and interrupted businesses, although minimal structural damage occurred. Light rainfall was also reported on the island. Hurricane force winds were observed throughout Newfoundland, which caused damage to structures, though mostly limited to broken windows. Rough seas damaged fishing <b>dories</b> and a fishing ramp on the Atlantic coast of the island. The cost of damage on the Burin Peninsula {{was estimated to be}} in the thousands of dollars, although the specific figure in unknown.

500|$|Shortly before {{transitioning}} into an extratropical cyclone, {{the hurricane}} {{moved across the}} extreme southeastern portion of Newfoundland at Category1 intensity. As a result, high winds were reported across the region; wind speeds of 90mph (145km/h) occurred on the Burin Peninsula. Wind damage occurred throughout the island, although mostly limited to broken windows, trees being uprooted, and fences knocked over. [...] In addition, a house under construction blew over in Marystown; another house was abandoned in St. John's for {{the fear of the}} roof blowing off. Hydro poles also caught fire in Burin and Grand Banks. Rough seas caused by the storm sunk or damage several fishing <b>dories</b> in Grand Bank and three fishing premises were washed away in Lamaline. In addition, a fishing ramp was washed out to sea in Lourdes Cove. Damage in the Burin Peninsula alone totaled to thousands of dollars, although the exact figure is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Other, {{less common}} but {{traditional}} types were the double ended surf and gunning <b>dories.</b> [...] The pointed bow and sterns made these boats excel at launching through the surf.

Simeon's grandson, Hiram Lowell developed the Banks Dory. The major innovation was the straight sides to the new Banks Dory. This made the boats stackable on top one another.

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{assumed that the}} Banks dory was the {{original}} dory. In fact, the Swampscott dory preceded the Banks dory by fifty years. The Banks <b>dories</b> {{first appeared in the}} 1830s and were probably the most numerous at their height of popularity. [...] They were [...] "designed specifically as a ships boat but it became so well known and so common a type that it not only was used alongshore but influenced the design of some local fishing boats". [...] Adapted almost directly from the low-freeboard French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank <b>dories</b> could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, for their trip to the Grand Banks and other fishing banks. They are not as handy or easy to row as the slightly more complicated Swampscott <b>dories</b> but were mass-produced in much larger numbers. Banks <b>dories</b> were also popular as work boats.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dories</b> {{appeared}} in New England fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century. They were small, shallow-draft boats, usually about {{five to seven}} metres (15 to 22feet) long.

50|$|The McKenzie River <b>dory,</b> or drift boat, is an {{adaptation}} of the open-water <b>dory</b> converted for use in rivers. A variant of the boat's hull is called a modified McKenzie <b>dory</b> or Rogue River <b>dory.</b> The McKenzie designs are characterized by a wide, flat bottom, flared sides, a narrow, flat bow, and a pointed stern. The sole identifying characteristic of the McKenzie River <b>dory</b> is a continuous rocker (the arc from bow to stern {{along the bottom of}} the boat). It is this constant rocker that allows the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids.|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known <b>dories</b> were beach <b>dories</b> {{developed for}} beach-launched fishing operations. The principal {{example is the}} Swampscott dory, named after Swampscott, Massachusetts where they were introduced. Early wherry types were modified with flat bottoms and borrowed construction techniques found in the French bateaus. [...] This resulted in an almost-round-sided boat with a narrow flat bottom, well suited to launching through the surf and able to hold up against aggressive ocean conditions. The narrow [...] "tombstone" [...] transom assured that the boat rode well against a following sea or breaking surf, and also made the boat easy to row.|$|E
