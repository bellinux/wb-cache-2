Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is {{at the apex of}} a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm.

Women, particularly women in rural areas, {{do not have access to}} safe and self-controlled methods of contraception. The public health system emphasises permanent methods like sterilisation, or long-term methods like IUDs that do not need follow-up. Sterilisation accounts for more than 75% of total contraception, with female sterilisation accounting for almost 95% of all sterilisations. The contraceptive prevalence rate for 2007/2008 was estimated at 54.8%.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} is to individually knock out each gene in a genome and observe the effect on normal and cancerous cells. If the knockout of an otherwise nonessential gene <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> effect on healthy cells, but is lethal to cancerous cells containing a mutated oncogene, then the system-wide suppression of the suppressed gene can destroy cancerous cells while leaving healthy ones relatively undamaged. The technique was used to identify PARP-1 inhibitors to treat BRCA1/BRCA2-associated cancers. In this case, the combined presence of PARP-1 inhibition and of the cancer-associated mutations in BRCA genes is lethal only to the cancerous cells.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, {{there are}} many {{different}} kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e. <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous {{carriers}} (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal {{enzyme activity}} but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used {{up in the}} process, so only small enzyme quantities are required {{to carry out a}} reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has {{at least half of the}} normal enzyme activity level, due to expression of the wild-type allele. This level is normally enough to enable normal function and thus prevent phenotypic expression.|$|E

25|$|Progestogens have antigonadotropic effects at {{sufficiently}} high dosages via {{activation of}} the PR and consequent negative feedback on and hence suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. The minimum ovulation-inhibiting (i.e., contraceptive) dosage of OMP in women, this effect being the result of suppression of the mid-cycle surge in gonadotropin secretion, is 300mg/day. Conversely, treatment with a high dosage of OMP of 100mg four times per day (or 400mg/day total) in men for 10days that resulted in approximately mid-luteal phase levels of progesterone (7.9–9.4ng/mL) did not cause any change in testosterone levels, suggesting that progesterone <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> antigonadotropic effect in males at typical clinical dosages. On the other hand, a single 50mg intramuscular injection of progesterone, which is associated with very high progesterone levels of approximately 50ng/mL (or early- to mid-pregnancy levels), resulted in substantial (50–60%) suppression of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone levels in men.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam is {{selective}} for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the α1 subunit, {{similar to other}} drugs such as zaleplon and zolpidem. As a result, quazepam <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> muscle relaxant properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABAA receptors include the α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors which are responsible for hypnotic properties of the drug. Type 2 receptors include the α2, α3 and α5 subunits which are responsible for anxiolytic action, amnesia and muscle relaxant properties. Thus quazepam may have less side effects than other benzodiazepines but, {{it has a very}} long half-life of 25 hours which reduces its benefits as a hypnotic due to likely next day sedation. It also has two active metabolites with half-lives of 28 and 79 hours. Quazepam may also cause less drug tolerance than other benzodiazepines such as temazepam and triazolam perhaps due to its subtype selectivity. The longer half-life of quazepam may have the advantage however, of causing less rebound insomnia than shorter acting subtype selective nonbenzodiazepines. However, one of the major metabolites of quazepam, the N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam (aka N-desalkylflurazepam), binds unselectively to both type1 and type2 GABAA receptors. The N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite also has a very long half-life and likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of quazepam.|$|E
