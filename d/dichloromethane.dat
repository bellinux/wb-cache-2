5|$|Another {{source of}} {{poisoning}} is {{exposure to the}} organic solvent <b>dichloromethane,</b> found in some paint strippers, as the metabolism of <b>dichloromethane</b> produces carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|In the Waco Siege, CS was {{dissolved}} in the organic solvent <b>dichloromethane</b> (also known as methylene chloride). The solution was dispersed as an aerosol via explosive force {{and when the}} highly volatile <b>dichloromethane</b> evaporated, CS crystals precipitated and formed a fine dispersion in the air.|$|E
5|$|The DMT {{group is}} removed with a {{solution}} of an acid, such as 2% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA), in an inert solvent (<b>dichloromethane</b> or toluene). The orange-colored DMT cation formed is washed out; the step results in the solid support-bound oligonucleotide precursor bearing a free 5'-terminal hydroxyl group.|$|E
5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including <b>dichloromethane,</b> chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in <b>dichloromethane</b> (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dichloromethane</b> (DCM, or {{methylene}} chloride) is {{an organic}} compound with the formula CH2Cl2. This colorless, volatile liquid with a moderately sweet aroma {{is widely used}} as a solvent. Although it is not miscible with water, it is miscible with many organic solvents. One of the most well-known applications of <b>dichloromethane</b> is in the drinking bird heat engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} decrease causes {{some of the}} <b>dichloromethane</b> vapor in {{the head}} to condense.|$|E
25|$|Carbon diselenide is {{a linear}} {{molecule}} with D∞h symmetry. It {{is produced by}} reacting selenium powder with <b>dichloromethane</b> vapor near 550°C.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} these {{processes}} {{is a mixture of}} chloromethane, <b>dichloromethane,</b> chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. These compounds are separated by distillation.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} this process is a mixture of the four chloromethanes (chloromethane, <b>dichloromethane,</b> chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride), which can then be {{separated}} by distillation.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of acute}} {{overexposure}} to <b>dichloromethane</b> via inhalation include difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation {{of the upper}} respiratory tract and eyes. More severe consequences can include suffocation, loss of consciousness, coma, and death.|$|E
25|$|Short chain haloalkanes such as <b>dichloromethane,</b> {{trichloromethane}} (chloroform) and tetrachloromethane {{are commonly}} used as hydrophobic solvents in chemistry. They were formerly very common in industry; however, their use has been greatly curtailed due to their toxicity and harmful environmental effects.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is {{employed in the}} isolation of iodine from natural sources. Air will oxidize iodide, {{as evidenced by the}} observation of a purple extract when aged samples of KI are rinsed with <b>dichloromethane.</b> As formed under acidic conditions, hydriodic acid (HI) is a stronger reducing agent.|$|E
25|$|Chloroform volatilizes readily from {{soil and}} surface water and {{undergoes}} degradation in air to produce phosgene, <b>dichloromethane,</b> formyl chloride, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. Its half-life in air ranges from 55 to 620 days. Biodegradation {{in water and}} soil is slow. Chloroform does not significantly bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Removal of the Boc in {{amino acids}} can be {{accomplished}} with strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid neat or in <b>dichloromethane</b> or with HCl in methanol. A complication may be the tendency of the t-butyl cation intermediate to alkylate other nucleophiles; scavengers such as anisole or thioanisole may be used.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{ozonolysis}} {{is carried}} out in a solution of <b>dichloromethane,</b> at a temperature of −78oC. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. zinc in acetic acid or dimethyl sulfide), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic hydrogen peroxide), carboxylic acids will be formed.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} solvents is the boiling point. This also determines {{the speed of}} evaporation. Small amounts of low-boiling-point solvents like diethyl ether, <b>dichloromethane,</b> or acetone will evaporate in seconds at room temperature, while high-boiling-point solvents like water or dimethyl sulfoxide need higher temperatures, an air flow, or the application of vacuum for fast evaporation.|$|E
25|$|Chemicals {{that have}} been linked to various forms of cancer were also discovered, as well as trichloroethylene, known to impair fetal development, at 50 times above safety limits {{specified}} by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2002, an inquiry by Fact-Finding Mission on Bhopal found a number of toxins, including mercury, lead, 1,3,5 trichlorobenzene, <b>dichloromethane</b> and chloroform, in nursing women's breast milk.|$|E
25|$|Jaffe et al. {{discovered}} that O. bauri uses a volatile substance, <b>dichloromethane</b> (CH2Cl2), {{in order to}} recognize one another. The trick in knowing one’s relative is {{by the amount of}} substance produced upon antennation. Further analysis using gas chromatography was used to determine that each trap jaw ant from a different colony have different amounts of volatile chemicals within its system.|$|E
25|$|The use of triethylsilane as a carbocation {{scavenger}} in {{the presence}} of trifluoroacetic acid in <b>dichloromethane</b> has been shown to lead to increased yields, decreased reaction times, simple work-up and improved selectivity for the deprotection of t-butyl ester and t-butoxycarbonyl sites in protected amino-acids and peptides {{in the presence}} of other acid-sensitive protecting groups such as the benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, O- and S-benzyl and t-butylthio groups.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{naming of}} haloalkanes should follow IUPAC nomenclature, which put the halogen as a prefix to the alkane. For example, ethane with bromine becomes bromoethane, methane with four {{chlorine}} groups becomes tetrachloromethane. However, {{many of these}} compounds have already an established trivial name, which is endorsed by the IUPAC nomenclature, for example chloroform (trichloromethane) and methylene chloride (<b>dichloromethane).</b> For unambiguity, this article follows the systematic naming scheme throughout.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} {{have a lower}} density than water, {{which means}} they are lighter and will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the halogenated solvents like <b>dichloromethane</b> or chloroform will sink {{to the bottom of}} a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is important to remember when partitioning compounds between solvents and water in a separatory funnel during chemical syntheses.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{drinking}} bird's appearance and classification as a toy {{there is a}} potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. <b>Dichloromethane</b> can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.|$|E
25|$|A {{drinking}} bird {{consists of}} two glass bulbs joined by a glass tube (the bird's neck). The tube extends nearly {{all the way into}} the bottom bulb, and attaches to the top bulb but does not extend into it. The space inside the bird contains a fluid, usually colored. The fluid is typically <b>dichloromethane,</b> also known as methylene chloride. Earlier versions contained trichlorofluoromethane. Miles V. Sullivan's 1945 patent suggested ether, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, or chloroform.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, Scottish {{obstetrician}} James Y. Simpson was {{the first}} to demonstrate the anaesthetic properties of chloroform on humans and helped to popularise the drug for use in medicine. By the 1850s, chloroform was being produced on a commercial basis by using the Liebig procedure, which retained its importance until the 1960s. Today, chloroform — along with <b>dichloromethane</b> — is prepared exclusively and on a massive scale by the chlorination of methane and chloromethane.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like <b>dichloromethane</b> and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as <b>dichloromethane</b> or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{fetus is}} even more {{susceptible}} to damage from carbon monoxide intake, which can be harmful when inhaled during pregnancy, usually through first or second-hand tobacco smoke. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the infant born to a non-smoking mother is around 2%, and this concentration drastically increases {{to a range of}} 6%–9% if the mother smokes tobacco. Other possible sources of prenatal carbon monoxide intoxication are exhaust gas from combustion motors, use of <b>dichloromethane</b> (paint thinner, varnish removers) in enclosed areas, defective gas hot water heaters, indoor barbeques, open flames in poorly-ventilated areas, atmospheric exposure in highly polluted areas.|$|E
25|$|Solvents with a {{dielectric}} constant (more accurately, relative static permittivity) greater than 15 (i.e. polar or polarizable) {{can be further}} divided into protic and aprotic. Protic solvents solvate anions (negatively charged solutes) strongly via hydrogen bonding. Water is a protic solvent. Aprotic solvents such as acetone or <b>dichloromethane</b> tend to have large dipole moments (separation of partial positive and partial negative charges within the same molecule) and solvate positively charged species via their negative dipole. In chemical reactions the use of polar protic solvents favors the SN1 reaction mechanism, while polar aprotic solvents favor the SN2 reaction mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The Cornforth reagent (pyridinium dichromate, PDC), pyridinium {{chlorochromate}} (PCC), the Collins reagent (complex of chromium(VI) oxide with pyridine in <b>dichloromethane)</b> and the Sarret reagent (complex of chromium(VI) oxide with pyridine in pyridine) {{are similar}} chromium-based pyridine compounds, {{which are also}} used for oxidation, namely conversion of primary and secondary alcohols to ketones. The Collins and Sarret reagents are both difficult and dangerous to prepare, they are hygroscopic and can inflame during preparation. For this reason, the use of PCC and PDC was preferred. Those reagents were rather popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but because of their toxicity and confirmed carcinogenic status, they are rarely used nowadays.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (denatured alcohol), acetone, and <b>Dichloromethane</b> which is usually found {{in the form of}} a commercial paint stripper. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{does not}} require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. polylactic acid in <b>dichloromethane)</b> then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze-dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and freeze-drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it {{does not require}} a time consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. Freeze-drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized.|$|E
25|$|Solvent casting and {{particulate}} leaching (SCPL) {{allows for}} the preparation of structures with regular porosity, but with limited thickness. First, the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent (e.g. polylactic acid could be dissolved into <b>dichloromethane),</b> then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles. Such porogen can be an inorganic salt like sodium chloride, crystals of saccharose, gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres. The size of the porogen particles will affect {{the size of the}} scaffold pores, while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure. After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate, then the composite structure in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen: water in the case of sodium chloride, saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like hexane for use with paraffin. Once the porogen has been fully dissolved, a porous structure is obtained. Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained, another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold.|$|E
