Laboratory tests and field experimental research, analysed coal reservoirs adsorption characteristics under the function of high temperature pyrolysis and metamorphism caused by layered magma intrusion, and revealed internal relations between coal seam adsorption characteristics and outburst indexes, which were verified in the field.

Because {{of the dangers of}} coal and <b>gas</b> <b>outburst,</b> the field test of the outburst is difficult to complete. Thus with the aid of physical simulation, observing simulation phenomenon of coal and <b>gas</b> <b>outburst</b> is very important in the laboratory (Xue et al. 2011). Physical simulation of coal and <b>gas</b> <b>outburst</b> has been rapid developed in recent years.

Zhang deduced the similarity criteria of physical and mechanical parameters by dimensional analysis in the perspective of mechanics, resulting in the similarity criteria which cover geometrical, load and material properties, but the relationship between stress and gas pressure is unknown (Zhang et al. 2016). Hu indicated the similarity criteria of three-dimensional solid–fluid coupling from solid–fluid coupling (Hu et al. 2007). Wang derived gas pressure ratio is p_p :p_m = 1, mechanical ratio C_E = C_σ^ 2 on the basis of solid–fluid coupling model and energy model. However, the mechanics ratio contradicts with C_E = C_σ that derived by E = σ /ε (Wang et al. 2015 a, b). Wang discussed the defor-mation of similar material and gas flow similar under the condition of triaxial compression (Wang et al. 2017).

Coal and <b>gas</b> <b>outburst</b> prevention project has become the prerequisite of underground coal mining, but its process control ability is especially poor. By integrating statistical process control theory into the process of coal and <b>gas</b> <b>outburst</b> prevention, three urgent problems were solved. First at all, data structure of the process inspection parameters was designed asvectors, which only consisted of principle elements and formed data series as time went by. Secondly, based on sample data of the experimental area, statistical characteristic of inspection parameters was gained and their X-Rs control charts were drawn. Finally, performance of process running statuses that might be in control or beyond control were analyzed in detail. When the process was in control, curves should slightly fluctuate around their center lines and between upper control limits and lower control limits. Otherwise, the process was beyond control, in which X control charts were used to identify anomalies of data value fluctuation and Rs control charts were used to identify anomalies of data fluctuation amplitudes.

Mining activity leads to desorption and flow of gas in the coal and creates favorable conditions for gas drainage.
