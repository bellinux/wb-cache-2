This assessment was performed by applying analytic hierarchy process. Analytic hierarchy process method allows variation of relative importance of specific risk sources dependent on the section from which the risk source originates (organizational environment, technical issues, people issues, adoption process management, and external support). Survey was conducted on 85 manufacturing enterprises involved with an <b>enterprises</b> <b>resource</b> <b>planning</b> solution. Ranking of risk sources assessments returns most frequent risks of <b>enterprises</b> <b>resource</b> <b>planning</b> implementation success in manufacturing enterprises, and representative factors were isolated through factor analysis by risk source origin. Finally, results indicate that there are hidden causes of failed implementation, for example, risk source “top management training and education,” from risk origin “adoption process management. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} way {{of using}} the <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Planning</b> (ERP) applications is inadequate for the highly dynamic, complex and demanding business environment. The efficient use of the ERP system relies heavily on the know-how, experience {{and quality of the}} users. Since the knowledge of operating ERP system is difficult to be acquired, shared and diffused among the users, it takes time and money to train well-experienced users. As a result, this paper presents a framework of Knowledge-based Simulation System for <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Planning</b> named KBSimERP. The KBSimERP provides an integrated learning environment for achieving three perspectives, which includes the knowledge acquisition, knowledge diffusion and performance measurement perspectives respectively. Hence, a prototype of the KBSimERP is built for production planning and control, and the performance of the system is preliminarily evaluated. Satisfactory results are obtained.

40|$|Organisations that {{implement}} <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Planning</b> (ERP) {{software packages}} {{are making a}} big commitment {{in terms of both}} time and money. Realising the ERP benefits, some organisations have successfully implemented while others have struggled, settled for minimum returns, and abandoned the system. Especially in a Geographically Distributed Environment (GDE), ERP implementation is more risky. To mitigate the risks, a knowledge sharing framework is suggested to be put in place during ERP implementation phases. The ERP implementation requires more knowledge about business processes, transaction rules, organisational structure, and other related transactions. Based on findings in an extensive study of three Canadian organisations that have gone through ERP implementation phases, this study examines tacit knowledge sharing in design, configuration, and testing of ERP systems. The lessons learned and knowledge sharing activities are given by presenting a cross-comparison of the case studies. <b>Enterprise</b> <b>resources</b> <b>planning,</b> geographically distributed environment, tacit knowledge sharing, ERP design, ERP implementation...|$|R

30|$|The service-oriented hosts in <b>enterprises</b> like <b>enterprise</b> <b>resources</b> <b>planning</b> (ERP) {{system have}} always {{encountered}} the crucial problem of unexpected down-time or system failure {{that will cause}} data loss and system termination. Failover is a challenge issue that cannot be done successfully between physical hosts. Traditional information security using demilitarized zone approach costs a lot. Therefore, this paper introduces in-cloud <b>enterprise</b> <b>resources</b> <b>planning</b> (in-cloud ERP) deployed in the virtual machine cluster together with access control authentication and network security which can resolve the three problems mentioned above. Access control authentication and network security have been implemented in the cloud computing system to prevent the service-oriented hosts form external fraud, intrusion, or malicious attacks. As {{a result of the}} experiments the number of accessing in-cloud ERP is 5.2 times as many as in-house ERP. The total expenditure of in-cloud ERP has decreased significantly to 48.4  % the cost of in-house ERP. In terms of operational speed, the approach proposed in this paper outperforms two well-known benchmark ERP systems, in-house ECC 6.0 and in-cloud ByDesign.|$|R

25|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} information that is useful to management and stakeholders for resource allocation decisions. For financial information to be useful, it should be timely and free from material errors, omissions, and fraud. In the real time economy, timely and reliable financial information is critical for day-to-day business decisions regarding strategic planning, capital acquisition, credit decisions, supplier partnerships, and so forth. Advances in accounting information systems such as the advent of <b>enterprise</b> <b>resource</b> <b>planning</b> (ERP) systems have enabled the generation of real time information. However, the practice of traditional auditing has not kept pace with the real time economy. Traditional manual audit procedures are labor and time intensive, which limits audit frequency to a periodic basis, such as annually.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{successful}} application of the CCU method {{can be found at}} Exact Software (ES). ES is a manufacturer of accounting and <b>enterprise</b> <b>resource</b> <b>planning</b> software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined Product Data Management (PDM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Software Configuration Management (SCM) {{in order to maintain the}} configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.|$|E
