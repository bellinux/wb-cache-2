500|$|In {{defending}} himself {{from what he}} believed was the elitism of his online critics, Idol admitted {{that he was still}} learning about computers, but compared it to the early punk ethic of simply trying your best as a musician, even if you had difficulty. He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer. [...] "I don't know much about computers, but I have the desire to learn and I have a computer and a modem, so <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it. Banging my head sometimes, but continuing on." ...|$|E
500|$|Duane Allman {{created the}} idea of having two lead guitarists, which was {{inspired}} by Curtis Mayfield; [...] " [...] wanted the bass, keyboards, and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping," [...] said Allman. Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians. [...] "The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques, often forming intricate, interlocking patterns {{with each other and with}} the bassist, Berry Oakley, setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies." [...] Dickey Betts' playing was very melody-based; [...] "My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight, because I’m such a melody guy that even when I’m playing the blues, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> melody first," [...] he said. His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably: [...] "I played mandolin, ukulele, and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar, which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from." [...] He later characterized their style as [...] "question and answer, anticipation and conclusion," [...] which involved allowing each musician's downbeat to arrive in a different spot, while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines.|$|E
500|$|Rachid Chouhal was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 37. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Chouhal qualified for the Games via a wildcard because his fastest time of 10.83 seconds, set at the Marsa Sports Complex on 2 June 2012, was 0.59 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 100 metres. Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I want something, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it. I am not afraid. I am confident in my training and am careful not to get hurt. I know that the level of the athletes competing in the 100 metre sprint is very high. My aim is to do a personal best or season's best." [...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) but behind the Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds). Overall Chouhal finished 58th out of 75 athletes, but did not progress to the first round because he was 0.21 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his meat who advanced to the later stages.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E

2500|$|After {{returning}} from his last European trip, Hopper rented {{a studio in}} New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had {{to knock on the}} doors of magazine and agency offices to find business. His painting languished: [...] "it's hard for me to decide what I want to paint. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly." [...] His fellow illustrator, Walter Tittle, described Hopper's depressed emotional state in sharper terms, seeing his friend [...] "suffering...from long periods of unconquerable inertia, sitting {{for days at a time}} before his easel in helpless unhappiness, unable to raise a hand to break the spell." ...|$|E
