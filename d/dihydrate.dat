40|$|The {{deterioration}} of concrete by sulfuric acid attack in sewage environments {{has become a}} serious problem. In this study, it was shown that the resistance to sulfuric acid of mortar and concrete can be improved by using a blast-furnace slag fine aggregate to {{the total amount of}} fine aggregate. When mortar or concrete reacts to sulfuric acid, <b>dihydrated</b> gypsum film is formed around the particulate of the fine aggregate. This <b>dihydrated</b> gypsum film could retard the penetration of sulfuric acid, thus improving the resistance to sulfuric acid. However, the resistance to sulfuric acid depends on the hardness of the <b>dihydrated</b> gypsum film...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{theoretical}} {{study on the}} electronic and topological aspects of the reaction of <b>dihydrated</b> Fe(OH) 2 with 6, 7, 8 -trioxabicyclo[3. 2. 2]nonane, {{as a model for}} the reaction of heme with artemisinin. A comparison is made with the reaction of <b>dihydrated</b> ferrous hydroxide with O 2, {{as a model for the}} heme interaction with oxygen. We found that <b>dihydrated</b> Fe(OH) 2 reacts more efficiently with the artemisinin model than with O 2. This result suggests that artemisinin instead of molecular oxygen would interact with heme, disrupting its detoxification process by avoiding the initial heme to hemin oxidation, and killing in this way the malaria parasite. The ELF and AIM theories provide support for such a conclusion, which further clarifies our understanding on how artemisinin acts as an antimalarial agent...|$|R
5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, is a white {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2. It forms a stable <b>dihydrate,</b> but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot.

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate <b>dihydrate,</b> or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the <b>dihydrate</b> NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
40|$|Abstract−The solvent {{treatment}} of paclitaxel is a convenient method for controlling the morphologies of paclitaxel. Amorphous paclitaxel was simply made by dissolving paclitaxel in methylene chloride/methanol (98 / 2, v/v) and in relatively non-polar solvents (t-butyl methyl ether, pentane, acetonitrile/hexane (1 / 2, v/v), methylene chloride, chloro-form). On the other hand, <b>dihydrated</b> paclitaxel (paclitaxel· 2 H 2 O) {{was made by}} dissolving paclitaxel in a special polar solvent containing {{a small amount of}} water. However, when we used only methanol, we got mixed morphologies of paclitaxel made of both the <b>dihydrated</b> and amorphous forms. Their physicochemical properties were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The initial water content of amorphous paclitaxel and <b>dihydrated</b> paclitaxel was determined for 0. 65 wt % and 5. 85 wt%, respectively. The hygroscopic property of <b>dihydrated</b> paclitaxel was very changeable in all given humidity (15, 60, 95 RH%) during storage. Dissolution profiles for paclitaxel showed that amorphous paclitaxel measured the highest solubility in water and its solubility held most stable during the measurements. The residual solvent could be reduced to the maximum allowed value (600 ppm for methylene chloride, 3, 000 ppm for methanol) of guidance for the Inter-national Conference on Harmonization (ICH) by spray drying...|$|R
40|$|The {{anhydrous}} sodium naproxen (ASN) {{can form}} several hydrated phases if maintained at different relative humidities (RH).

In a previous work, the authors showed that a <b>dihydrated</b> form could be obtained either by crystallization in water or by exposure of the anhydrous form to a RH of 55 %. In the present work, the authors report about the formation and characterization of a new tetrahydrated form, obtained by exposing the ASN to RH >= 75 %. All the hydrated compounds were characterized by the combined use of several spectroscopic, thermal, and crystallographic techniques.

5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate <b>dihydrate</b> that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{surface is}} covered with a {{transparent}} layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, but it is possible that it is entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia <b>dihydrate</b> in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton's surface area is 23millionkm2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. Triton's reddish colour is thought {{to be the result of}} methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

40|$|Examination of the {{observational}} basis for Kuiper's (1969) {{conclusion that the}} upper cloud layers of Venus are composed of <b>dihydrated</b> ferrous chloride particles.

(1968). Evidence for an absorption band on Venus near 0. 5 micron is found to be valid, but nondefinitive in terms of the identification of ferrous iron. An absorption band near 0. 39 micron appearing in the Venus photometric data of Irvine et al. (1968) is judged to be unreliable as an indicator of chemical composition, because of time-dependent variations in the violet and ultraviolet clouds and spectrum of Venus. In conclusion, it is found that the evidence for <b>dihydrated</b> ferrous chloride in the atmosphere of Venus is inconclusive...|$|R

40|$|With I 3 C {{cross-polarization}} magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR it {{is demonstrated}} that the anhydrous forms of DL- and L-DPPC show pronounced packing differences in both the headgroup region and the hydrocarbon part of the bilayer. In DL-DPPC the acyl chains and more specifically their end groups are more closely packed than in the L modification. The anhydrous L- and DL-DPPC structures show a completely different behavior toward the addition of 1 equiv of water. DL-DPPC is far less hygroscopic and forms small domains of <b>dihydrated</b> and anhydrous DPPC as was concluded from the combined results of the NMR and a DSC study. The <b>dihydrated</b> form of DL-DPPC is arranged according to a similar structure as is observed for anhydrous L-DPPC.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intrinsic}} hydration {{of three}} monopositive uranyl-anion complexes (UO 2 A) + (where A = acetate, nitrate, or hydroxide) was investigated using ion-trap mass spectrometry (IT-MS). The relative {{rates for the}} formation of the monohydrates [(UO 2 A) (H 2 O) ]+, with respect to the anion, followed the trend: Acetate ≥ nitrate ≫ hydroxide. This finding was rationalized in terms of the donation of electron density by the strongly basic OH− to the uranyl metal center, thereby reducing the Lewis acidity of U and its propensity to react with incoming nucleophiles, viz., H 2 O. An alternative explanation is that the more complex acetate and nitrate anions provide increased degrees of freedom that could accommodate excess energy from the hydration reaction. The monohydrates also reacted with water, forming <b>dihydrates</b> and then trihydrates. The rates for formation of the nitrate and acetate <b>dihydrates</b> [(UO 2 A) (H 2 O) 2]+ were very similar to the rates for formation of the monohydrates; the presence of the first H 2 O ligand had no influence on the addition of the second.
