40|$|The group-specific antigen {{of group}} B Streptococcus is {{composed}} of four different oligosaccharide units of Mw 766 (III), 1277 (II), 1462 (IV), and 1788 (I). The major constituent sugars of the oligosaccharides are alpha-L-rhamnopyranose, alpha-D-galactopyranose, 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, and <b>D-glucitol</b> except that III does not contain alpha-D-galactopyranosyl or 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues and IV contains no <b>D-glucitol</b> but has one additional beta-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue. The structures of II and III have been previously elucidated [Michon, F., Katzenellenbogen, E., Kasper, D. L., & Jennings, H. J. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 476 - 486]. In the group B antigen all the oligosaccharides are linked by one type of phosphodiester bond from O 6 of the <b>D-glucitol</b> residue of one oligosaccharide to O 6 of the alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residue of the next to form a complex and highly branched multiantennary structure. However, despite the heterogeneous nature of its component oligosaccharides, some order has been identified in the biosynthesis of the group B antigen from chemical and enzymatic sequence studies. Because III lacks an alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residue but has a <b>D-glucitol</b> residue, it is situated at the reducing terminus of all {{the branches of the}} group B antigen where it is always adjacent to a II moiety. Conversely, IV has an alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residue but has no <b>D-glucitol</b> and is therefore located at the reducing terminus of the group B antigen where it probably functions as a linker molecule between the group B polysaccharide and the cell wall peptidoglycan of the group B streptococcal organisms. Oligosaccharide I contains two alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residues and one <b>D-glucitol</b> residue and thus constitutes the branch point in the group B antigen, whereas II contains one of each of the above residues and therefore is situated in linear interchain positions.

40|$|Acetal condensations of {{a number}} of {{aldehydes}} with <b>D-glucitol</b> in dilute aqueous and non-aqueous acid media havebeen followed polarimetrically. Those involving acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n- and iso-butyraidehyde and benzaldehyde apparently proceed via a kinetically controlled intermediate, with a comparatively large negative optical rotation, before attaining an equilibrium in which the 2, 4 -monoacetal is the major product. Similar behaviour has not been observed with either formaldehyde or trichloroacetaldehyde. For the reactions of <b>D-glucitol</b> with n-outyraldehyde and benzaldehyde the intermediate compounds have been isolated, characterized and shown to be the 2, 3 - 0 -outylidene and 2, 3 - 0 -oenzylidene-D-glucitols respectively, which were previously unknown Proton magnetic resonance (PMR) spectroscopic studies have been carried out on both compounds and these results, together with melting point and specific rotation data, indicated the 2, 3 - 0 -oenzylidene compound, as isolated, to be a mixture of diastereoisomers. Work on the hydrolyses of these two acetals suggested that they are considerably more labile than the corresponding 2, 4 -monoacetals. Moreover, 2, 3 - 0 -benzylidene-D-glucitol was hydrolysed much more rapidly than the butylidene compound. In non-aqueous media, both compounds underwent ring migrations in which the 2, 4 -monoacetals appeared to be the principal products. The reactions of n-butyraldehyde with various derivatives of <b>D-glucitol</b> in dilute aqueous acid have been studied in a similar manner, and four new acetals have been isolated and identified. 1 -Deoxy-D-glucitol reacted {{in the same way as}} <b>D-glucitol,</b> forming 2, 3 - 0 -butylidene- 1 -deoxy-D-glucitol under kinetic control which subsequently passed to 2, 4 -O-butylidene- 1 -deoxy-D-glucitol.

40|$|The {{glucitol}} operon (gutAEBDMRQ) of Escherichia coli encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase {{system that}} metabolizes the hexitol <b>d-glucitol</b> (sorbitol). The functions {{for all but}} the last gene, gutQ, have been previously assigned. The high sequence similarity between GutQ and KdsD, a d-arabinose 5 -phosphate isomerase (API) from the 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (KDO) -lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthetic pathway, suggested a putative activity, but its role {{within the context of the}} gut operon remained unclear. Accordingly, the enzyme was cloned, overexpressed, and characterized. Recombinant GutQ was shown to indeed be a second copy of API from the E. coli K- 12 genome with biochemical properties similar to those of KdsD, catalyzing the reversible aldol-ketol isomerization between d-ribulose 5 -phosphate (Ru 5 P) and d-arabinose 5 -phosphate (A 5 P). Genomic disruptions of each API gene were constructed in E. coli K- 12. TCM 11 [(ΔkdsD) ] was capable of sustaining essential LPS synthesis at wild-type levels, indicating that GutQ functions as an API inside the cell. The gut operon remained inducible in TCM 7 [(ΔgutQ) ], suggesting that GutQ is not directly involved in <b>d-glucitol</b> catabolism. The conditional mutant TCM 15 [(ΔgutQΔkdsD) ] was dependent on exogenous A 5 P both for LPS synthesis/growth and for upregulation of the gut operon. The phenotype was suppressed by complementation in trans with a plasmid encoding a functional copy of GutQ or by increasing the amount of A 5 P in the medium. As there is no obvious obligatory role for GutQ in the metabolism of <b>d-glucitol</b> and there is no readily apparent link between <b>d-glucitol</b> metabolism and LPS biosynthesis, it is suggested that A 5 P is not only a building block for KDO biosynthesis but also may be a regulatory molecule involved in expression of the gut operon...|$|E

The synthesis of isopropylidene ketals was studied in detail by vapour phase chromatography {{so as to}} determine the reaction sequence. The ketals observed in this study have been prepared and further investigated by proton magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The {{formation of}} the acetals of <b>D-glucitol</b> and 1 -deoxy-D-glucitol were studied previously and shown to exhibit kinetic and thermodynamic control. Similar control had been observed with 2 -deoxy-D-glucitol and n-butyraldehyde giving the 1, 3 -acetal as the kinetically controlled product and the 3, 4 - acetal(s) as the thermodynamically controlled product. A detailed study of the mechanism {{of the formation of}} the mono-acetals of <b>D-glucitol</b> has been attempted. <b>D-Glucitol</b> is known to give the 2, 3 acetal(s) as its kinetically controlled product. It would be expected that hemi-acetal formation, which must be the initial step in the reaction sequence, would occur at a primary hydroxyl and in particular at C 1, so that initial cyclisation occurs with the formation of the 1, 2 -acetals or less probably the 1, 3 -acetal. Direct hemi-acetal formation has been possible with diols and triols but with hexitols alternative electrophiles have been used, chlorethers and vinylethers. These would seem to indicate hemiacetal formation is occurring at C 1 hydroxyl, but that hemiscetals undergo intermolecular rearrangment to the subsequent products the 2, 3 and 2, 4 mono-acetals. This together with hydrolysis atudies on the 1, 2; 3, 4; 2, 4; 2, 4; 5, 6 and 4, 6 mono-acetals of <b>D-glucitol,</b> shows that {{it is unlikely that the}} 1, 2 acetal or the others investigated are kinetic intermediates, since their stabilities towards hydrolysis are too high. Synthetic investigations on equi-molar solutions of n-butyraldehyde and D-gluoitol using various substrate concentrations, couple with a mathematical approach to the reaction mechanism suggest that the overall mechanism involving kinetic and thermodynamic control is goverened by both intra and an inter-molecular processes. <p...|$|E

Cells with a constitutive synthesis of all hexitol transport systems but with low P-HPr levels have very low transport and phosphorylating activities in vivo, although 40 to 90 % of the enzyme II-complex activities are detected in cell extracts of such mutants. No indications for additional hexitol transport systems, especially for systems able to transport and accumulate free hexitols as in Klebsiella aerogenes, have been found. Substrate Km, and Vmax of the three transport systems for several hexitols and hexitol analogues have been determined by growth rates, transport activities, and in vitro phosphorylating activities.

The new reagent is readily applicable to the postcolumn detection of polyols and sugars after high-performance liquid chromatography and is linear over the range 40 - 180 nmol for <b>d-glucitol</b> (sorbitol) and 10 - 300 nmol for glucose, using standard HPLC equipment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA gene in Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, {{annotated}} as a ribitol dehydrogenase (RDH), had 87 % sequence identity (97 % positives) to the N-terminal 31 {{amino acids}} of an l-glucitol dehydrogenase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia DSMZ 14322. The 729 -bp long RDH gene coded for a protein consisting of 242 amino acids with a molecular mass of 26. 1 kDa. The heterologously expressed protein not only exhibited the main enantio selective activity with <b>d-glucitol</b> oxidation to d-fructose but also converted l-glucitol to d-sorbose with enzymatic cofactor regeneration and a yield of 90 %. The temperature stability and the apparent K (m) value for l-glucitol oxidation let the enzyme {{appear as a}} promising subject for further improvement by enzyme evolution. We propose to rename the enzyme from the annotated RDH gene (locus tag bll 6662) from B. japonicum USDA as a d-sorbitol dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 14) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} and hydrogenation of cellobiose (4 -O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucose) in ZnCl 2 _ 4 H 2 O solvent was {{studied to}} optimize the conditions for conversion of lignocellulose (the most abundant renewable resource) into sorbitol (<b>D-glucitol).</b> Water at neutral pH does not allow hydrolysis of cellobiose under {{the conditions of the}} experiments (up to 125 1 C, 4 h), but relatively fast hydrogenation of cellobiose into 3 -b-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucitol over a Ru/C catalyst in the presence of H 2 takes place. In ZnCl 2 _ 4 H 2 O hydrolysis does take place in the range of temperatures studied (75 – 125 1 C) and simultaneously hydrogenation (H 2, Ru/C), though at a lower rate than that in neutral water. Thus, a one-pot conversion of cellobiose into sorbitol is possible. The hydrolysis is the rate limiting reaction, but the selectivity to sorbitol is determined by the rate of hydrogenation. Under optimal conditions the yield of sorbitol is Z 95 %. The kinetic pathways are discussed. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{reflection}} and surface tension {{have been used}} to study the adsorption of the nonionic surfactant monododecyl hexaethylene glycol (C 12 E 6) and the mixed nonionic-anionic surfactants n-dodecyl triethylene glycol (C 12 E 3) and Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at the air-liquid interface. Water and a sorbitol (<b>d-glucitol,</b> CH 2 OH(HCOH) 4 CH 2 OH) /water mixture were selected as the solvents. The addition of 300 g/liter of sorbitol to an aqueous solution of C 12 E 6 reduces the critical micellar concentration, cmc, from ~ 7 x 10 - 5 to ~ 3 x 10 - 5 M, and increases the surface pressure at the cmc; the effect on the C 12 E 3 /SDS mixture is less. Despite these changes, the pattern of adsorption at the air-liquid interface is essentially unaltered by the addition of sorbitol, and the surface tension and neutron reflectivity data are in good agreement. The consequences of the sorbitol addition are however seen directly {{in the structure of the}} C 12 E 6 monolayer. The ethylene oxide (EO) chain is more extended than in water, and more displaced from the solvent, consistent with dehydration of the ethylene oxide group...|$|E
40|$|L-Sorbose {{degradation}} in Klebsiella pneumoniae {{was shown}} to follow the pathway L-sorbose leads to L-sorbose- 1 -phosphate leads to D-glucitol- 6 -phosphate leads to D-fructose- 6 -phosphate. Transport and phosphorylation of L-sorbose was catalyzed by membrane-bound enzyme IIsor of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system, specific for and regulated by this ketose and different from all other enzymes II described thus far. Two soluble enzymes, an L-sorbose- 1 -phosphate reductase and a D-glucitol- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, {{were involved in the}} conversion of L-sorbose- 1 -phosphate to D-fructose- 6 -phosphate. This dehydrogenase was temperature sensitive, preventing growth of wild-type strains of K. pneumoniae at temperatures above 35 degrees C in the presence of L-sorbose. The enzyme was distinct from a second D-glucitol- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase involved in the metabolism of <b>D-glucitol.</b> The sor genes were transferred from the chromosome of nonmotile strains of K. pneumoniae by means of a new R'sor+ plasmid to motile strains of Escherichia coli K- 12. Such derivatives not only showed the temperature-sensitive Sor+ phenotype characteristic for K. pneumoniae or Sor+ wild-type strains of E. coli, but also reacted positively to sorbose in chemotaxis tests...|$|E
40|$|Ketose reductase (NAD-dependent polyol {{dehydrogenase}} EC 1. 1. 1. 14) activity, which catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of fructose to sorbitol (<b>d-glucitol),</b> was detected in developing maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm, purified 104 -fold from this tissue, and partially characterized. Product analysis by high performance liquid chromatography {{confirmed that the}} enzyme-catalyzed reaction was freely reversible. In maize endosperm, 15 days after pollination, ketose reductase activity was of the same order of magnitude as sucrose synthase activity, which produces fructose during sucrose degradation. Other enzymes of hexose metabolism detected in maize endosperm were present in activities of only 1 to 3 % of the sucrose synthase activity. CaCl 2, MgCl 2, and MnCl 2 stimulated ketose reductase activity 7 -, 6 -, and 2 -fold, respectively, but {{had little effect on}} NAD-dependent polyol dehydrogenation (the reverse reaction). The pH optimums for ketose reductase and {{polyol dehydrogenase}} reactions were 6. 0 and 9. 0, respectively. Km values were 136 millimolar fructose and 8. 4 millimolar sorbitol. The molecular mass of ketose reductase was estimated to be 78 kilodaltons by gel filtration. It is postulated that ketose reductase may function to metabolize some of the fructose produced during sucrose degradation in maize endosperm, but the metabolic fate of sorbitol produced by this reaction is not known...|$|E
40|$|After {{removal of}} tightly bound NAD+ by using charcoal, a {{preparation}} of d-glucose 6 -phosphate– 1 l-myoinositol 1 -phosphate cyclase catalysed {{the reduction of}} 5 -keto-d-glucitol 6 -phosphate and 5 -keto-d-glucose 6 -phosphate by [4 - 3 H]NADH to give [5 - 3 H]-glucitol 6 -phosphate and [5 - 3 H]glucose 6 -phosphate respectively. The position of the tritium atom in the latter was shown by degradation. Both enzyme-catalysed reductions were strongly inhibited by 2 -deoxy-d-glucose 6 -phosphate, a powerful competitive inhibitor of inositol cyclase. The charcoal-treated enzyme preparation also converted 5 -keto-d-glucose 6 -phosphate into [3 H]myoinositol 1 -phosphate {{in the presence of}} [4 - 3 H]NADH, but less effectively. These partial reactions of inositol cyclase are interpreted as providing strong evidence for the formation of 5 -keto-d-glucose 6 -phosphate as an enzyme-bound intermediate in the conversion of d-glucose 6 -phosphate into 1 l-myoinositol 1 -phosphate. The enzyme was partially inactivated by NaBH 4 in the presence of NAD+. Glucose 6 -phosphate did not increase the inactivation, and there was no inactivation in the absence of NAD+. There was no evidence for Schiff base formation during the cyclization. <b>d-Glucitol</b> 6 -phosphate (l-sorbitol 1 -phosphate) was a good inhibitor of the overall reaction. It did not inactivate the enzyme. The apparent molecular weight of inositol cyclase as determined by Sephadex chromatography was 2. 15 × 105...|$|E
40|$|Sugar {{alcohols}} (polyols) {{are used}} in food manufacturing and in medical tests and examinations. <b>d-Glucitol</b> (sorbitol) and d-mannitol were previously the most common alditols used for these purposes. After the 1960 s, xylitol became a common ingredient in noncariogenic confectioneries, oral hygiene products, and diabetic food. Erythritol, a polyol of the tetritol type, {{can be regarded as}} the sweetener of the “next generation. ” The disaccharide polyols maltitol, lactitol, and isomalt have also been used in food manufacturing and in medical tests. Consumption of pentitol- and hexitol-type polyols and disaccharide polyols may cause gastrointestinal disturbances at least in unaccustomed subjects. The occurrence of disturbances depends on consumer properties and on the molecular size and configuration of the polyol molecule. Adaptation may take place as a result of enzyme induction in the intestinal flora. Some of the literature on xylitol has been difficult to access by health-care professionals and will be reviewed here. Research and clinical field experience have found no pathology in polyol-associated osmotic diarrhea—the intestinal mucosa having normal basic structure, except in extreme instances. Xylitol is better tolerated than hexitols or the disaccharide polyols. Erythritol, owing to its smaller molecular weight and configuration that differ from other alditols, normally avoids the gastrointestinal reactions encountered with other polyols. This review will also touch upon the FODMAPs diet concept...|$|E
40|$|Amikacin resistance, rare among nocardiae, was {{observed}} in 58 clinical isolates of nocardiae. All of these isolates hydrolyzed hypoxanthine, and 75 to 100 % utilized citrate, D-galactose, and D-trehalose as sole carbon sources. Based on utilization of I-erythritol, <b>D-glucitol,</b> i-myo-inositol, D-mannitol, and ribitol and susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, the 58 isolates were separable into four groups. One group was negative for I-erythritol and ribitol and included all the isolates belonging to Nocardia asteroides complex antibiogram type IV. The remaining three groups were positive for I-erythritol and ribitol and were grouped within Nocardia transvalensis. The group that included the type strain was designated N. transvalensis sensu stricto, {{and the other two}} groups were designated new taxons 1 and 2. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of a 439 -bp segment of the 65 -kDa heat shock protein gene with XhoI and HinfI produced identical patterns for 53 (91 %) and 58 (100 %) isolates, respectively, and differentiated them from all other Nocardia taxa. NarI- and HaeIII-derived RFLP patterns clearly differentiated each of the four biochemically defined taxa. These four groups were also distinguishable by using the chromogenic substrates in Dade MicroScan test panels. By high-performance liquid chromatography, these isolates exhibited the same unique mycolic acid-ester elution patterns that differed from those of all other clinically significant nocardiae. Gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of fatty acids also produced similar patterns for all isolates that distinguished them from all other Nocardia taxa, but did not differentiate the four taxa within the complex. We propose the designation N. transvalensis complex for these four groups of nocardiae, pending further genetic evaluation...|$|E

The previously unknown butylidene acetals, 2, 4 - 0 -butylidene-D-glucitol, 3, 4 - 0 -butylidene-D-glucitol, and 1, 3 : 2, 4 -di-O-butylidene-b-glucitol, have been isolated, together with syrupy di-O-butylidene- and tri-O-butylidene-D-glucitols of unknown composition. 2, 4 - 0 -lsobutylidene-D-glucitol and a syrupy tri-O-isobutylidene-h-glucitol have also been prepared by similar methods. All the crystalline compounds have been characterised and systematic structural studies have been made upon them, The structures of the 2, 4 monoacetals have been established, and the structure of the crystalline dl-O-butylidene-D-glucitol has been indicatedby partial hydrolysis, after it had been established that it was a 1, 2, 3, 4 diacetal. Kinetic studies have been made on the hydrolysis of various monoacetals of <b>D-glucitol</b> in hydrochloric acid of varying strength. It has been shown that the stabilities of the 2, 4 -, 3, 4 -, and 4, 6 -O-butylidene-D-glucitols do not differ significantly from one another. It has also been shown that these three monoacetals, and possibly further cyclic acetals, exist in equilibrium with each other in aqueous hydrochloric acid. The Arrhenius energies of activation and frequency factors have been determined for 2, 4 - 0 -butylidene-D-glucitol and 2, 4 - 0 -isobutylidene-D-glucitol, in N and 2 N hydrochloric acid.
