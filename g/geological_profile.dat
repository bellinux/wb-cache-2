50|$|Coffey Geotechnics {{supported}} by AECOM were awarded the tender for geotechnical drilling services in August 2011, and drilling began on 7 September 2011. A drilling rig {{was set up}} in a park opposite the Castle Towers shopping centre at Castle Hill, where one of the underground stations will be built. At least 150 boreholes with a diameter of up to 15 cm will be drilled up to 75 m deep along the proposed alignment between Epping and Rouse Hill in order to develop an understanding of the <b>geological</b> <b>profile.</b> The drilling is anticipated to take about 9 weeks to complete.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{protection}} plan is to secure the important <b>geological</b> <b>profile</b> and preserve it for future study. Klonk is mainly threatened by amateur palaeontologists who expect a rich locality, however the location is important mainly due to microfossils. Another threat is the overgrowing of vegetation, which has been successfully removed mechanically and by herbicides in the past. The removal of unwanted vegetation should also help {{the return of the}} original vegetation, which used to be strongly influenced by pasture. Plans for the future include marking of borders of the protected area in order to facilitate management, since it lies on parts of two private properties.|$|E
50|$|The <b>geological</b> <b>profile</b> of Doñana National Park {{reflects}} the development over {{several hundred thousand}} years of a deep aquifer and geomorphological features that have enhanced the biodiversity of the wildlife habitats presently found there. After {{the end of the}} last glacial period, the area was covered by freshwater and brackish marshes, ponds and sand dunes, with some marine intrusions caused by high-energy events such as tsunamis and large storms. A period of comparatively rapid rise in global sea level during the first part of the Flandrian interglacial was associated with the melting of the paleoglaciers, and reached its maximum level 6,500-7,000 years ago. At this time, Doñana National Park and the surrounding areas were flooded, and a lagoon, later called Lacus Ligustinus by the Romans, was formed. The pace of infilling of the lagoon has increased over the last 6,000 years, along with accelerated growth of sandspits and the creation of new inland marshes and wetlands. The extensive marshes of Doñana National Park now have a flat topography, with some inland depressions occupied by temporary or permanent wetlands, locally called 'lucios'. The whole area is protected by the Doñana spit, a wide sandy littoral barrier with mobile dune systems growing toward the southeast.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to proof any correlation between soil moisture content and electrical resistivity values and to determine at what level of soil moisture content which will be the best condition to conduct ERT survey.

40|$|In August 1996, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio was {{contracted}} by {{the city}} of New Braunfels to conduct archaeological investigations prior to planned development of vacant city property. The plan called {{for the construction of a}} parking lot in close proximity to site 41 CM 25, an Archaic-period cemetery. The investigation was to determine whether the proposed construction would impact site 41 CM 25 or other prehistoric and/or historic features. CAR staff conducted a pedestrian survey of the project area, shovel tested in the footprint of the proposed parking lot, and monitored tree stump removals and subsurface grading necessary for the parking lot construction. In addition, two backhoe trenches were excavated and one <b>geological</b> <b>profile</b> was described. The testing and monitoring uncovered various prehistoric and historic artifacts in good archaeological and geological contexts. Most of the artifacts were prehistoric and included chert flakes, cores, mussel shell, and fire-cracked rock. One diagnostic artifact-a Pedemales point-was uncovered, tentatively assigning the site to the Middle Archaic period. The results of the <b>geological</b> <b>profile,</b> in conjunction with background research, suggest that the project area is located on the edge of a distinctive geological zone in which the burial site of 41 CM 25 is located. The testing and monitoring concluded that numerous buried cultural deposits are located in the project area and that the presence of buried cultural features is also highly probable. However, due to the relatively shallow depth required for the footings of the parking lot, these deposits and features will not be significantly impacted by the construction process. In addition, the close proximity of the project area to the existing site 41 CM 25, combined with the geological evidence, suggests that this area is one contiguous site. Therefore, we recommend that the boundaries of site 41 CM 25 be extended to include the project area and that any future development of 41 CM 25 and/or the project area be closely monitored and evaluated by archaeologists...|$|E

30|$|Development of the hydrogeological {{characteristics}} of the Voltaian rocks is based primarily on linking the observed water bearing capacity of the boreholes to the actual lithology and stratigraphy of the rocks penetrated by the boreholes. Therefore, reliability of the borehole records including the construction details and the <b>geological</b> <b>profile</b> is fundamental. This study raises doubt about the reliability of this information and indicates need for improvement. In addition, diagnosing poor well performance requires {{a good understanding of}} the completion actually in place, rather than the one that was planned. Most probably, it is the productivity of many boreholes in the country compromised by poor depth control of screen settings, combined with inadequate gravel pack material. Accordingly, independent drilling supervision should be strengthened and borehole logging at least of a few and randomly selected boreholes could be made {{as an integral part of}} all government drilling projects in the country, with the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA) being responsible to enforce the practice.|$|E
