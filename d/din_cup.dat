5000|$|In 1890 Aldridge, {{who was a}} keen {{follower}} of the turf, decided to establish a stud farm. He purchased the Sydney stallion Carlyon for 1,000 guineas, and a dozen brood mares, including Brown Alice, Queensdale, Tuberose, Thora, Atholine, Queen of Nations, and Sylvan Queen. He secured a property [...] "Richmond Park" [...] off Richmond Road, South Australia, later {{to become part of}} West Beach Airport, and quickly {{made a name for himself}} as a breeder, and Carlyon soon won fame as a sire, for a time topping the winning sires' list in South Australia. Among his progeny were St. David, Carlton, winner of a Newmarket Handicap, Gunga <b>Din</b> (Adelaide <b>Cup),</b> Antilles (City Handicap and Birthday Cup), Lord Carlyon (Goodwood Handicap), Dirk Hammerhand (S.A. St. Leger), Troubridge (Fulham Park Plate), St. Vincent and Aline (Fulham Park Plate), Rienzi (S.A. Derby), Bay Lavender (A.R.C. Grand National Hurdles).|$|R
60|$|We {{discovered}} {{and enjoyed the}} only true Bohemia. Every day and night we repaired {{to one of those}} palaces of marble and glass and tilework, where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life. Valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous. The classic marble on which we ate, the great, light-flooded, vitreous front, adorned with snow-white scrolls; the grand Wagnerian <b>din</b> of clanking <b>cups</b> and bowls, the flashing staccato of brandishing cutlery, the piercing recitative of the white-aproned grub-maidens at the morgue-like banquet tables; the recurrent lied-motif of the cash-register--it was a gigantic, triumphant welding of art and sound, a deafening, soul-uplifting pageant of heroic and emblematic life. And the beans were only ten cents. We wondered why our fellow-artists cared to dine at sad little tables in their so-called Bohemian restaurants; and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their presence.|$|R
