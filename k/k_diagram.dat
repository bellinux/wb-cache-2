40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty six long-period red {{variable}} {{stars in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the three year MOA project database were analysed. A careful periodic analysis was performed on these stars and a catalogue of their magnitudes, colours, periods and amplitudes is presented. We convert our blue and red magnitudes to $K$ band values using 19 oxygen-rich stars. A group of red short-period stars separated from the Mira sequence has been found on a (log P, <b>K)</b> <b>diagram.</b> They are located at the short period side of the Mira sequence consistent {{with the work of}} Wood and Sebo (1996). There are two interpretations for such stars; a difference in pulsation mode or a difference in chemical composition. We investigated the properties of these stars together with their colour, amplitude and periodicity. We conclude that they have small amplitudes and less regular variability. They are likely to be higher mode pulsators. A large scatter has been also found on the long period side of the (log P, <b>K)</b> <b>diagram.</b> This is possibly a systematic spread given that the blue band of our photometric system covers both standard B and V bands and affects carbon-rich stars.

40|$|International audienceIn {{underwater}} acoustics, {{shallow water}} environments (d < 200 m) act as dispersive waveguide when considering lowfrequency sources (f < 250 Hz), and propagation {{is described by}} modal theory. Propagated signals are usually multicomponent, and the group delay of each mode (each component) is dispersive and varies with mode number. The waveguide dispersion is characterized by modal wavenumbers, which are widely used as inputs of inversion algorithms to estimate environmental properties. Considering a horizontal array and a source along the axis of the array, wavenumber estimation is equivalent to spectral analysis in the range dimension. A large number of hydrophones (i. e. range samples) is thus required to perform an accurate wavenumber (i. e. spectral) estimation. This paper proposes an original approach for estimating the wavenumbers using a short array and a broadband low-frequency source. The wavenumbers are tracked in the frequency-wavenumber (f −k) domain using particle filtering. The waveguide physics provides generic system and state equations to model the f − <b>k</b> <b>diagram.</b> In particular, {{it is possible to}} define an iterative relationship for wavenumber at two consecutive frequencies using the dispersion relation, which holds true in every waveguide.

40|$|Yellow {{symbiotic}} {{stars are}} useful targets for probing whether mass transfer {{has happened in}} their binary systems. However, the number of known yellow symbiotic stars is very scarce. We report spectroscopic observations of five candidate yellow symbiotic stars that were selected by their positions in the 2 MASS (J - H) versus (H - <b>K)</b> <b>diagram</b> and which were included in some emission-line catalogs. Among the five candidates, only StHα 63 is identified as a new yellow symbiotic star because of its spectrum and {{its position in the}} [TiO]-[TiO] diagram, which indicates a K 4 -K 6 spectral type. In addition, the derived electron density (∼ 10 cm) and several emission-line intensity ratios provide further support for that classification. The other four candidates are rejected as symbiotic stars because three of them actually do not show emission lines and the fourth one only Balmer emission lines. We also found that the WISE W 3 -W 4 index clearly separates normal K-giants from yellow symbiotic stars and therefore can be used as an additional tool for selecting candidate yellow symbiotic stars.

40|$|Outside of {{the known}} star {{clusters}} in the Galactic Center, {{a large number of}} evolved massive stars have been detected; but their origins remain uncertain. We present a spectroscopic study of eight such stars, based on new Gemini GNIRS and NIFS near-infrared observations. This work has led to the discovery of a new O If+ star. We compare the reddening-corrected J-K vs <b>K</b> <b>diagram</b> for our stars with the massive ones in the Arches cluster and use stellar evolutionary tracks to constrain their ages and masses. The radial velocities of both the stars and their nearby H II regions are also reported. All of the stars are blueshifted relative to the Arches cluster by > 50 km/s. We find that our source P 35 has a velocity consistent with that of the surrounding molecular gas. The velocity gradient of nearby ionized gas along the Gemini GNIRS long slit, relative to P 35 and the adjacent - 30 - 0 km/s molecular cloud, can best be explained by a pressure-driven flow model. Thus, P 35 most likely formed in situ. Three more of our stars have radial velocities different from their adjacent molecular gas, indicating that they are interlopers. The four stars closest to the Arches cluster have similar spectra, ages and masses to known cluster members, suggesting that they were likely ejected from the cluster via three-body interactions. Therefore, we find that the relatively isolated stars partly formed in situ and partly were ejected from the known star clusters in the Galactic Center.

The field is centered on the embedded cluster RCW 108 –IR and includes {{a large portion of the}} open cluster NGC 6193. We detect over 420 X-ray sources in the field and combined these data with deep near-IR, Spitzer/IRAC and Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) mid-IR data. We find about 360 of the X-ray sources have near-IR counterparts. We divide the region into five parts based on the X-ray point source characteristics and extended 8 µm emission. The most clearly defined regions are the central region, identified by embedded sources with high luminosities in the both the near-IR and X-ray as well as high X-ray temperatures (∼ 3 keV), and the eastern region, identified by low extinction and ∼ 1 keV X-ray temperatures. Other regions, identified by their directional relationship to RCW 108 –IR, are less uniform— representing combinations of the first two regions, independent star formation epochs, or both.

We have made linear pulsation models for the pulsating stars in these clusters taking into account variations in mass and helium abundance. Reliable periods have been determined for 11 LPVs in NGC 362 and 15 LPVs in NGC 2808.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the faintest known proper motion members of the Pleiades star cluster. The primary aim of the work is an attempt to determine whether the lowest mass members of the cluster are brown dwarfs. A brief introduction outlines the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs and discusses the relation of research in this area to other branches of astronomy. The second chapter describes the basic principles of astronomical photometry and spectroscopy, the instruments used and the methods of data reduction. Chapter three gives a review of the current theory and observations of brown dwarfs. The results are presented in chapters four, five and six. RIJHK photometry for a sample of 62 objects is presented. The 1, 1 - <b>K</b> <b>diagram</b> is shown to be a good discriminant of binary status for low mass cluster objects and using this diagram two single brown dwarf candidates and seven potential brown dwarf containing binaries are identified. FOS optical spectroscopy of 31 objects is used in an investigation of temperature indicators for cool stars. In addition gravity sensitive features indicate that the surface gravity of the Pleiades objects is lower than equivalent main sequence objects. Also discussed are the chromospheric and coronal activity of cluster members, and evidence is presented showing a turnover in both at ~ 0. 3 M⊕, where the objects become fully convective. CGS 4 1 - 2. 5 micron spectra are used in a futher investigation of methods of determining effective temperature and in searching for evidence of low mass companions. One object shows evidence for a low mass companion of ~ 0. 035 M⊕.
