It is already guaranteed: After doing the symmetric difference for a path, {{none of its}} vertices could be considered again just because the Dist will not be equal to Dist + 1 (It would be exactly Dist).|$|E
25|$|If M and N are two smooth manifolds, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> {{define the}} jet of a {{function}} ? We could perhaps attempt to define such a jet by using local coordinates on M and N. The disadvantage {{of this is}} that jets cannot thus be defined in an equivariant fashion. Jets do not transform as tensors. Instead, jets of functions between two manifolds belong to a jet bundle.|$|E
25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely {{where and how}} do the mathematical entities exist, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E

25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
500|$|The reappearance of Nick Lane and his storyline helped resolve {{an earlier}} plot point from [...] "Over There," [...] {{in which he}} was {{recognized}} by Fringe agent Lincoln Lee before dying. Noble noted that [...] "Worlds Apart' {{and the rest of the}} fourth season brought back a number of characters from the series' [...] "rich history", including Sally, Nick, and David Robert Jones. [...] "This episode," [...] he commented, [...] "is bringing those things back together for us as we face the decision of what to do. Do we keep the worlds together? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> keep them together without creating the monster that is happening? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> stop this monster from happening?

In this debut story, Fritz brings a young female cat home and strips all her clothes off before getting {{on top of}} her to pick fleas off of her. Preceding the publication of the story, Kurtzman sent Crumb a letter which read, [...] "Dear R. Crumb, we think the little pussycat drawings you sent us were just great. Question is, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> print them without going to jail?" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|E
500|$|British Trotskyite publication, the Socialist Review, praised Chomsky's {{discussion}} {{of the impact of}} neoliberalism in the US, however they asserted that [...] "when it comes to crucial questions - <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> fight and what are we fighting for - Chomsky's response is lacking." [...] They assert that his claims that communities can challenge the Republican and Democrat domination of the electoral system are [...] "somewhat bizarre" [...] given that he has already established how [...] "corrupt and biased" [...] that system is. Criticising him for not looking at the concept of a potential revolution, they also express disagreement with his view that the [...] "solution for the 99%" [...] can be found within [...] "the framework of capitalism".|$|E

(b) <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> reconcile the Penn Treebank annotation principles and practices with the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) traditional and more recent grammatical concepts?

500|$|The {{session was}} {{interrupted}} constantly, with people entering the building, phoning them, or throwing things through the window. Eventually, when the filming crew left the room, the group managed {{to finish the}} song. Stannards commented about the inspiration behind it to Music Week: [...] "We were talking about Bollywood films, the colours and how the Spice Girls could present themselves. It {{was a matter of}} <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> get everything in to one song?" [...] All the writing and the vocal recording was completed in one afternoon, and instead of taking turns, the five members went inside the vocal booths and recorded the chorus together. Brown commented that for this reason the final mix sounds [...] "spontaneous and full of energy".|$|E
500|$|Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 {{that there}} would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what {{happened}} to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director on the contingent that the story was interesting enough. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone. Lawrence stated, [...] "... the tough thing is, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> do that again and in a different way?" [...] In May 2011, Francis Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, [...] "I don't think that's ever going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|There were, however, some {{mixed reviews}} of [...] "Best Mistake". Idolator's Kathy Iandoli {{described}} it as [...] "the average looking cousin of their previous duet [...] "Right There"". Reviewing for Slant Magazine, Andrew Chan said it [...] "makes the mistake of hemming her into her frail middle register, where she has a habit of delivering every word {{as if it were}} a pout." [...] Big Sean's appearance on [...] "Best Mistake" [...] also got varied reception. Pitchfork Media's Meaghan Garvey said his rap on the track made [...] "a mockery of the song's serious tone with hysterically awful lines like [...] "How can we keep the feelings fresh/ <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> Ziploc it?"" [...] Lipshutz found his verse [...] "unnecessary, yet [...] has morphed into an interesting confessional now that the dating rumors are on." [...] Sawdey called it a [...] "pretty outstanding verse," [...] with [...] "his own voice never overpowering the sparse atmosphere, his rhymes measured and metered in a way that fits the song perfectly", while James Shotwell of Under the Gun Review said [...] "Grande is a treat, but I think it's Big Sean who steals the show." ...|$|E
40|$|Most Americans {{learn in}} school that an {{independent}} press {{is necessary for}} democratic self-governance, but rarely <b>do</b> <b>we</b> stop to reflect on what this means. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> as a society determine media’s primary democratic role? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> decide upon media institutions’ obligations to the public? In short, how was {{the relationship between the}} state, the public, and media constructed? And how has this relationship changed over time? Such inquiries require historical analyses, a retracing of policy trajectories, ideas, and discourses to moments before received assumptions about media’s normative role took on an air of inevitability. This paper draws from archival materials to reflect on past struggles to change the American media system, with the aim to help inform future trajectories for media reform...|$|R

500|$|After {{reading the}} first draft, Spotnitz and Carter decided to {{reintroduce}} Donnie Pfaster, a character {{from the second}} season episode [...] "Irresistible". Carter noted that, [...] "we had talked about possibly revisiting some old monster this season, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity." [...] The writers and producers decided to take [...] "Orison" [...] in a [...] "substantial new direction". Although Donnie Pfaster was originally portrayed as a [...] "death fetishist", his nature was non-supernatural. In [...] "Orison", however, {{it was decided to}} make Pfaster into a true demon. Shiban explained [...] "we decided late in the process to turn him into this totally demonic character, essentially evil as an entity." [...] Spotnitz was very excited about bringing closure to the Pfaster-Scully story. He explained, [...] "For me, what really justified bringing Donnie back was the final act of the script when Donnie comes for Scully and she ends up shooting him full of holes." [...] The final scene, however, proved difficult to script. Director Rob Bowman noted, that the act [...] "was a tough scene. Frank and I had spoken on the phone about the dialogue in the wrap-up scene with Mulder and Scully. Even though she shot him in the heightened state, you couldn't deny the fact that she killed Donnie Psaster [...] in cold blood. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> deal with that?" ...|$|E
500|$|US President Barack Obama {{stated in}} June 2012: [...] "Right now, [...] focus {{has to be}} on {{strengthening}} their overall banking system...making a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that the banking system is solid... In addition, they're {{going to have to look}} at how do they achieve growth at the same time as they're carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish. So countries like Spain and Italy, for example, have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary—everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues. But they've got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed. And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure—ironically, that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term... n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root." ...|$|E
500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E
