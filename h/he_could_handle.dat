When he and Roth pitched The Man with the Iron Fists to producers, RZA used the short film {{to prove that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the martial arts action and be trusted to take on his first directing role. On May 7, 2010, Universal Pictures announced it had agreed to finance and distribute the film, which Roth and Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman would produce. The producers gave RZA a $20 million budget.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion was}} mostly {{opposed to the}} strike and {{supported}} Cleveland's actions. Republicans and eastern Democrats supported Cleveland (the leader of the northeastern pro-business wing of the party), but southern and western Democrats as well as Populists generally denounced him. Governor John Peter Altgeld of Illinois, a Democrat, denounced Cleveland and said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> all disturbances in his state without federal intervention.|$|E
25|$|On September 29, 1945, King reorganized the Navy, {{eliminating}} the COMINCH position {{and leaving the}} CNO as the undisputed uniformed head of the Navy. Under the reorganization, which became effective on October 10, 1945, Edwards became VCNO while Horne was temporarily retained as a {{special assistant to the}} CNO so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> demobilization and logistic rollback issues. Horne was placed on the retired list on August 1, 1946, but remained on active duty as special assistant and head of the Board of Review for Decorations and Medals until April 1947.|$|E

25|$|Sir Alan soon told Ruth {{she was in}} {{no danger}} of being fired and instead merely asked for her opinion on who should go, to which she stated that, despite being disorganised and taking on more than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handled,</b> Syed's passion was inspiring to those around him, and Tuan should be fired as he lacked this. In {{addition}} to her comments, Syed was credited to closing a deal with punters off the street that he managed to draw into the office.|$|R

25|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to join the}} Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Despite Ponting's reluctance to weigh into the debate, Tasmanian coach Greg Shipperd thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the experience. The selectors ended up choosing Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August–September 1993. Australian success was limited, with only several wins. No batsman scored a century, despite Ponting reaching 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the aggregates, behind Langer.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1853, Thomas A. Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company {{employed}} Carnegie as a secretary/telegraph operator at {{a salary}} of $4.00 per week ($125.00 in 2017 dollars). Carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company. At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country. As superintendent Carnegie made {{a salary of}} fifteen hundred dollars a year ($47,000 in 2017). His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania {{was one of the}} largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.|$|E
500|$|Pickett {{today is}} widely {{perceived}} as being a tragic hero of sorts—a flamboyant officer who wanted to lead his troops into a glorious battle, but always missed the opportunity until the disastrous charge at Gettysburg. Historian John C. Waugh wrote of Pickett, [...] "An excellent brigade commander, he never proved <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> a division." [...] He quotes George B. McClellan, the Union general, as saying: [...] "Perhaps {{there is no doubt}} that he was the best infantry soldier developed on either side during the Civil War." ...|$|E

500|$|Governor Cary Hardee was on standby, {{ready to}} order National Guard troops in to {{neutralize}} the situation. Despite his message to the sheriff of Alachua County, Walker informed Hardee by telegram {{that he did not}} fear [...] "further disorder" [...] and urged the governor not to intervene. [...] The governor's office monitored the situation, in part because of intense Northern interest, but Hardee would not activate the National Guard without Walker's request. Walker insisted <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the situation; records show that Governor Hardee took Sheriff Walker's word and went on a hunting trip.|$|E
500|$|Bouwmeester {{was born}} September 27, 1983 in Edmonton, Alberta. He {{is the son}} of Dan and Gena Bouwmeester, and has an elder sister, Jill. His father is a school teacher and coach in Edmonton, and played defence himself for the University of Alberta Golden Bears hockey team. [...] Bouwmeester was a {{naturally}} gifted player; his father said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> a hockey stick at an early age, and learned to skate shortly after he learned to walk. An all-around athlete, Bouwmeester also played baseball and soccer competitively, and ran track, played volleyball and basketball at school. He had natural talent for hockey, however, and learned to play both on a backyard rink his father maintained and {{in the basement of the}} family home.|$|E
500|$|Garfield later {{served under}} Major General Don Carlos Buell at the Battle of Shiloh and under Thomas J. Wood at the Siege of Corinth. Garfield's health {{deteriorated}} {{and he was}} sent to serve on a commission to investigate the conduct of Union general Fitz John Porter. In the spring of 1863, Garfield returned to the field as chief of staff for William S. Rosecrans, commander of the Army of the Cumberland. After the disastrous Chickamauga campaign in September 1863, Rosecrans was relieved of his command. Garfield saved his own reputation by fighting bravely during the battles, and he was subsequently promoted to the rank of major general. Garfield's fame spread, and William Dennison engineered Garfield's 1863 election to Congress. As Whitelaw Reid commented, Garfield was [...] "the most able and prominent of the young politicians who entered the army at the outbreak of the war." [...] Garfield did not want to leave the army, so he personally visited President Abraham Lincoln for advice on the matter. Lincoln told Garfield that he had more generals than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle,</b> and what he needed was political support.|$|E

50|$|The three central {{characters}} {{are surrounded by}} a vivid supporting cast of would-be reformers, cynical journalists, and sometimes sinister hangers-on. James shows remarkable ability to create a broad cross-section of American society, which helps refute the charge that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>handle</b> small, closed-off bits of life.|$|R
50|$|Stahma thanks Nolan {{and when}} she gets home, she blames Alak (Jesse Rath) for what {{happened}} to her, saying that Skevur tried to kill her because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> him properly, which he must do now.

500|$|In casting Al [...] "Gee" [...] Giardello, Levinson {{decided not}} to make the {{character}} Italian-American like the real-life counterpart Gary D'Addario, but rather cast Yaphet Kotto and made the character a Sicilian-African American. Kotto, who turned down two feature film offers to accept the Homicide role, was extremely impressed with Levinson's choices for the character, saying, [...] "They had the daring to make the artistic choice without prejudice of any kind. I don't think there's another network show on the air with this sort of cast composition." [...] Kotto struggled at first with the show's production style and constantly moving camera style, which flustered him and made him forget his lines. Levinson had to personally reassure him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the part. Clark Johnson was cast as Meldrick Lewis, and Jon Polito as his partner, Steve Crosetti. When Polito first auditioned, he read the role of a Polish cop, then did a second reading for an Irish role based on Detective Sergeant Terrence McLarney. He was cast in the McLarney role, but it was rewritten to an Italian character for Polito. The actor found working on Homicide intense and demanding, claiming, [...] "Everybody's working so hard. This is much more of a theater atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Known {{for having}} refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become {{increasingly}} interested in progressive rock sounds {{by the time}} he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. [...] "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' [...] "attitude" [...] and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as [...] "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was [...] "kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's... Todd was cool and he was a producer." [...] Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: [...] "It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed like <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the pace." [...] Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that [...] "the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York".|$|E
500|$|Before the 1966–67 season, Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired. Initially, he {{had wanted}} his old player Frank Ramsey as coach, but Ramsey was too {{occupied}} running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice Bob Cousy declined, stating {{he did not want}} to coach his former teammates, and the third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the often surly Russell. However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, he said yes. On April 16, 1966 Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics followed by a public announcement two days later. Russell thus became the first African American head coach in NBA history, and commented to journalists: [...] "I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it." [...] The Celtics' championship streak ended in his first full season as head coach at eight, however, as Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and overcame the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals. The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, [...] "Great". However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.|$|E

2500|$|Iñárritu cast {{several of}} the leading roles before the film was financed. Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, Iñárritu did not have Keaton in mind, but he had changed his mind by the end: [...] "When I {{finished}} the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy". Iñárritu cast Keaton for his depth {{in a variety of}} acting styles: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy [...] "with a profound depth to both." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cusack and {{the writers}} floated {{the idea that}} Rob could have a {{conversation}} with Bruce Springsteen in his head, inspired by a reference in Hornby's book where the narrator wishes <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> his past girlfriends as well as Springsteen does in his song, [...] "Bobby Jean" [...] on Born in the U.S.A. They never believed they would actually get the musician to appear in the film, but thought putting him in the script would get the studio excited about it. Cusack knew Springsteen socially and called the musician up and pitched the idea. Springsteen asked for a copy of the script and afterwards agreed to do it.|$|E
50|$|After {{these two}} races {{people began to}} {{speculate}} that Massa had returned to his mistake-prone ways of when he first entered F1, and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> F1 cars {{without the help of}} traction control (which had been outlawed {{from the start of the}} 2008 season), but the next race put those thoughts on hold.|$|R

60|$|Stewart muttered an imprecation.

Then as he wheeled he {{came face to face with}} Nels, who had slipped forward out of the crowd.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his grandiose theatrics, Gorgeous George was an accomplished wrestler. [...] While many may have considered him a mere gimmick wrestler, he was actually a very competent freestyle wrestler, having started learning the sport in amateur wrestling as a teenager, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> himself quite well {{if it came to}} a legitimate contest. The great Lou Thesz, who would take the AWA title away from Wagner, and {{who was one of the}} best [...] "legit" [...] wrestlers ever in professional wrestling, displayed some disdain for the gimmick wrestlers. Nevertheless, he admitted that Wagner [...] "could wrestle pretty well", but added that, [...] "he [...] could never draw a fan until he became Gorgeous George." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Red Devil III" [...] was test {{flown by}} Baldwin over Mineola Field. The first flight {{resulted}} in a wreck into a telegraph pole, with no major injuries. The Baldwin School offered flying lessons in the aircraft for $500 (1911 dollars), if the student proved they had life insurance for flight. It was the student's responsibility to also find an insurance broker to provide the policy, {{because there were no}} flight training policies available at that time. [...] Baldwin previously had toured the country in Curtiss aircraft and his own designs. By the time he had produced the [...] "Red Devil", he had more bookings then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle,</b> the [...] "Red Devil" [...] would be advertised in several towns in close proximity, then substitute pilots and aircraft would be flown with full crowds of spectators.

2500|$|The {{type that}} {{replaced}} the B.E.2a and B.E.2b (as {{well as the}} assortment of other types in use at the time) in the reconnaissance squadrons of the RFC in 1915 was the B.E.2c, which had also been designed before the war. The most important difference in the new model was an improvement in stability – a genuinely useful characteristic, especially in aerial photographic work, using the primitive plate cameras of the time, with their relatively long exposures. Unfortunately {{in this case the}} stability was coupled with [...] "heavy" [...] controls and poor manoeuvrability. A suitable engine was not available in sufficient quantities to replace the air-cooled Renault – the RAF 1a being essentially an uprated version of the French engine – so that the improvement in the B.E.2c's performance was less than startling. When bombs were to be carried or maximum endurance was required the observer had to be left behind, so it was still necessary to have him sit over the centre of gravity, in front of the pilot. In this awkward position his view was poor, {{and the degree to which}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> a camera (or, later, a gun) was hampered by the struts and wires supporting the centre section of the top wing. In practice the pilot of a B.E.2c handled the camera, and the observer, when he was armed at all, had a rather poor field of fire to the rear, having, at best, to shoot back over his pilot's head.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of writing, no {{previous}} compilations existed, so finding out what to include required a lot of research. Compounding this was that often existing translations of the poems were either nonexistent or mangled by homophobic censoring (for example, replacement of male pronouns with female ones).
