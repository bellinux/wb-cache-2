40|$|Motivated by many {{practical}} applications {{that have to}} compute {{in the presence of}} uncertainty, we propose a monadic probabilistic language based upon the mathematical notion of sampling function. Our language provides a unified representation scheme for probability distributions, enjoys rich expressiveness, and o#ers high versatility in encoding probability distributions. We also develop a novel style of operational semantics called a <b>horizontal</b> <b>operational</b> semantics, under which an evaluation returns not a single outcome but multiple outcomes. We have preliminary evidence that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>operational</b> semantics improves the ordinary operational semantics with respect to both execution time and accuracy in representing probability distributions...|$|R

[...] <b>Operational</b> <b>objectives</b> are usually set by middle managers for the next six to twelve months based on an organisation’s aim.

50|$|If an {{organisation}} has SMART <b>operational</b> <b>objectives,</b> {{employees can}} be inspired and motivated {{to work harder}} to meet common objectives, as they are measured. By achieving short term goals, employees might feel a great sense of accomplishment and this would help to improve their motivation. According to a research conducted by Rodgers, R. and Je Hunter, management by objectives (MBO) has been shown to increase productivity. <b>Operational</b> <b>objectives</b> also encourage managers to think strategically. In oder to set objectives and plan for the next 6 to 12 months, they need to have a deep understanding of business’s current position. According to Peter Drucker, rewards such as recognition, appreciation and performance-related pay need to be provided for achieving objectives to motivate employees and raise efficiency.|$|R
