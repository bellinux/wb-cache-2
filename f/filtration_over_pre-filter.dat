40|$|Phosphate is {{becoming}} a main water quality determining factor in regions with intensive animal husbandry. The freshwater limits in Flanders are based on phosphate determined by the molybdate reactive P (MRP) method and the certified laboratories have to adhere to ISO protocols (ISO 15681 - 2 : 2003 or ISO 15923 - 1 : 2013). Surprisingly, filtration is not specified in these guidelines and sample preparation procedures range from unfiltered to 0. 45 µm filtration in these certified laboratories. It is well established that MRP includes both free orthophosphate and phosphate associated with colloidal material such as Fe and Al oxyhydroxides while organic P is only weakly included. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare analytical results among certified laboratories and to identify filtration effects on the analytical results. In a round-robin test, ten waters were collected from streams in Flanders and sent to certified laboratories. In addition, the same waters were tested in our laboratory assessing effects of filtration (paper filter, 0. 45 µm, 0. 1 µm) and dialysis (12 - 14 kDa) on MRP. The MRP concentrations in the water samples decreased gradually by <b>filtration</b> <b>over</b> progressively smaller membrane pore sizes and after dialysis. <b>Filtration</b> <b>over</b> a 0. 45 µm membrane filter reduced MRP concentrations to 74 - 84 % of MRP in unfiltered waters with low Fe (2. 5 mg Fe/L).

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} methods for measuring and describing particle size distribution from three different spots in Tilapia recirculating system at University of Life Ccience in Ås, Norway. For this purpose serial <b>filtration</b> <b>over</b> different mesh size and parallel <b>filtration</b> <b>over</b> different mesh size methods were compared. Water samples were taken from before drum filter, after drum filter and after bio-filter (MBBR) and filtrated through eight different mesh size classes and calculated in mg suspended solids per liter (mgSS/l). Serial method is telling about suspended solids between two filter sizes, while parallel method tells about suspended solids bigger of a given filter size. Each filtering method was done three times in three different days. Results of serial filtration showed large difference in mgSS/l between days, especially between 0, 45 – 10 µm. Small particles (< 30 µm) are dominating in both methods. Water before drum filter contains a lot of large particles which are reduced after treatment in the drum filter. First and third days of serial filtration were more effective for the total suspended solids (TSS) after drum filter, unlike the second day which showed no decrease of TSS after drum filter: 9, 71 mgSS/l before drum filter, and 10 mgSS/l after drum filter. In the first day TSS before drum filter was 23, 58 mgSS/l and after drum filter it was reduced to 8, 8 mgSS/l. In the third day experiment showed 27, 73 mgSS/l before drum filter, and 14, 37 mgSS/l after drum filter. Water after Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) resulted in increase of TSS {{in the first two}} days, whilst the third day showed reduction of TSS value. Parallel filtration method can be calculated as comparing samples, same as serial filtration method. This way of calculations of parallel filtration gave negative values for some of the particle size groups which bring into question the accuracy of the method.

40|$|The {{validity}} of the cholesterol nucleation assay rests {{on the assumption that}} all cholesterol crystals are removed {{at the start of the}} assay so that de novo formation of crystals can be studied. In this paper we have tested the {{validity of}} this assumption. Cholesterol crystals were added to supersaturated model bile. Subsequently the mixtures were either filtered over a 0. 22 micron filter or centrifuged at 37 degrees C for 2 h at 100, 000 x g. After ultracentrifugation the isotropic interphase was collected. Using polarized light microscopy no crystals could be visualized in this fraction. However, the nucleation time of the isotropic interphase decreased from 6. 8 +/- 1. 1 days to 1. 8 +/- 0. 2 days (mean +/- S. E., P less than 0. 01, n = 5) when 10 - 100 micrograms/ml crystals were added prior to centrifugation. Similar results were observed when instead of centrifugation the mixtures containing crystals were filtered. After <b>filtration</b> <b>over</b> a 0. 22 micron filter no crystals could be detected in the filtrate. Yet the nucleation time of the filtrate decreased from 6. 4 +/- 0. 7 days to 3. 1 +/- 0. 5 days (mean +/- S. E.) when 10 micrograms/ml cholesterol crystals were added before filtration (n = 10, P less than 0. 01). Since no cholesterol crystals could be detected at the start of the assay the reduction in nucleation time must have been brought about by cholesterol microcrystals that passed through the filter. Supplementation of cholesterol crystals to model bile did not accelerate the nucleation time when the samples were passed over a 0. 02 micron filter, indicating that the size of the microcrystals was larger than 20 nm. The effect of addition of cholesterol crystals prior to <b>filtration</b> <b>over</b> a 0. 22 micron filter was also tested in the crystal growth assay recently developed by Busch et al. ((1990) J.
