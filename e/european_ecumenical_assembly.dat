The process of European integration has not only political implications, but also economic, political, social and religious implications.

There is a visible tendency towards the realization of a unity in diversity, at the same time seeing the obstacles that exist in front of this vision.

40|$|Abstract: The new Europe {{will bring}} {{together}} {{a plurality of}} religions, traditions and cultures. The process of European integration has not only political implications, but also economic, political, social and religious implications. In this context, {{the building of a}} New Europe requires a coherent interreligious dialogue. The perspectives of the world and <b>European</b> <b>ecumenical</b> movement concern the realization of the unity among churches, {{in the spirit of the}} prayer „that Jesus addressed to His Heavenly Father for his disciples and for those who trusted in him to be one ” (The Bible, John, 17, 22) There is a visible tendency towards the realization of a unity in diversity, at the same time seeing the obstacles that exist in front of this vision. A big step forward in Europe was made by the cooperation between CEC and CCEE to organize the <b>European</b> <b>Ecumenical</b> <b>Assemblies</b> and to elaborate the document entitled Charta Oecumenica. The ecumenical dialogue is practically based on the phenomenon of the concentric circles. What is important is in fact how much the parts have in common or how far a Christian denomination has gone from the doctrinal, administrative and juridical point of view. The dialogue is the ideal means in putting face to face the different points of view, in examining the divergences that separate Christians. In the ecumenical dialogue, the seriousness of the engagement and the depth of the problems that require a solution are obvious. The force to end this long an difficult pilgrimage is in „this submission to the will of the Father, repentance and absolute trust in the power of the truth, which is Christ, to reconciliate”...|$|R

50|$|Tourism Concern {{was founded}} in 1988 as an {{informal}} network, linking people around Britain with similar organisations elsewhere in the world. Its instigator and initial co-ordinator, Alison Stancliffe, was motivated by her experiences when teaching and travelling in South East Asia, where she became concerned that tourists were contributing to economic exploitation in poor regions of the world. Early network members included subscribers to a report commissioned by TEN - the Third World Tourism <b>European</b> <b>Ecumenical</b> Network - in 1988, 'The UK and Third World Tourism', also contacts suggested by counterpart organisations in TEN and further afield, e.g.Equitable Tourism Options(Equations)in India.|$|R

50|$|The Constantine the Great Cross was {{a planned}} project of a tourist complex on Vinik hill near Niš, Serbia. It {{would include a}} monumental cross, museum, hotel, amphitheatre and cinema, on 13 {{hectares}} of land. The cross would be the largest in Europe. The cross, dedicated to Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, was planned to be the centre piece of the <b>Ecumenical</b> <b>Assembly,</b> in honour of the 1700th anniversary of Constantine's Edict of Milan, which the city of Niš hosted in 2013. In 2012, the project had not started, although the Serbian Orthodox Church had ceded land to the City of Niš for the construction. The problem lied in that the city government and owners of land between Vinik and Niš had failed to reach agreement on building roads to the complex.|$|R

[...] He worked with Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, to placate the strong {{feelings}} of the German princes against Pope Eugene IV (1383 - 23 February 1447), to overcome their [...] "neutrality" [...] in the last and schismatic phase of the Council of Basel. The Council had taken {{the position that the}} <b>ecumenical</b> <b>assembly</b> of representatives of all the Church was superior to one member of the Church, even if he was Pope. In 1442 Carvajal was again sent along with Nicholas of Cusa by the Pope to the Diet at Frankfurt. [...] Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini was sent to work on behalf of Pope Eugenius at the Council of Basel and to negotiate with Emperor Sigismund, and when the Council was dissolved, he was sent as Legate to Hungary (1442-1444).

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topic of Christian-Muslim {{dialogue}} in some European countries. The first part gives a theoretical understanding of Christian position towards other faiths and the dialogue with them. The author presents some theological questions and practical topics of Christian-Muslim dialogue, because they directly influence, if the Christian community (Church) starts the dialogue or not. This part also introduces to the immigration process of people from Muslim countries to Europe and {{presents the results of}} current sociological surveys, both in relation to their integration and creation of identities, and in relation to changes in Muslim religiosity within European space with the aim to show the variability and inner complexity of the Muslim presence in Europe. By giving an overview of the cooperation of Muslims with European and international institutions in the second part it proves, that the 2001 affairs completely changed their political will for the dialogue with Muslims. By an overview of the cooperation of Muslim groups with <b>European</b> <b>ecumenical</b> organisations and the Roman-Catholic Church it shows the general maturity of the dialogue, but also its limits set by structures and low measure of reflection at the grass-root level. The thesis outlines the current life situation of Muslims in [...] ...|$|R

Participation is limited to these persons, who cannot delegate their voting rights.|$|R
