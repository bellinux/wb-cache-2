40|$|A {{conceptual}} model of simple water level meter {{based on the}} tide gauge’s principle of the stilling well <b>float</b> <b>gauge</b> type has been designed by applying the Wheatstone Bridge (WB) circuit {{as a part of}} measuring device. By using this model it can be found that the change of water level is linearly correlated with the change of electric current reading at the galvanometer of the WB. Furthermore, the accuracy of the meter reading can be improved by adjusting the variable resistor while keeping the balance condition of the WB. The implementation of this model in turn will improve the ability of water level monitoring system in various observation fields...|$|R
50|$|A {{fixed roof}} tank {{is a type}} of storage tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many fixed roof tanks, allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. Fixed roof tanks without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a fixed roof tank can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, <b>float</b> <b>gauges,</b> and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Simmonds {{had become the}} {{exclusive}} British and European licensee for the aircraft fuel gauging systems produced by the Liquidometer Corporation of New York, USA. It soon became apparent from flight tests that measuring fuel quantity with a <b>float</b> <b>gauge</b> was not very useful in an aircraft like a fighter that in combat was seldom in straight and level flight. As part of the company's entry into this market segment, Simmonds had hired a refugee Polish engineer. Between {{the two of them}} they conceived how such measurements might be done electrically thereby providing much greater accuracy, irrespective of an aircraft's flight attitude. They went on to patent and produce such a system, called Pacitor. The first British aircraft to use this system was the country's first jet fighter, called the Meteor, which first saw combat in 1944, chasing and shooting down many German V I unmanned missiles heading for London.|$|R

40|$|An {{account is}} given {{of types of}} {{anaesthetic}} flowmeters, and it is shown that sticking of the flowmeter bobbin due to accumulation of static electricity may cause a flowmeter inaccuracy of 35 per cent as an average. Possible precautions against this cause of error are discussed. When two similar or different materials are brought into close contact or rubbed against each other, electrically charged particles may cross the border-line, so that the two materials accumulate equal, but electrically opposite charges. If the electrical charges persist when the materials are removed from each other, {{the result will be}} accumulation of static electricity. The greater the power of insulation, the greater the risk that the electrical charging is preserved. Consequently static electricity is electrical charges resting at insulators, semiconductors or insulated conductors. Static electricity may be troublesome or even dangerous by reason of mechanical effects (attraction, repulsion) or chemical (thermic) effects. In anaesthesia much effort is directed toward preventing the accumulation of static electricity, mainly with the object of avoiding explosion or fire due to electrostatic sparks, because static electricity is the main cause of anaesthetic explosions (Report of a Working Party on Anaesthetic Explosions, 1956). Static electricity may, however, also cause increased danger in anaesthesia in another way, namely by changing the presumed high accuracy of the dosimeters (flowmeters). This means an in-creased risk of undesirably high concentrations of the anaesthetic gases or harm to the patient because of too low an oxygen tension in the inspired mixture of gas and oxygen. DOSIMETERS IN ANAESTHESIA The flowmeters used in anaesthesia may be classified into wet (hydraulic) and dry (<b>floating</b> <b>gauge</b> and gauge) types (Adriani, 1960). The wet flowmeters depend on the depression of a water column by back pressure of the gas as it passes through a port into the mixing chamber. The dry flowmeters depend on the elevation of a small piston or rotating bobbin in a tapered glass tube by the passage of gas to the mixing chamber or by deflection of an aneroid spring from gases passing a plate connected to the spring (Cullen...|$|R

After 2 October, 2008, (solid line), the water height was measured with newly-installed water pressure gauges (Mini Diver DI- 501; Schlumberger Ltd.), since the original data taken by <b>floating</b> water <b>gauges</b> (gray line) was often saturated when the change in water level exceeded the wire length between the float and pulley (as seen between June and July, 2008).

After precipitation events the water table reduced at an almost linear rate, because the unconfined ground-water was regularly pumped for domestic and agricultural use at Isawa Fan, and the groundwater flowed out eastward to the edge of Isawa Fan. (Water electrical conductivity at Suginodo Spring (circle in Fig. 1) is 220 µS/cm, about four times larger than that at Mizusawa wells (∼ 50 µS/cm), showing that the groundwater flows eastward at Isawa Fan under conditions of domestic and agricultural water pollution.)

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{successful}} silicon wafer bonding technology using gold-silicon eutectic is reported. The wafers, device wafer and cap wafer are bonded in vacuum. Device wafer is terminated {{on the surface}} with a bond layer that can be single crystal silicon, a layer of polysilicon, gold or any other suitable metal, dielectric or semiconductor layer, and the cap wafer contains an electroplated gold bond ring. Bonding {{has been carried out}} in a standard wafer bonder by performing a pre-bake at 300 °C and then pressing the wafers together by 1 Mpa and subsequent bonding at a temperature of about 400 °C for 30 minutes. Bonding yield of more than 95 % is achieved on 4 ” silicon wafers with excellent reproducibility. Excellent coverage of soft eutectic bonding over non-planar surfaces has been investigated using 1. 2 mm-thick insulated feedthroughs of polysilicon, which shows a good flow of eutectic material over the feedthroughs. Thin film polysilicon diaphragm (~ 2. 5 mm-thick) and micro-Pirani gauge have been used to monitor and measure the low-pressure inside the packaged vacuum cavity. It is more than one year that we are monitoring the pressure by the amount of buckling in the diaphragm, and so far no pressure drop is observed. Direct pressure measurement is also underway by the vacuum packaged <b>floating</b> Pirani <b>gauges</b> fabricated inside the device wafer. It also has been shown that polysilicon is a better source material in gold- silicon eutectic formation as it bonds at relatively lower temperature than single crystal silicon...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{aimed at}} automatic detection and digitalisation of the rainfall signal recorded by <b>float</b> based rain <b>gauges</b> on paper strip charts is presented. The algorithm consists of several steps that gradually {{lead to the}} desired goal. The rainfall signal is extracted from the digital image of the strip chart. By cooperation of moving average method and curve edge following method the rainfall curve is detected and uniquely determined - in each image column there is one single point representing the rainfall curve plotline. From the curve plotline high resolution rainfall time series is obtained. Beside image analysis techniques {{in the design of}} the algorithm, the mechanical features of the recording instrument have been taken into consideration. The availability of high resolution rainfall time series is required in many applications, including rainfall classifcation, analysis of extreme rainfall events, calibration of raifall-runoff models, weather prediction models and many research projects. The algorithm has been tesed on 58 pluviograph strip chart images. The comparison between the data obtained by the proposed algorithm and the official data from the Environmental Agency of the Republic of Slovenia shows that the algorithm usually accurately detects the rainfall curve and consequently an accurate rainfall time series is obtained. Since it is not always 100 % reliable it should be used as a component of a system that would enable the inspection of the detected curve and when required it should also enable interactive changing of the parts needing correction...|$|R
40|$|From this study, we {{find that}} the {{momentum}} premia are universally positive and statistically significant across 16 different momentum trading strategies in the Chinese Class A share market. By defining the time periods following UP and DOWN market states according to prior 12 or 24 -month average Chinese Class A share market returns, we show that the momentum premia of different momentum strategies over time periods following UP market state eclipse those found over time periods following DOWN market state in the Chinese Class A share market for the whole sample period from January 1996 to December 2008. Furthermore, by employing 7 different factors—firm size, firm age, analysts’ coverage, return volatility, dispersion in analysts’ earnings forecast, trading volume, the quality/strength of corporate governance (free <b>float</b> ratio) —to <b>gauge</b> the degree of firm-level information uncertainty, we evidence that the information uncertainty has an amplifying effect over the momentum premium, and the amplifying effect is more pronounced over time periods following DOWN market state. The results from the sub-period analysis revolving the inception of two Chinese financial market regulatory reforms— 1) July 1 st, 1999 the implementation of the new P. R. C. security law; 2) July 3 rd, 2003 the opening of the Chinese Class A share market to qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII) dismiss the doubt that our findings could be sample time periodspecific. Compared with the tradition FF 3 F model, the Wang & Xu (2004) ’s version of the FF 3 F model, with the value effect factor of the traditional FF 3 F model supplanted by residual free float ratio (proxy for the quality/strength of firm-specific corporate governance), exhibits more explanatory power over the momentum premia yet still fails to fully rationalize the momentum premia found in this study. This research fills the gap in the literature and expands the understanding of the momentum premium by offering empirical evidence of the dynamics of the momentum premia amid market swings, the impact of information uncertainty over momentum premia as well as the impact of information uncertainty over momentum premia amid market swings {{in the context of the}} Chinese stock market. The results from this study can potentially provide an important reference point for international and domestic investors in adjusting investment strategies and portfolio positions, or fishing for investment diversification opportunities in a financial market with volatile market condition such as the Chinese stock market.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} float charge {{operation}} of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries in standby power applications. While the telecommunication standby power {{system is the}} targeted application, the results are applicable in any situation where VRLA batteries are subjected to long periods of float charge. The goals of float charge are identified and a test and analysis procedure is developed to provide a means of assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} applied float charge. The primary goal of float charge is to counteract the natural self-discharge of the battery and indefinitely maintain it in a fully charged state. A secondary goal of float charge is to maximise the life of the battery. This is achieved by ensuring that ageing mechanisms such as positive grid corrosion and gas venting are maintained at minimum levels. The problems associated with conventional float charge control are investigated and, in particular, the electrode imbalance problems associated with some long life VRLA cells are detailed. These electrode imbalance problems can result in the cell suffering a gradual discharge of the negative electrode while the cell appears healthy and on a float charge. This ultimately results in reduced cell capacity and is identified as a major cause of the premature failure of long life VRLA cells. Float charge analysis and the subsequent optimisation relies heavily on knowledge of the polarisation distribution between the positive and negative electrodes within a cell. Conventionally, this is determined {{with the aid of a}} reference electrode, although such testing is only possible in a well-controlled laboratory environment. By modelling the steady state and transient features of both the positive and negative electrodes, a test and analysis procedure is developed to estimate the polarisation distribution within a conventional 2 V VRLA cell, in effect creating a virtual reference electrode. The developed procedure exploits differences in the transient response of each electrode to estimate their polarisations at the applied float voltage. The polarisation estimations are typically accurate to within 10 mV, the window of polarisation relating to minimal positive grid corrosion is approximately 40 mV wide, and the total polarisation applied to a VRLA cell is around 130 mV. The test requires only a very low rate constant current discharge, and cell terminal voltage measurements. This test may be automated and applied to cells in field service, and provides the necessary measure to <b>gauge</b> <b>float</b> charge optimisation. The developed test is able to verify that a cell on float charge is indeed fully charged, and assists in determining the optimal float voltage for maximum cell life...|$|R
