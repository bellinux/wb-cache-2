500|$|Romantic friendships {{were also}} {{popular in the}} U.S. Enigmatic poet Emily Dickinson wrote over 300 letters and poems to Susan Gilbert, who later became her sister-in-law, and engaged in another romantic {{correspondence}} with Kate Scott Anthon. Anthon broke off their relationship the same month Dickinson entered self-imposed lifelong seclusion. Nearby in Hartford, Connecticut, African American freeborn women Addie Brown and Rebecca Primus left evidence of their passion in letters: [...] "No kisses is like youres". In Georgia, Alice Baldy wrote to Josie Varner in 1870, [...] "Do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> touch me, or speak to me {{there is not a}} nerve of fibre in my body that does not respond with a thrill of delight?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the request}} of Copley News Service, budget {{watchdog}} Keith Ashdown examined appropriations bills to see how White's clients had fared. Ashdown said he was astonished at her success in getting earmarks. The overall success rate for earmark requests submitted to Congress is 1 in 4, Ashdown said. In baseball terms that's a [...]250 average. [...] "Letitia White is hitting about [...]600 or [...]700," [...] Ashdown said. [...] "She might be the lobbyist batting champion. If I were looking for an earmark, I'd hire her in a heartbeat." [...] "Special interests want to buy influence," [...] he said. [...] "People <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> keep Letitia White happy, you keep Jerry Lewis happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, Peter Porco {{was notified}} that Christopher had also obtained {{a line of}} credit from Citibank to finance the Jeep Wrangler, again using his father's name as a cosignatory. Peter once again wrote to his son, who had not answered his parents' phone calls in weeks: [...] "I want you to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> abuse my credit again, I will be forced to file forgery affidavits in order to disclaim liability and that applies to the Citibank college loan if you attempt to reactivate it or use my credit to obtain any other loan."

2500|$|Inayat Khan and Vera met at Manetta's, a {{restaurant}} in Clarges Street, Mayfair. Above all else, Vera wished to confirm that Inayat Khan believed in her own ability to succeed. Confidence {{was the most important}} thing for any agent. However poor Inayat Khan 's jumping or even her encoding, Vera knew that those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Inayat Khan feel that she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Vera began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Inayat Khan looked startled and said: [...] "Yes, of course." [...] Vera then told her about the letter and its contents. Inayat Khan was upset that anybody should think she was not fit for the job. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have any doubts, it is not too late to turn back," [...] Vera said. [...] "If you don't feel you're the type–if for any reason whatever you don't want to go p you only have to tell me now. I'll arrange everything so that you have no embarrassment. You will be transferred to another branch of the service with no adverse mark on your file. We have every respect for the man or woman who admits frankly to not feeling up to it." [...] She ended by adding: [...] "For us there is only one crime: to go out there and let your comrades down." ...|$|E

5000|$|After The Blue Bird closed, the sisters, {{younger brother}} Joe and cousin Avery, began {{appearing}} regularly in various plays and melodramas for the Poli stock company. Doris Eaton Travis, in her memoirs, noted that [...] "the local stock managers at the Poli theatres <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> needed {{three or four}} or more children, you could call Mama Eaton and get them all in one place."
