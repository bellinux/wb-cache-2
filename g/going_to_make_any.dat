His notable achievements in the bomb squad were negotiating the rise of The Angry Brigade, eventually jailing several members. The other major event he negotiated as commander with the Bomb Squad was the Balcombe Street siege, in which two people were taken hostage by four Irish Republican Army members, who demanded a plane to Ireland. Bond, answering the demands, refused saying that the police [...] "are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> deals". The gunmen surrendered, the event a success for police with no casualties on either side.|$|E

500|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{also had}} a bombing {{campaign}} ongoing, and in December 1975 Bond [...] "saturated" [...] the centre of London with plainclothes police officers. Four IRA members took two people hostage in Balcombe Street, following a police chase which involved a shoot out on 7 December. The terrorists called the police, in a call which was routed to Bond; who refused their demands of a plane to fly to Ireland, proclaiming that [...] "They are not going anywhere {{and they are not}} getting any plane to Ireland. We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> deals at all." [...] The gunmen gave up on 12 December, their surrender sparking fears of reprisals, after what Bond called a [...] "rather humiliating episode," [...] Bond [...] "masterminded" [...] the operation to regain the hostages. He retired the following year, in 1976, and received the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's honours list. Upon his retirement in February 1976, he had served in the police for 30 years, full of [...] "exemplary conduct." [...] In his time, Bond received 12 Commissioner's Commendations and 7 for [...] "courage, diligence and determination in the course of investigations." ...|$|E

500|$|Within the Star Trek canon, {{there have}} been no officially {{recognized}} LGBT characters in the television spin-offs. [...] The International Review of Science Fiction ran a feature entitled [...] "Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9" [...] However, gender identity has occasionally been treated as an [...] "issue" [...] within the new Star Trek series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 [...] episode [...] "Rejoined", which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil [...] "mirror universe" [...] ("The Emperor's New Cloak") or body possession ("Warlord" [...] and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters. In a 2000 Fandom interview, Star Trek screenwriter Ronald D. Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> difference. In recent years, a few of the Star Trek novels and comics, which are officially licensed but not considered canon, have featured serious direct same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character as gay.|$|E
500|$|Journalists and pundits {{reviewing}} the final unanimously {{agreed with the}} outcome of the match. Matt Dickinson wrote in The Times of 6 May 2002: [...] "The force is with Arsenal, but it is not some ethereal presence, rather a brutish will to win derived from both triumphs and disappointments." [...] The Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter was strongly critical of Ranieri's selection-making and suggested Chelsea's failure was partly down to Hasselbaink's lack of fitness, as there was no attacking threat. In contrast he commended Wenger's tactics – [...] "The decision by Arsenal's intelligent manager to deploy Parlour through the middle was a spectacular success," [...] and praised their players' mental strength and resilience. The Guardians David Lacey also lauded Parlour's show in midfield, ranking his goal {{as one of the best}} in Cup final history. Although he agreed with the media consensus that the final was a drab affair and Arsenal's performance was not to their standard, he picked out several high-quality moments that the losing finalists failed to match, one in particular a timed-ball from Vieira. Glenn Moore of The Independent observed how Wenger turned his team of also-rans into winners, noting the manager's decision to play Adams [...] "bore fruit" [...] as the defence dealt with Chelsea's increasing second-half pressure. Football pundit Alan Hansen called Arsenal his team of the season and believed their win was built on the experience of Adams and Seaman; of the former he wrote: [...] "Adams was also able to operate with the confidence that his goalkeeper was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> mistakes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Schwarz and Scandiffio both {{graduated}} from New Canaan High School, in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The pair collaborated on multiple projects through their collegiate careers, {{culminating in a}} short film they produced in 2012, Seconds of In Between, which was chosen as an official selection of the L.A. First Glance Film Festival. Schwarz began work on the screenplay for Those Who Wander in March 2012, marking her first feature-length screenplay. Scandiffio, talking about the film in a local article, said, [...] "She sent me the first rough draft and we immediately had a conversation about, 'How do we make this happen,' We needed {{to figure out how}} big a film we could make. And it didn't matter, we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this film on any budget, even if it had to be just our friends or if we could get it to where it is now, with primarily a professional film crew and cast.

In short, the poor candle-maker's scrupulous morality succumbed to his unscrupulous necessity, as is now and then apt to be the case. He took the check, and was about carefully putting it away for the present, when Orchis, switching about again with his gold-headed cane, said: 'By-the-way, China Aster, it don't mean anything, but suppose you make a little memorandum of this; won't do any harm, you know.' So China Aster gave Orchis his note for one thousand dollars on demand. Orchis took it, and looked at it a moment, 'Pooh, I told you, friend China Aster, I wasn't <b>going</b> ever <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> demand.' Then tearing up the note, and switching away again at the candle-boxes, said, carelessly; 'Put it at four years.' So China Aster gave Orchis his note for one thousand dollars at four years. 'You see I'll never trouble you about this,' said Orchis, slipping it in his pocket-book, 'give yourself no further thought, friend China Aster, than how best to invest your money. And don't forget my hint about spermaceti. Go into that, and I'll buy all my light of you,' with which encouraging words, he, with wonted, rattling kindness, took leave.|$|R
5000|$|Bridget Perrier (born 1977) is {{a former}} sex worker who cofounded Sex Trade 101 with Natasha Falle. She became a child prostitute {{at the age of}} 12 while she was staying at a group home and an older girl there persuaded her to become a runaway in order to sell sex to a pedophile named Charlie. She had a son, Tanner, who {{developed}} cancer as an infant and {{died at the age of}} five with the dying wish that his mother get out of the sex industry. In 2000, she moved to Toronto from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. She is the stepmother of Angel, whose biological mother was Brenda Wolfe, one of Robert Pickton's murder victims. In 2009, Perrier accompanied Angel at Toronto's Native Women's Resource Centre for the Sisters in Spirit vigil in remembrance of Wolfe and the other more than 500 Canadian Aboriginal women who have been murdered or gone missing over the past 30 years. In 2010, Perrier picketed a courthouse in downtown Toronto in recognition of International Day of No Prostitution. She was joined by Trisha Baptie, Natasha Falle, Katarina MacLeod, and Christine Barkhouse, all former human trafficking victims and sex workers. In 2012, after being removed from a news conference relating to Bedford v. Canada, Perrier demonstrated a pimp stick to the media, saying that she had been battered with a pimp stick by her pimp every day that he prostituted her. Perrier opposed the legalization of brothels as proposed in Bedford v. Canada, saying, [...] "Having a legal bawdy house is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it <b>any</b> safer. You are still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attract serial killers, rapists, perverts." [...] Bridget shared her story in the ground breaking article by Dr. Vincent J. Felitti in Cancer InCytes magazine (Volume 2, Issue 1) about how childhood trauma is associated with chronic diseases during adulthood, and how child trafficking will eventually worsen the economic burden on civil governance.|$|R
