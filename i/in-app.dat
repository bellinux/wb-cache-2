5|$|Writing in TouchArcade, Jared Nelson {{wrote that}} the game is unexceptional for players who are not fans of the toy line. While in the United Kingdom the game was subject of {{controversy}} concerning its incorporation of <b>in-app</b> purchases, the Advertising Standards Authority deemed it acceptable. The organization found that the instructions detailing purchases did not coerce players to make such purchases.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{released}} for iPad on August 9, 2012. They {{had decided to}} release the game as an ethically non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and <b>in-app</b> purchases for the extended content. Not as many players paid for the content as expected. This was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked {{near the top of}} an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or <b>in-app</b> purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in December 2014 by developer Spike Chunsoft, and received a promotional video on December 24, 2014. It was released on January 7, 2015 for iOS, and on April 17, 2015 for Android. By May 2015, over 700,000 user accounts for the game had been registered. The game was free to play and had <b>in-app</b> purchases, which allowed the player to buy Monokuma Coins. In September 2015, Spike Chunsoft announced that microtransactions would be stopped on October 13, 2015, and that the game would end service a month later, on November 13.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with <b>in-app</b> purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, they ran out of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 2015, {{a mobile}} game titled Evolve: Hunter Quest {{appeared}} briefly on the iOS App Store {{and was later}} removed. The game was released by 2K on January 29, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS devices. The game is a free-to-play tile-matching video game, {{as well as a}} companion app to Evolve. In Evolve: Hunter Quest, players match three tokens of the same colour in order to unleash attacks on enemies, fill up energy bars to activate special Hunter abilities and earn mastery points to level up. Mastery points earned <b>in-app</b> can then be applied to characters in the main Evolve game on any platform. Players who download the app can also unlock unique game art and watch replays of online matches from a top-down view.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, Apple {{rolled out}} search ads to the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, along with {{additional}} features for developers, including ad duplication settings {{and a new}} campaign role with additional access controls. The next month, Apple announced changes to its app affiliate program, which lets registered members refer people to apps and <b>in-app</b> content for a percentage of sales. The commission rate for <b>in-app</b> purchases was reduced from 7% to 2.5%.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in August 2013, and the development team wanted to carry over elements from the original Dungeon Keeper games by Bullfrog Productions, especially the humour. Richard Ridings provided the voiceovers, {{as he did with}} the previous instalments. The game is noted for its monetization of gameplay by relying on <b>in-app</b> purchases, for which it received widespread criticism. The reliance on <b>in-app</b> purchases also caused outcry in the gaming public. In the UK, Electronic Arts' advertising of the game was ruled to have misled customers, which forced them to amend their adverts. Electronic Arts also faced criticism over filtration of user reviews.|$|E
25|$|<b>In-app</b> {{subscriptions}} {{were originally}} introduced for magazines, newspapers and music apps in February 2011, giving developers 70% of revenue earned and Apple 30%.

25|$|On December 9, 2011, Apple {{announced}} that Logic Pro Studio 9 {{would no longer}} be available on DVD, and would only be sold via the Mac App Store. The price was reduced from $499 to $199.99 for the Logic Pro app, and $29.99 for MainStage. The download was just over 400MB, and 19GB of optional loops were available as <b>in-app</b> downloads.|$|E
25|$|A {{cellphone}} port of Game Boy Advance {{version was}} released in Japan in 2010. The iOS version {{was released in}} 2013. The version is free-to-play, but is different from other versions in removing some save points and relying heavily on an <b>in-app</b> purchase system. On May 29, 2014 the Japanese iOS version was discontinued after which the game cannot be started or played. The English version of the game was discontinued on August 28, 2014.|$|E
25|$|Since 2010, a Britain's Got Talent app {{has been}} {{available}} on Apple's App Store and Google Play. The features of the app vary {{from year to year}} but always include an interactive feature (e.g. a buzzer, polls or quizzes), relevant social media feeds and clips from the show. In 2015, free <b>in-app</b> voting was introduced. This means viewers are able to vote free of charge for five acts of their choice per voting window during the semi-finals and final rounds.|$|E
25|$|Google {{introduced}} <b>in-app</b> subscriptions to Google Play in May 2012. In June 2016, Google {{announced that}} subscriptions charged through Google Play would now split the revenue 85/15, where developers receive 85% of revenue and Google only takes 15%, {{a change from}} the traditional 70/30 split in years prior. The move followed Apple's then-recently announced change of the same model, although commentators were {{quick to point out}} that while Apple only grants the 85/15 revenue share after one year of active subscriptions, Google's subscription change takes effect immediately.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the game}} is free to play, it {{supports}} <b>in-app</b> purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items. These items include incense (which attract Pokémon to you as you move for thirty minutes), lure modules, to attract Pokémon to a fixed location, and lucky eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use. All Pokémon are displayed with a combat power. A Pokémon's combat power is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle. Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP.|$|E
25|$|Pokémon Go is a free-to-play, location-based {{augmented}} reality game developed by Niantic for iOS and Android devices. The game {{was the result}} of a collaboration between Niantic and Nintendo, by way of The Pokémon Company, and was initially released in selected countries in July 2016. The game utilizes the player's mobile device's GPS ability to locate, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, called Pokémon, which appear on the screen as if they were at the same real-world location as the player. The game features a freemium business model and supports <b>in-app</b> purchases for additional in-game items.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November, {{backers of}} the $50 tier or more were given {{exclusive}} beta access, featuring {{the first three}} scenes from episode 1. Both episodes bundled together were made available for pre-order, on 27 November 2013 on Good Old Games, and on 28 November on Steam. Episode one was released on 4 December for PC on the same services (episode 2 would {{be added to the}} game as an update for the same purchase). The first episode was also released for the Vita on 18 December, bought either separately or with the second episode, and for iOS on 6 February and on for Android on 18 March. On iOS and Android, episode 2 would be released as an <b>in-app</b> purchase.|$|E
25|$|On August 25, 2011, a remastered {{version of}} Sonic CD {{developed}} by Christian Whitehead using the Retro Engine {{was released on}} Xbox Live Arcade and the European PlayStation Network on December 14, 2011, followed by the iOS App Store and Android Market on December 15, 2011 and the North American PlayStation Network on December 20, 2011. The PC version was released on January 19, 2012. A Windows Phone version was released in November 2012. Prior to the game's release, Android gaming tablets purchased from GameStop from November 2011 contained the full game. This version allows support for widescreen graphics and spin dash physics from Sonic 2, the ability to unlock Tails as a playable character, both the original soundtrack and the American soundtrack, as well as achievement and trophy support and iOS features. The game was released on the Ouya console on August 1, 2013, and on Apple TV on March 31, 2016. The iOS version was released for free on October 30, 2016. However, the version features <b>in-app</b> advertisements, and users must pay a fixed price to disable them.|$|E
500|$|Lyrics are {{viewable}} for songs <b>in-app</b> in iOS 10. The [...] "Search" [...] tab includes {{recent and}} trending searches. An [...] "Optimized Storage" [...] option removes downloaded music that the user hasn't {{played in a}} while.|$|E
500|$|Most {{levels have}} bonus {{objectives}} such as collecting a briefcase or finishing the level without killing anyone, completing these will reward the player with stars. Stars {{are used to}} unlock the next chapter of levels. The game launched with five different chapters, {{one of which was}} inspired by a level from [...] Post-launch, two additional chapters were added, one based upon a level from [...] The game features <b>in-app</b> purchases which provide hints to the puzzles or unlock level chapters immediately.|$|E
500|$|Mikengreg first {{announced}} {{the game on}} March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with <b>in-app</b> purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that {{a quarter of the}} top grossing games on iOS used <b>in-app</b> purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, [...] "So far, humanity is proving to us that we can't have it both ways." [...] They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. Gasketball had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.|$|E
500|$|As {{the player}} progresses, the game's puzzles become more complex. Successive levels {{introduce}} new game mechanics and enemy types. Enemies {{take the form}} of deadly creatures such as snakes, lizards, and giant spiders. [...] Each enemy type has a specific movement pattern. Single-use items, such as spears, can be collected on levels and then used to dispatch enemies from a distance. Other mechanics include obstacles such as boulders, saw blades, and traps to avoid. The player can activate levers, which shift walls and platforms to open paths through the level. Lara Croft Go also features optional <b>in-app</b> purchases, which provide hints to the puzzles.|$|E
500|$|The game uses {{two main}} in-game {{currencies}} for <b>in-app</b> purchases: {{one that can}} be earned through normal play and completing missions, known as Glory, and {{one that can be}} purchased with money, known as Immensely Concentrated Evil (ICE). Players can also choose to permanently unlock any character for a certain amount of Glory. Skins, which change the appearance of heroes, can be unlocked either using ICE or cards, a secondary currency. Another currency, Essence, can be used to purchase cards, while destroying cards yields a lower amount of Essence. Update 1.18.0 introduced [...] "chests" [...] which provide another way of obtaining any of these currencies; chests become available after completing a certain action (e.g. win 5 games).|$|E
500|$|Alto's Adventure was {{inspired}} by Journey (2012), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater2 (2000), and Windosill (2009). Snowman's co-founders, Ryan Cash and Jordan Rosenberg, wanted to bring {{the essence of the}} Tony Hawk games of their youth into Alto's Adventure, including [...] "fun, positive goals" [...] and an [...] "easy to learn, hard to master" [...] trick system. They avoided goals from other endless runners that they considered negative, uninteresting, or repetitive. As inspired by Monument Valley (2014), the developers chose to charge above average for the game as a trade-off for not including offsets like in-game advertisements or <b>in-app</b> purchases. Snowman has said any new content would be as an expansion along the lines of Monument Valley [...] "Forgotten Shores". The game was released for iOS on February 19, 2015.|$|E
500|$|TNNS, {{pronounced}} [...] "tennis", is a brick-breaking action game {{released in}} November 2012 for iOS. As a universal app, it is playable on iPhones, iPads, and iPods. It {{was developed by}} Action Button Entertainment and produced by Rabbx. Players use a paddle along the screen's left side to bounce a ball towards breakable objects {{on the right side}} of the screen, and to avoid getting the ball in their goal. A star box ends the level. The game's over 500 stages are built as puzzles and played at random. Level features include wormholes that move the ball from one part of the screen to another and arrows that change the ball's trajectory. Power-ups include [...] "multi-ball", which puts multiple balls into play. TNNS also includes objectives, a same-device two-player mode, objectives, <b>in-app</b> purchases, and Facebook and Twitter integration. Action Button later released an Android version.|$|E
500|$|Matt Thrower of Pocket Gamer noted how the PC-based MOBA genre has had issues {{adapting}} its precise {{controls to}} the mobile platform, but that Vainglory trimmed {{features in the}} right areas. IGN's Mitch Dyer wrote that the game was its own [...] "scaled down, rather than scaled back" [...] version of the MOBA genre, and not an attempt to [...] "approximate" [...] League of Legends and Dota 2 experiences for mobile devices. Dyer praised the game's character and map detail, and wrote that all ten of the heroes had [...] "fun" [...] designs and were enjoyable to play. Thrower felt similarly about its graphics as most reviewers did. Dyer praised the iPad controls, but felt [...] "cramped" [...] on the iPhone 6 Plus. TouchArcade Ford described the controls as [...] "flawless" [...] and felt that the game's tutorial was among the best {{he had seen in}} iOS MOBAs. He added that he considered the game's <b>in-app</b> purchases [...] "very fair" [...] and not [...] "pay-to-win".|$|E
500|$|The Mighty Eagle {{is offered}} as a one-time, in-game purchase, and was {{initially}} only available for iOS, as its App Store customers have iTunes accounts with pre-linked credit cards. In late 2011, Rovio also added the Mighty Eagle to the Chrome App version of the game. Rovio has begun testing an Android update called the [...] "Bad Piggy Bank" [...] with the Elisa wireless service in Finland and T-Mobile, which allows users to charge <b>in-app</b> purchases, such as the Mighty Eagle, to their mobile phone bills. The service went live on Android {{with the release of}} version 2.2.0 in August 2012, using Google Play's transaction system, which allows both mobile billing and credit cards, allowing both Android phones and WiFi-only tablets to unlock the features. This version also added the powerups from the Facebook version and added an option to pay to remove ads, allowing Android players to enjoy the game ad-free as iOS players do.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by Josh Aker, who had written the music for previous Chair games. The soundtrack was intended by Aker to be [...] "intense" [...] during combat, but to vary between [...] "serene" [...] and [...] "otherworldly" [...] outside battle. It {{is a mixture of}} live and synthetic instrument performances. Cello and nyckelharpa were the primary instruments used. Aker wanted to have [...] "avant-garde performances" [...] for the recordings. The soundtrack was sold as a digital album, Infinity Blade: Original Soundtrack, through several online music retailers. Chair began to develop the game's first update before the initial game was released. They intended only to add new monsters and features, but added the ability to purchase gold due to customer requests. Chair did not rebalance the game to incentivize <b>in-app</b> purchases. Work on The Deathless Kings update began immediately afterwards. Chair felt that releasing several large, free updates to the game would increase their overall user base and result in more total sales due to word of mouth.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} hinted when Square Enix trademarked Hikari to Yami no Senshi which was initially {{believed to be}} related to [...] It was announced in Japan as Final Fantasy Legends: Hikari to Yami no Senshi on July 21, 2010. The first chapters of the game were first released for iMode phones on September 6, 2010, and for EZweb phones on December 9, 2010. The rest of the chapters were released approximately once a month since then till August 8, 2011 for iMode and November 10, 2011 for EZweb. On Tokyo Game Show of 2011, the game was announced to be released on iOS and Android with improved graphics and sound, and support for slide-pad controls over the feature phone version. On E3 2012, the iOS/Android version was announced internationally as Final Fantasy Dimensions also to be released on August 31, 2012. Due to technical difficulties, only [...] "Prologue" [...] was released first for the iOS version. All other chapters were purchasable at the <b>in-app</b> shop after upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 which was available later in the same day. The Android version was released on December 21, 2012 in its complete form.|$|E
500|$|One {{aspect of}} the game's design that drew {{criticism}} was that limitations of the grid system had led {{to a lack of}} paths available to complete a level. While Gies of Polygon thought that the mechanics of distraction and murder had been interpreted well in the board game setup, he was disappointed that some levels could not be completed without killing non-target guards. Vincent of Destructoid also shared this opinion, disappointed that an element core to the Hitman series had been stripped away. Both Eurogamer and IGN writers thought that the <b>in-app</b> purchases were overpriced but remarked that they could be easily ignored when level solutions are so regularly shared on the Internet. Reviewing the [...] "Definitive Ediion", Phil Savage of PC Gamer stressed that the PC version failed to cover up its mobile roots. He found the click and drag mouse interaction to be less than ideal but still complimented the game's aesthetics and gameplay. GameSpot writer Mat Paget was left dismayed with the VR version of Hitman Go. He felt that the game failed to offer the escapism he expected from a virtual reality game. While he admitted the game itself was excellent, he dissuaded readers from purchasing the VR version remarking that it was not worth the hassle.|$|E
500|$|Blek is {{a puzzle}} {{game in which}} the player draws a [...] "snake-like" [...] black line on the screen that is {{recorded}} and played back like a pattern, recurring repeatedly across the screen. The object is {{to draw a line}} that it will remove colored dot targets when it repeats across the screen without hitting a black dot. Lines that travel off the top or bottom of the screen reset the level, while lines that travel off the left or right of the screen reflect back towards the dots. Aside from repeating the player's drawn pattern, the stroke mimics the player's pace in drawing the stroke. The game begins with no prompt or tutorial other than to use a finger on the screen and experiment. The first puzzles are [...] "on open, white canvasses" [...] where the player can solve the simple puzzles [...] "by accident". The 80 levels progress in difficulty and require more complex solutions. Added elements include a [...] "chain reaction" [...] dot that launches other dots when struck. Its sound consists of a [...] "whoosh" [...] that accompanies the traveling stroke, a [...] "chime" [...] when colored dots are hit, and a human [...] "disappointed grumble" [...] when black dots are hit, resetting the level. The game is depicted in flat, plain colors, with no pause feature and no option menu other than Game Center achievements. Players navigate between puzzles using three small onscreen icons. There are no <b>in-app</b> purchases or in-game advertisements.|$|E
500|$|The player fishes {{in pursuit}} of fame as a {{fisherman}} named Billy. The game mechanics are [...] "three tightly-woven minigames in one": casting the fishing line, catching fish, and shooting {{the fish in the}} air. The player casts the line and tilts the device to avoid the fish as the hook sinks. Upon hooking a fish, the hook ascends and the player tilts the device to catch as many fish as possible en route to the surface. Above water, the fish are launched into the air, and the player taps the screen to shoot the fish out of the sky to earn money before they fall into the water. The fish differ in characteristics including swim pattern and the number of shots required to cash in. The jellyfish shot detract from the total income. There are four stages, each with its own visual and audio theme and rare fish, and an endless mode where players can work towards the highest score. Earnings can be spent in a store towards persistent upgrades such as longer fishing line length, invulnerable drills, frivolous hats, bigger guns, chainsaw lures, a hair dryer and toaster (to zap inadvertent catches), fuel for the chainsaw, and a necktie for greater income. There is also a Fish-o-pedia in Billy's smartphone that gives gameplay hints and tracks stats such as fish caught, which is the progress for unlocking new levels. There are no <b>in-app</b> purchases.|$|E
