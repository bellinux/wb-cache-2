60|$|Hunting her had had {{one good}} effect, it had {{occupied}} {{the boys and}} prevented them from carrying anything off. The stable was safe. What had been burnt was the <b>hay</b> <b>rick,</b> whence the flames had climbed to the house. The roof had fallen in, and the walls and chimney stood up blackened and dismal, {{but there was a}} good deal of stone about the house, the roof was of shingle, and the heavy fall, together with the pouring rain, had done much to choke the fire, so that when Blane began to throw aside the charred bits of beams and of the upper floor, more proved to be unburnt, or at least only singed, than could have been expected.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defendant}} built a <b>hay</b> <b>rick</b> (or haystack) {{near the}} boundary of his land which bordered the plaintiff's land. The defendant's <b>hay</b> <b>rick</b> had been built with a precautionary [...] "chimney" [...] to prevent the hay from spontaneously igniting, but it ignited anyway. He had been warned several times {{over a period of}} five weeks that the manner in which he built the <b>hay</b> <b>rick</b> was dangerous, but he said [...] "he would chance it." [...] Consequently, the hay ignited and spread to the plaintiff's land, burning down two of the plaintiff's cottages.|$|E
5000|$|The reaped grain stalks are {{gathered}} into sheaves (bunches), tied with string {{or with a}} twist of straw. Several sheaves are then leant against each other with the ears off the ground to dry out, forming a stook. After drying, the sheaves {{are gathered}} {{from the field and}} stacked, being placed with the ears inwards, then covered with thatch or a tarpaulin; this is called a stack or rick. In the British Isles a rick of sheaves is traditionally called a corn rick, to distinguish it from a <b>hay</b> <b>rick</b> ("corn" [...] in British English retains its older sense of [...] "grain" [...] generally, not [...] "maize"). Ricks are made in an area inaccessible to livestock, called a rick-yard or stack-yard. The corn-rick is later broken down and the sheaves threshed to separate the grain from the straw.|$|E
50|$|Nan Tuck's Ghost haunts a lane {{one mile}} from Buxted, England, known as Nan Tuck's Lane. Ms. Tuck, from Rotherfield, {{allegedly}} poisoned {{her husband in}} c. 1810. The murder was quickly discovered and {{during the next few}} days, Tuck evaded her pursuers by climbing hedges and hiding in <b>hay</b> <b>ricks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At {{least one}} company, the Norwich Union, issued [...] "fire marks" [...] printed on calico {{for use in}} rural areas. They were to be fixed on <b>hay</b> <b>ricks,</b> corn stacks and {{shearing}} sheds {{on the theory that}} they would indicate to arsonists that the owner was insured and would not be out of pocket should the property be destroyed by fire.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the station}} houses along the line still remain and have been {{converted}} for various purposes. The old station house in Javerlhac is still standing and in good repair. It is now used as the fire brigade station for the part-time fire service. Firefighters are summoned by a siren which is situated on the town hall and controlled by the mayor's office. In summer months the siren can be heard almost daily as hay barns and <b>hay</b> <b>ricks</b> catch fire. The siren is tested every Sunday at midday.|$|R
2500|$|The 19th Hussars {{were posted}} to Ireland in June 1876. In September 1877 French {{was one of}} two lieutenants who persuaded seventy drunk and mutinous troopers, who had armed {{themselves}} with sticks and threatened [...] "murder" [...] if infantry pickets were sent after them, to return to barracks (the ringleaders were subsequently imprisoned—they had been protesting at an unpopular commanding officer, who remained in command for another sixteen months). In the autumn of 1880 the 19th were deployed by rail to Ballinrobe and Lough Mask, to protect labourers <b>ricking</b> <b>hay</b> {{at the height of the}} Captain Boycott disturbances. An Irishman hamstrung French’s horse with a sickle while he was sitting on it.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were two}} prisoners, Petty the ratcatcher, who had {{attempted}} some resistance {{and had been}} knocked down by Griff's horse, and a young lad in a smock-frock who had fallen {{off the wall and}} hurt his knee, and who blubbered piteously, declaring that them chaps had forced him to go with them, or they would duck him in the horse- pond. They were supposed to be given in charge to some one, but were lost sight of, and no wonder! For just then it was discovered that the machine shed was on fire. The rioters had apparently detached one of their number to kindle the flame before assaulting the house. The matter was specially serious, because the stackyard was on a line with the Rectory, at some distance indeed, but on lower ground; and what with barns, <b>hay</b> and wheat <b>ricks,</b> sheds, cowhouses and stables, all thatched, a big wood-pile, and a long old-fashioned greenhouse, there was almost continuous communication. [...] Clouds of smoke and an ominous smell were already perceptible on the wind, generated by the heat, and the loose straw in the centre of the farmyard was beginning to be ignited by the flakes and sparks, carrying the mischief everywhere, and rendering it exceedingly difficult to release the animals and drive them to a place of safety. Water was scarce. There were only two wells, besides the pump in the house, and a shallow pond. The brook was {{a quarter of a mile}} off in the valley, and the nearest engine, a poor feeble thing, at Wattlesea. Moreover, the assailants might discover how small was the force of rescuers, and return to the attack. Thus, while Griff, who had given amateur assistance at all the fires he could reach in London; was striving to organise resistance to this new enemy, my father induced the gentlemen to cause the horses to be put to the various vehicles, and employ them in carrying the women and children to Chantry House. The old Rector was persuaded to go to take care of his daughter-in-law, and she only thought of putting her girls in safety. She listened to reason, and indeed was too much exhausted to move when once she was laid on the sofa. She would not hear of going to bed, though her little daughter Anne was sent off with her nurse, grandpapa persuading her that Rosella and the others were very much tired. When she was gone, he declared his fears that he had sat down on Celestina's head, and showed so much compunction that we were much amused at his relief when Martyn assured him of having searched the carriage with a stable lantern, so that whatever had befallen the lady he was not the guilty person. He really seemed more concerned about this than at the loss of all his own barns and stores. And little Anne was certainly as lovely and engaging a little creature as ever I saw; while, as to her elder sister, in all the trouble and anxiety of the night, I could not help enjoying the sight of her beautiful eager face and form. She was tall and very slight, sylph-like, as it was the fashion to call it, but every limb was instinct with grace and animation. Her face was, perhaps, rather too thin for robust health, though this enhanced the idea of her being all spirit, as also did the transparency of complexion, tinted with an exquisite varying carnation. Her eyes were of a clear, bright, rather light brown, and were sparkling with the lustre of excitement, her delicate lips parted, showing the pretty pearly teeth, as she was telling Emily, in a low voice of enthusiasm, scarcely designed for my ears, how glorious a sight our brother had been, riding there in his glancing silver, bearing down all before him with his good sword, like the Captal de Buch dispersing the Jacquerie.|$|R
