5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|The most {{interesting}} and surprising results occur when i>n.

5|$|After the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural circularly permuted protein, {{researchers}} {{looked for}} a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} historical records of Copenhagen {{are from the}} end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well from the late 12th century.
