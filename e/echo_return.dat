A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and <b>echo</b> <b>return,</b> after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and <b>echo</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E

40|$|Approved for Public release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental study {{was performed to}} devise a technique for measuring the volume backscattering from sediments. This experimental technique has never been performed in the laboratory. The volume backscattering was {{to be determined by}} comparing the <b>echoes</b> <b>returned</b> from the sediment with the <b>echo</b> <b>returned</b> from the water/air interface. Measurements made on <b>echoes</b> <b>returned</b> from the water/air interface indicated that the apparatus, data acquisition system, and analysis system were performing correctly. Two types of sediments (fine sand and aggregate gravel) were used. The fine sand did not produce measureable volume backscattering and the aggregate showed results that depended on the region of sediment ensonified. It is recommended that a sediment more homogeneous than the aggregate, but with more backscattering than the fine sand be used in future studies.

All channels provided stereo pan as well as four cue send buses that could be configured as pre- or post-fader and allowed individual monitoring via a pre-fade listen (PFL) function.

40|$|Acoustic echo cancellers in today's speakerphones {{or video}} {{conferencing}} systems {{rely on the}} assumption of a linear echo path. Low-cost audio equipment or constraints of portable communication systems cause nonlinear distortions, which limit the <b>echo</b> <b>return</b> loss enhancement achievable by linear adaptation schemes. These distortions are a superposition of different effects, which can be modelled either as memoryless nonlinearities or as nonlinear systems with memory. Proper adaptation schemes for both cases of nonlinearities are discussed. An echo canceller for nonlinear systems with memory based on an adaptive second order Volterra filter is presented. Its performance is demonstrated by measurements with small loudspeakers. The results show an improvement in the <b>echo</b> <b>return</b> loss enhancement of 7 dB over a conventional linear adaptive filter.

40|$|Previous work by {{the authors}} has shown that {{striations}} associated with the waveguide invariant can provide a new physics-based tracking constraint that improves tracking performance in pulsed active sonar data. A necessary pre-processing step is to isolate the target return from the direct arrival and other target echoes. Striation-based beamforming {{can be used as}} an optional pre-processing step to preserve the multipath structure in the beamformer output of a horizontal line array. Recent interest in continuously active sonar (CAS) processing has motivated research to determine how striations might be similarly exploited for tracking when the sonar is operated with a high duty cycle. In CAS signals, the direct arrival is almost always overlapping in time with the target <b>echo</b> <b>return</b> and the standard time-gating technique cannot isolate the <b>echo</b> <b>return.</b> In this paper, a time-dependent filter is introduced to isolate and extract the CAS echo spectrum. The conditions in which striation-based beamforming should be applied to preserve the striation structure in the beam output are also explored. The physics-based signal processing algorithms discussed here are expected to provide valuable information about the target’s multipath structure, which can be exploited in an extended Kalman filter for enhanced tracker performance...|$|E
