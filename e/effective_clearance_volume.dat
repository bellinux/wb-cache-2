40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} with rolling piston {{is a widely}} used compressor with less <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> while it is minimized from normal scale to meso or micro scale, the input and exit ports dimension is limited by port requirement and lead to a certain <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> therefore, keeping or improving its volume efficiency is an important issue. Although rolling piston compressor {{is a kind of}} compact structure compressor, the existence of the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is inevitable in a compressor, the more the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> the lower the volumetric efficiency of compressor. The overflow is a method to improve the volumetric efficiency of a compressor which had been discussed in wankel compressor, in the overflowing process the clearance space with high pressure is connected directly with the space with lower pressure, mostly that is in the moment, one of the chambers in the {{rotary compressor}} {{is at the end of}} the exhaust process, and another chamber is at the sucking stage or the initial compression process. The gas pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is visibly higher than that in the compression chamber. The high-pressure gas in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> flows into the compression cylinder via a certain way; this flow considerably increases the pressure in the compression cylinder and decreases the pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> Thus, the intake and exhaust times means to be extended, and the volumetric efficiency and the cooling capacity of the compressor can be substantially enhanced. In this paper, we introduce the effect of input and exit dimensions on the volume efficiency of rolling piston compressor, and the overflow design on a rolling piston compressor that fully uses the high-pressure gas in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> and discuss its effect on the performance of a compressor by theoretical analyses. Usually, the coefficient of performance of a vapor refrigeration cycle with the compressor overflow has a certain decrease compared with the conventional compressor, but the volumetric efficiency of the compressor with overflow and the cooling capacity of the thermodynamic cycle recesses are visibly higher than those of the conventional compressor in terms of the same operation and dimension parameters. The overflow has beneficial effect on miniaturizing the compresso...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the effect of}} compression ratio {{on the performance of}} a direct injection diesel engine. One aspect of engine performance is considered in great detail, namely the combustion performance at increased <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> This aspect was of particular interest because variable compression ratio (VCR) systems normally operate by varying the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> The investigation relied upon results obtained both from experimental and computer simulating models. The experimental tests were carried out using a single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine, under simulated turbocharged conditions at a reduced compression ratio. A number of one-dimensional computer models were developed; these simulate the induction and compression strokes, and the fuel spray trajectories in the presence of air swirl.

40|$|Background: Accelerator mass {{spectrometry}} (AMS) is a sensitive isotope ratio technique used in drug development {{that allows for}} small levels of 14 C-drug to be administered to humans, thereby removing regulatory hurdles associated with radiotracer studies. AMS uses innovative study designs to obtain pharmacokinetic and metabolism data. Objective: This review addresses the metabolism and pharmacokinetics relevant to cases where therapeutic drug concentrations are achieved in humans. Methods: The review focuses on two study designs: i) administration of tracer 14 C-drug intravenously with a simultaneous non-labelled extravascular therapeutic dose to obtain the pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>clearance,</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution and absolute bioavailability without extensive intravenous toxicology safety studies or formulation development; and ii) use of low levels of 14 C-drug during Phase I studies to investigate the quantitative metabolism of the drug in humans early in drug development, {{as required by the}} new FDA guideline issued in February 2008.

For good performance the minimum auxiliary chamber volume, with the cylinder head design used, was 35 per cent of the total clearance volume; for larger volumes the performance improves but slightly. With the auxiliary chamber that contained 35 percent of the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> there were obtained the lowest explosion pressures, medium rates of pressure rise, and slightly less than the maximum power.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of more complete scavenging on the full throttle power and the fuel consumption of a four-stroke-cycle engine. The NACA single-cylinder universal test engine equipped with both a fuel-injection system and a carburetor was used. The engine was scavenged by using a large valve overlap and maintaining a pressure in the inlet manifold of 2 inches of mercury above atmospheric. The maximum valve overlap used was 112 degrees. Tests were conducted for a range of compression ratios from 5. 5 to 8. 5. Except for variable speed tests, all tests were conducted at an engine speed of 1, 500 r. p. m. The results of the tests show that the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> of an engine can be scavenged by using a large valve overlap and about 2 to 5 inches of mercury pressure difference between the inlet and exhaust valve.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oesophageal {{clearance}} of {{acid reflux}} {{consists of an}} initial <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> followed by neutralisation of the acidified mucosa by swallowed saliva (chemical clearance). Ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM), a frequent finding in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), has been claimed to underlie prolonged acid clearance by affecting oesophageal emptying and saliva transport. Intraluminal impedance allows non-radiological monitoring of movement of oesophageal liquids. AIMS: To evaluate the relevance of IOM during oesophageal <b>volume</b> and chemical <b>clearance</b> using combined pH impedance measurements. SUBJECTS: Impedance was validated with fluoroscopy to study <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> in three healthy subjects. Acid clearance tests were performed in 10 healthy subjects in the upright and supine positions, before and after oesophageal peristaltic disruption with sildenafil 50 mg. METHODS: After instillation of an acid bolus, simultaneous manometry, pH, and impedance were used to study oesophageal motility, chemical <b>clearance,</b> and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance,</b> respectively. RESULTS: Impedance allowed assessment of <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> accurately, showing a strong correlation with fluoroscopy (r(2) = 0. 89). Sildenafil provoked a graded impairment in oesophageal motility in healthy subjects without affecting saliva secretion. In the upright position, <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> was slightly prolonged only with severe IOM (> 80 % abnormal peristaltic sequences). In the supine position, severe IOM significantly prolonged chemical and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance.</b> Moderate IOM (30 - 80 % abnormal peristalsis) had no effect. With normal peristalsis and moderate IOM, clearance times were similar in the upright and supine positions. Severe IOM however had {{a greater impact on}} clearance in the supine than in the upright position. CONCLUSION: Ineffective oesophageal motility has little effect on oesophageal clearance during upright acid reflux. With supine reflux, only severe IOM is associated with prolonged oesophageal clearance. status: publishe...|$|R

Expression of PAH in both liver (the usual metabolic source of this enzyme) and skeletal muscle is under investigation.

Both these approaches were effective. When transgenic PKU mice that constitutively expressed PAH in muscle were given intraperitoneal supplementation with BH(4), this produced (transient) <b>effective</b> <b>clearance</b> of Phe to normal levels. In addition, use of an AAV vector containing the genes for PAH, and for two key synthetic enzymes for BH(4), provided substantial and long-lasting correction (more than 1 year) of blood Phe levels when injected into skeletal muscle of PKU mice.
