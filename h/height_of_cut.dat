50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent and {{minimize}} summer patch damage is by using disease-resistant turfgrass species/cultivars. To find these new cultivars one can visit turfgrass seed distributors, extension specialists, or visit the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program website at: http://www.ntep.org. If incorporating disease resistant varieties of turfgrass is not an option, then focus on better management practices. These practices should help promote adequate drainage, reduce soil compaction, and a balanced fertility program. Install an internal drainage system if you have severe drainage problems. An adequate aeration program will relieve compaction and improve drainage. Aeration should annually disrupt between 15-20% of the total surface area. Avoid using quick-release fertilizers; try using slow-release ammonium sources. If the soil pH is above 6, then use ammonium sulfate, which will acidify the soil. Turfgrass {{has been shown to}} be most resistant to summer patch when soil pH is between 5.5 and 6. Most balanced fertility programs for Kentucky Bluegrass lawns will consist of applying two to five lbs of nitrogen/1000 sq.ft. a year. Promote root growth by watering heavy and infrequently. Since low mowing heights are conducive to shallow rooting, raising the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> can possibly result in less summer patch injury.|$|E

5000|$|Budding had {{the idea}} of the {{lawnmower}} after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830. [...] It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be worked by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. The first machine produced was 19 inches in width with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind with motive power coming from the rear land roller which drove gears to transfer the drive to the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. There was another roller placed in between the cutting cylinder and the land roller which was adjustable to alter the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> On cutting, the grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front of the machine which could be used to help pull it along. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. [...] In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud.|$|E

40|$|Bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) is a {{commonly}} used warm-season turfgrass on golf courses, athletic fields, and {{residential and commercial}} lawns across Tennessee. This species grows aggressively during summer and provides high-quality turf when supplied with adequate nutrition, sunlight and irrigation. Winter Damage Warm-season turfgrasses such as bermudagrass can be subject to low-temperature damage during harsh winter weather. This damage, often termed “winterkill, ” can {{be the result of}} several factors, including: • Formation of ice crystals in crown tissue. • Alternating cycles of warm and cold weather disrupting dormancy. • Prolonged exposure to sub-lethal temperatures. What temperatures are sub-lethal? Sub-lethal temperatures harmful to bermudagrass vary by cultivar and management intensity. As a general rule, bermudagrass maintained at lower <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> (i. e., golf course putting greens) are more sensitive to low temperature stress than stands maintained at higher <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> Research has reported that temperatures to injure bermudagrass on golf courses range from 17 to 23 F (Anderson et al. 2002). When temperatures are forecasted to fall below this range, many turfgrass managers will cover sensitive areas (such as putting greens) with a layer of pine straw, a synthetic cover or {{a combination of the two}} (Figure 1, Figure 2). Covers are usually left in place until temperatures warm above this range. Figure 1. A bermudagrass putting green being covered with a synthetic cover to protect from winter damage.

S., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Dr. J. Scott Ebdon As {{water demand}} {{increases}} {{it will become}} more imperative for golf course superintendents, landscape managers, and other industry professionals to improve water use efficiency {{in the management of}} recreational turfgrass. Scheduling irrigation according to actual turfgrass evapotranspiration rates (ETT) is an integral component of efficient irrigation practices. Impracticality of field derived ETT for industry use, however, directs the need of weather station derived reference (predicted) evapotranspiration (ET 0). To accurately predict (estimate) ETT of turf and other crops, scientifically derived landscape (crop) coefficients (Kc values) are used in conjunction with mathematical models that incorporate local meteorological data. Research is limited, however, in identifying Kc values and subsequent ET 0 for turfgrass species selected and maintained under high intensity recreational practices congruent of golf courses and sports fields in the cool-humid northeast climate. Therefore, objectives of this study were to (i) observe and record ETT of three commonly selected recreational turfgrass species; 2 ̆ 7 Exacta 2 ̆ 7 Perennial ryegrass (Lollium perenne L.), 2 ̆ 7 Touchdown 2 ̆ 7 Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), and 2 ̆ 7 Memorial 2 ̆ 7 Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolinifera L.) maintained as golf and sports turf, (ii) analyze the impact various management practices (nitrogen fertility and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut)</b> have on ETT, (iii) develop accurate Kc values appropriate for use with the recommended FAO 56 Penman-Monteith mathematical model for accurate ET 0 of recreational turf maintained in the cool-humid northeast.

40|$|Concern for the {{environment}} and the global crisis on water is transforming the agricultural industry in the 21 st century. Field crops have led the technology revolution and turfgrasses have benefited from this pioneering revolution. The primary difference between the field crop and turfgrass arenas has been in scale of production and focus. Field crops target consistent and reliable yield of usable products while turfgrass performance involves cosmetic performance, playability, and human-impact challenges. Abiotic and biotic stress challenges are similar genetically, but differ in scope for mechanisms of resistance between field and turf crops. Much of the pesticide and fertilizer use is interchangeable between the two cropping systems. Similar control strategies are involved, but sophistication in management is different. Turfgrasses require smaller equipment and are usually driven by <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> Field crops require larger equipment driven by large scale production and harvesting.

Two different harvest schedules (VB, first cut at late vegetative and following cuts at bud stage; VF, first cut at late vegetative and following cuts at early flowering) and two cutting height (4 and 14 cm) were compared to evaluate dry matter (DM) yield, morphological stage of development, crude protein (CP), NDF, ADL, and enzymatic organic matter digestibility (OMD). The stratified quality was analysed in six canopy segments for a summer cut. Increasing the cutting height improved the protein and digestibility contents in both schedules without compromising the stand persistence. In the VB schedule {{the increase in the}} cutting height resulted in an NDF that was lower than 370 g kg- 1 DM, while the OMD were always higher than 700 g kg- 1 OM, both considered as threshold values for quality purposes. The OMD of the bottom parts of stem remained almost constant till 22 cm with values of 470 and 400 g kg- 1 OM for VB and VF, respectively. Leaves showed a constant quality with a CP content of 318 g kg- 1 DM and OMD of 769 g kg- 1 OM.

40|$|The tree legume Tipuana lipu, {{which has}} {{potential}} as a browse species in sub-tropical regions, was subjected to three cutting frequency regimes of 6, 8 and 12 week intervals at a cutting <b>height</b> <b>of</b> 1 m. <b>Cutting</b> at 12 week intervals gave a total leaf yield of 4. 02 t/ha/year which {{was significantly higher than}} the other two treatments. There was 100 % survival of all plants in all treatments over 2 years and the implications of the results for the management of Tipuana tipu in a hedgerow system for fodder production are discussed...|$|R
40|$|For {{practical}} application of micromechanical machining, four levels of process realization are required; fundamental understanding of process physics, development of microplanning (processing parameter optimization), macroplanning (tool path planning), and design optimization. This study surveyed {{the influence of}} localized variation in the microstructure on final process outcome and machinability of brittle optical material in a ductile regime. A clear correlation between burr <b>height,</b> critical depth <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and crystallographic orientation was found on single crystal materials (copper and magnesium fluoride), giving insight into optimal orientations and process parameters for acceptable micromachining process outcome...|$|R
50|$|Saddleback Ledge is a {{rocky outcrop}} located roughly midway between Isle au Haut and Vinalhaven Island {{on the east}} side of Penobscot Bay. The {{lighthouse}} on it marks the entrance to the bay's main eastern passage. The light station consists of a single structure, a conical tower 36 ft in <b>height,</b> built out <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> granite and topped by a ten-sided lantern house surrounded by an iron deck and railing. The interior of the tower has space for the keeper's quarters and supply storage, and has narrow vertical windows on its east and west faces.|$|R
