The fluorescence transients of the samples showed a fast decay (few picoseconds) and a long decay (hundreds of picoseconds) representing a rapid cooling of the excess excitation energy to the matrices and the excited-state lifetime of the dye molecules, respectively. Different dynamic Stokes shifts in PMMA and hybrid glasses have been observed, which is argued to be ascribed to the different couplings between the emissive and nonemissive excited states for {{the two types of}} matrices...|$|E
40|$|Femtosecond {{fluorescence}} upconversion {{experiments have}} been performed on Auramine 0 (a <b>diphenylmethane</b> <b>dye)</b> in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and in hybrid organic/inorganic sol-gel based films. All the investigated samples showed a fast decay (few picoseconds) and a long decay (hundreds of picoseconds). The fast components {{are representative of the}} rapid cooling of the excess excitation energy to the matrices. The long components are representative of the excited-state lifetime of the probed molecules. Auramine 0 in solid matrices showed lifetimes longer than in liquid solutions. Torsional diffusion motions of the two phenyl rings of the molecule are held responsible for the excited-state dynamics. A dynamic Stokes shift has been observed for all samples. The lack of a rise time when detection was on the red side is explained in terms of an adiabatic coupling between emissive and nonemissive excited states, as is the case of liquid solutions. Different spectral shifts in PMMA and hybrid glasses have been measured. A different coupling between the emissive and nonemissive excited states for the two types of matrices is considered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Subpicosecond {{fluorescence}} up-conversion and transient {{absorption spectroscopy}} {{is applied to}} study the excited-state dynamics of auramine, a <b>diphenylmethane</b> <b>dye,</b> in liquid solutions. The fluorescence decays, on a time scale of a few picoseconds to a few tens of picoseconds, {{are found to be}} nonexponential and solvent viscosity dependent. They can be fitted as a sum of two exponentials in ethanol and three exponentials in decanol with a larger average lifetime in the more viscous solvent. The decays exhibit wavelength-dependent time constants, whereas the fluorescence rise time is instrument limited (150 fs) at all wavelengths. The average decay time increases with the wavelength across the steady-state emission spectrum. The spectral reconstruction indicates a few hundred wavenumbers dynamic Stokes shift accompanied by a drop in the intensity in both solvents. From transient absorption experiments, the fluorescent state population is shown to decay to an intermediate dark state and then to the ground state, with a viscosity-dependent rate. A barrierless or quasi-barrierless photoreaction involving the rotational diffusion of the phenyl rings, with a change in the radiative transition rate along the reaction path, is proposed to explain the wavelength-dependent nonexponential fluorescence decays. Both fluorescence and transient absorption data are discussed in support of an adiabatic photoreaction involving internal twisting and charge shift...|$|E
30|$|Di- and triarylcarbonium dyes {{and their}} heterocyclic {{derivatives}} comprise the oldest class of synthetic dyesâ€”the majority {{of which were}} discovered in the 19 th and early 20 th century. <b>Diphenylmethane</b> and Triphenylmethane <b>dyes</b> {{are the most important}} aryl carbonium dyes. Structurally and property wise they are similar to the cyanine dyes i.e. exceptional brightness, high tinctorial strength and low light fastness.|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} dyes have been prepared: a {{comprehensive}} series of novel, unsymmetrical Malachite Green type dyes containing different amino substituents in the 4 -positions of the phenyl rings {{and a series}} of symmetrical Michier's Hydrol Blue type dyes. Both series of dyes have been synthesised from the relevant carbinols or hydrols. The amino substituents used were dimethylamino, diethylamino, pyrrolidino, piperidino, morpholino, thiomorpholino and N-methylpiperazino. The rates of ailcalirie hydrolysis of the dyes at various hydroxide ion concentrations and temperatures have been investigated with a view to elucidating the reaction mechanism and the nature of substituent effects. The rate data obtained for each dye studied have been used to obtain thermodynamic activation parameters and to test the applicability of an isokinetic relationship in the dye systems. The various methods of computation and their results have been compared and discussed in relation to literature data for similar dyes. A stopped-flow technique was used for the kinetic investigation of the fast reactions associated with the unstable dyes studied. The analysis of kinetic data using single substituent parameter regression techniques has enabled substituent constants for piperidine, thiomorpholine and N-methylpiperazine to be interpolated. The steric and electronic effects of the terminal amino substituents on the visible absorption spectra of the dyes have been examined in solvents of varying acidity. The steric and electronic symmetry of the Malachite Green type dyes has been investigated and is discussed. The results from the spectral investigation and the kinetic study indicate that <b>diphenylmethane</b> <b>dyes</b> are considerably less stable than the corresponding triphenylmethane dyes and the reasons for this behaviour are discussed. In addition, piperidino, morpholino, thiomorpholino and N-methylpiperazino are less able to stabilise a dye by electron donation than dimethylamino, diethylamino and pyrrolidino and the reasons for this behaviour are also discussed. The 'H and 13 C nmr spectra of the dyes and carbinols have been recorded. Certain chemical shifts have been used to determine the relative electron donor ability of the terminal amino groups. The results from the 'H and 13 C nmr spectra are discussed in relation to the steric and electronic effects of the heterocycic moieties...|$|R
