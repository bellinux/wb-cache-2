50|$|The Bidoup Núi Bà National Park, {{which is}} located in the northeastern section of the Đà Lạt Plateau, {{contains}} a significant number of mammalian species, totaling some 36 species of small mammals.

50|$|The Old World porcupines, or <b>Hystricidae,</b> {{are large}} {{terrestrial}} rodents, distinguished by the spiny covering {{from which they}} take their name. They range over the south of Europe and the Levant, most of Africa, India, and the maritime Southeast Asia as far east as Flores. Although both the Old World and New World porcupine families belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are quite different and are not closely related.|$|E
50|$|Porcupines are rodentian mammals with a coat {{of sharp}} spines, or quills, that protect against predators. The term covers two {{families}} of animals, the Old World porcupines of family <b>Hystricidae,</b> and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the class Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct {{from each other and}} are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that the}} ancestor to all modern caviomorphs rafted across the Atlantic Ocean (then narrower) from Africa (Lavocat, 1969; Huchon and Douzery, 2000). This is supported by molecular results, which suggest that the Phiomorpha (as restricted to Bathyergidae, Petromuridae, and Thryonomyidae) are sister taxa to the Caviomorpha. In fact, until {{the discovery of the}} Laotian rock rat, all modern hystricognath families were restricted to South America, Africa, or had a range that included Africa (<b>Hystricidae).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{makeup of}} this infraorder is controversial. At its core lie the extant {{families}} Thryonomyidae, Petromuridae, and Bathyergidae and their extinct relatives. The Old World porcupines (<b>Hystricidae)</b> are sometimes {{included in the}} Phiomorpha, but many authorities consider them either basal to all hystricognaths or basal to all hystricognaths except the Laotian rock rat (family Diatomyidae). Molecular {{results suggest that the}} Diatomyidae {{is a part of the}} Phiomorpha, but this is in contrast to morphological results which place the animal at a basal position to all hystricognaths.|$|E
50|$|A {{porcupine}} is any of 29 {{species of}} rodents {{belonging to the}} families Erethizontidae (genera: Coendou, Erethizon, and Chaetomys) or <b>Hystricidae</b> (genera: Atherurus, Hystrix, and Trichys). Porcupines vary in size considerably: Rothschild's porcupine of South America weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 lb); the crested porcupine found in Italy, Sicily, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa can grow to well over 27 kg. The two families of porcupines are quite different, and although both belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are not closely related.|$|E
40|$|The early {{evolutionary}} and paleobiogeographic {{history of}} the diverse rodent clade Hystricognathi, which contains <b>Hystricidae</b> (Old World porcupines), Caviomorpha (the endemic South American rodents), and African Phiomorpha (cane rats, dassie rats, and blesmols) is {{of great interest to}} students of mammalian evolution, but remains poorly understood because of a poor early fossil record. Here we describe the oldest well-dated hystricognathous rodents from an earliest late Eocene (≈ 37 Ma) fossil locality in the Fayum Depression of northern Egypt. These taxa exhibit a combination of primitive and derived features, the former shared with Asian “baluchimyine” rodents, and the latter shared with Oligocene phiomorphs and caviomorphs. Phylogenetic analysis incorporating morphological, temporal, geographic, and molecular information places the new taxa as successive sister groups of crown Hystricognathi, and supports an Asian origin for stem Hystricognathi and an Afro-Arabian origin for crown Hystricognathi, stem <b>Hystricidae,</b> and stem Caviomorpha. Molecular dating of early divergences within Hystricognathi, using a Bayesian “relaxed clock” approach and multiple fossil calibrations, suggests that the split between <b>Hystricidae</b> and the phiomorph-caviomorph clade occurred ≈ 39 Ma, and that phiomorphs and caviomorphs diverged ≈ 36 Ma. These results are remarkably congruent with our phylogenetic results and the fossil record of hystricognathous rodent evolution in Afro-Arabia and South America...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Here we {{describe}} a new short retroposon family of rodents. Like the primate Alu element consist-ing of two similar monomers, it is dimeric, but {{the left and}} right monomers are different and descend from B 1 and ID short retroposons, respectively. Such elements (B 1 -dID) were found in the genomes of Gliridae, Sciu-ridae, Castoridae, Caviidae, and <b>Hystricidae.</b> Nucleotide sequences of this retroposon can be assigned to several structural variants. Phylogenetic analysis of B 1 -dID and related sequences suggests a possible scenario of B 1 -dID evolution in the context of rodent evolution...|$|E
40|$|The low-crowned Hystrix species {{known of}} the Neogene from Europe and Asia and some new finds from Shihuiba near Lufeng, South China, are {{compared}} {{on the basis of}} numerical data. The taxonomical allocation of the seven species recognised thus far is maintained. The occurrences of two coeval Eurasian late Turolian species is discussed. The material from Lufeng is described and allocated to Hystrix primigenia (Wagner, 1848), implicating an area of distribution of this species from S. E. Europe to S. E. Asia in the Turolian. In the northern Chinese <b>Hystricidae</b> the increase of the cheek tooth height is more advanced than in the the West Asiatic and European representatives. The difference in ecological environment of Hystrix gansuensis Wang & Qiu, 2002 (North China) and Hystrix primigenia from Lufeng (South China), both of Baodean age, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{fossil record}} of the genus Hystrix is rather scarce, and {{little is known about}} its origin. Its {{presence}} in Crevillente 2, a well-dated Lower Turolian (MN 11) Spanish locality, is an important fact because, from a stratigraphic point of view, {{it is one of the}} oldest references of this genus. The comparative study of the remains from Crevillente 2 reveals the presence of a small species, Hystrix suevica, which lived in Europe from Middle Aragonian to Early Turolian time. In most recent revisions of the genus Hystrix, this species has not been taken into account. H. suevica shows undeniable morphological affinities with H. primigenia. The latter was a large-sized Hystrix, which spread over Europe from Middle Turolian to Late Pliocene time, reaching Africa at the end of the Turolian. The geographic distribution patterns of the family <b>Hystricidae</b> allow to relate its regression in Europe with the progressive climatic cooling, which started c. 2. 5 Ma ago...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gaudeamus is {{an enigmatic}} hystricognathous rodent that was, until recently, known solely from fragmentary {{material}} from early Oligocene sites in Egypt, Oman, and Libya. Gaudeamus ’ molars {{are similar to}} those of the extant cane rat Thryonomys, and multiple authorities have aligned Gaudeamus with Thryonomys to the exclusion of other living and extinct African hystricognaths; recent phylogenetic analyses have, however, also suggested affinities with South American caviomorphs or Old World porcupines (<b>Hystricidae).</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we describe the oldest known remains of Gaudeamus, including largely complete but crushed crania and complete upper and lower dentitions. Unlike younger Gaudeamus species, the primitive species described here have relatively complex occlusal patterns, and retain a number of plesiomorphic features. Unconstrained parsimony analysis nests Gaudeamus and Hystrix within the South American caviomorph radiation, implying what we consider to be an implausible back-dispersal across the Atlantic Ocean to account for Gaudeamus ’ presence in the late Eocene of Africa. An analysis that was constrained to recover the biogeographically more plausible hypothesis of caviomorph monophyly does not place Gaudeamus as a stem caviomorph, but rather as a sister taxon of hystricids. Conclusions/Significance: We place Gaudeamus species in a new family, Gaudeamuridae, and consider it likely that the group originated, diversified, and then went extinct over a geologically brief period of time during the latest Eocene an...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Pliocene Irrawaddy sediments in the Gwebin area {{of central}} Myanmar {{recently}} yielded a rodent assemblage that contains nine species belonging to four families: four species of Muridae, three of <b>Hystricidae,</b> one of Spalacidae, {{and one of}} Sciuridae. The murids consist of Hapalomys cf. longicaudatus, Maxomys pliosurifer sp. nov., Rattus jaegeri and cf. Rattus sp. indet., which include both extinct and extant forms. Maxomys pliosurifer is relatively similar to Maxomys surifer that lives in South-East Asia in terms of tooth morphology but retains plesiomorphic features shared with the ancestral rat, Karnimata, and possible sister genera of Maxomys, such as Ratchaburimys and Millardia. The three hystricids belong to the genus Hystrix and consist of two extinct brachydont species (Hystrix paukensis and Hystrix sp. indet.) and one hypsodont species similar to living form (Hystrix cf. brachyura). This finding indicates that primitive brachydont species and derived hypsodont species of Hystrix had likely coexisted in the locality, but the brachydont species are significantly more common amongst specimens collected from the Gwebin area. The spalacid species is Cannomys cf. badius and the sciurid species is Menetes sp. indet. These two rodents are similar to living species in continental South-East Asia although they show minor differences in tooth characteristics compared to the living forms. Some species and genera of the fossil rodent assemblage from the Gwebin area also occur in Upper Pliocene localities of Thailand, suggesting chronological correlation between these two faunas. Moreover, these fossil rodent assemblages are composed primarily of the species distributed endemically in continental South-East Asia. Late Pliocene rodents of continental South-East Asia were affected by river barriers that formed during the Mio-Pliocene, and they were probably not able to disperse from South-East Asia into South and East Asia...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Small mammals were live-trapped in {{a primary}} rain forest to {{evaluate}} the relative distribution of species {{to each other and}} to microhabitat properties on the ground and in the canopy. Location: Kinabalu National Park in Borneo, Sabah, Malaysia. Methods: Seven trapping sessions were conducted along two grids with 31 trap points at distances of 20 m on the ground and in the lower canopy at an average height of 13. 5 m. Results: Species diversity and abundance of small mammals proved to be high: 20 species of the families Muridae, Sciuridae, Tupaiidae, <b>Hystricidae,</b> Viverridae and Lorisidae were trapped, with murids being dominant in both habitat layers. The terrestrial community was significantly more diverse with 16 captured species (Shannon-Wiener's diversity index H 0 terr 1 / 4 2. 47), while 11 species were trapped in the canopy (H 0 arb 1 / 4 1. 59). The Whitehead's rat, Maxomys whiteheadi, and the red spiny rat, Maxomys surifer, dominated the terrestrial community whereas the large pencil-tailed tree mouse, Chiropodomys major, was by far the most abundant species in the canopy. Other abundant species of the canopy community, the dark-tailed tree rat, Niviventer cremoriventer, and the lesser treeshrew, Tupaia minor, were also abundant on the ground, and there was no clear boundary between arboreal and terrestrial species occurrences. Main conclusions: As most species were not confined to specific microhabitats or habitat layers, species seemed to rely on resources not necessarily restricted to certain microhabitats or habitat layers, and separation of species probably resulted mainly from a species' concentrated activity in a preferred microhabitat rather than from principal adaptations to certain habitats. Ecological segregation was stronger in the more diverse terrestrial community, though microhabitat selection was generally not sufficient to explain the co-occurrences of species and the variability between local species assemblages. Constraints on small mammal foraging efficiency in the three-dimensional more complex canopy may be responsible for the similarity of microhabitat use of all common arboreal species. Community composition was characterized by mobile species with low persistence rates, resulting in a high degree of variability in local species assemblages with similar turnover rates in both habitats.
