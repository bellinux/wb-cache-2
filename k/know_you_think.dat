On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will."

[...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E

I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
6000|$|He promised, however, that {{he would}} go down to Hampton {{immediately}} after the marriage, and he sent his kindest love to Linda and Katie. 'And, dear Mrs. Woodward,' said he, 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me very harsh, I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me vindictive--but pray, pray believe that I understand all your love, and acknowledge all your goodness. The time will, perhaps, come when we shall be as happy together as we once were.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Captain Rule, I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so and say so--but I {{set down}} all these matters as {{somewhat}} various and onaccountable." ...|$|E

6000|$|GERALD. Good night.--They're very bucked to see {{me sitting}} here with a woman--a young lady as they'll say. I guess your name will be flying round to-morrow. They stop partly {{to have a good}} look at <b>you.</b> Do they <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps Mr. Sisson, your flute {{might call}} out the bird of song. As thrushes call each other into challenge, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that is very probable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess not, pap. I'd like to <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're a-doin' sendin' me 'way back there. Boomtown's {{good enough}} fer me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I am {{a country}} yokel and a fool," [...] John said; [...] "but I wish you'd {{tell me why}} you laughed at me in that mysterious fashion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that I {{have done}} wrong," [...] she then said, {{appealing}} to him; {{and there was}} a tone of sorrow in her voice which went to his heart.|$|E
