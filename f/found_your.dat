500|$|In 2005, Joan Lane of Wilde Thyme, a {{production}} company in London, received the script. Lane started talking with Simon Egan and Gareth Unwin of Bedlam Productions, and they invited Seidler to London {{to rewrite the}} play again, this time for the screen. Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised {{a reading of the}} play in Pleasance Theatre, a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper's mother. She called her son and said, [...] "I've <b>found</b> <b>your</b> next project".|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1930, Tombaugh's search had reached the constellation of Gemini. On 18 February 1930, after searching {{for nearly a year}} and examining nearly 2million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement. Upon confirmation, Tombaugh walked into Slipher's office and declared, [...] "Doctor Slipher, I have <b>found</b> <b>your</b> PlanetX." [...] The object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for PlanetX [...] Lowell had suggested; thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. The new object was later precovered on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915. The decision to name the object Pluto was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell, as his initials made up the word's first two letters. After discovering Pluto, Tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects. He found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids, as well as two comets, but no further planets.|$|E
500|$|Marsden first {{appeared}} on 5 March 2001 in the [...] "Who Shot Phil?" [...] storyline. In the whodunit storyline the five main suspects were Dan Sullivan, Steve Owen, Lisa Shaw, Ian Beale and Mark Fowler. A source in the Daily Record said, [...] "Sooner or later the truth will out. But until then there's {{going to be a}} lot of probing going on." [...] She left on 27 March 2001 after unsuccessfully identifying the shooter (who turned out to be Lisa). In 2002 she appeared in January, April and from 14 November to 6 December. In November, when Marsden returns, the police suspect that Phil has murdered his ex-wife Lisa. The Daily Mirror said, [...] "They are the words Phil Mitchell has heard many times before. 'You're nicked', baldy. Intrepid DCI Marsden may not be a Jane Tennison, but she's nabbed her prime suspect. [...] "I've got some good news for you, Phil," [...] she says, after arresting him on suspicion of murder. [...] "The police in Portugal <b>found</b> <b>your</b> jacket. Unfortunately for you, it's covered in blood. Mrs Fowler's blood..." [...] In 2003, Marsden returned in March July, August, November and for a longer stint in December.|$|E

2500|$|A common way to {{test whether}} an innate jealousy {{response}} exists between sexes {{is to use a}} forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants [...] "Yes or No" [...] and [...] "Response A or Response B" [...] style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, [...] "If you <b>found</b> <b>your</b> partner cheating on you would you be more upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement". As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options. Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. [...] Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Truffaut {{completed}} the editing of The Green Room in March 1978 {{and showed it}} to his trusted friends and co-workers, who immediately praised the film and called it one of his best films. Many wrote to him via letter, such as Isabelle Adjani who revealed that [...] "Of all your films it is the one that most moved me and spoke to me, along with Two English Girls. I felt good crying in your presence." [...] Alain Delon told Truffaut that [...] "The Green Room, along with Clément, Visconti and very few others, is part of my secret garden." [...] Éric Rohmer told him that [...] "I <b>found</b> <b>your</b> film deeply moving. I found you deeply moving in your film." [...] Antoine Vitez told Truffaut [...] "I haven't yet told you the emotion I felt on seeing The Green Room. What I see in it, deep down, is kindness, and that's what touches me most. Thank you for having included me in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to talk about}} blood atonement as a theocratic form of capital punishment whose time was [...] "nigh at hand," [...] church leaders also discussed unofficial blood atonement. According to one interpretation of Brigham Young's sermon on March 16, 1856, the sermon encouraged enforcement of the doctrine by individuals in certain situations. He said that if [...] "you <b>found</b> <b>your</b> brother in bed with your wife, and put a javelin through both of them, you would be justified, and they would atone for their sins, and be received into the kingdom of God." [...] He said, [...] "under such circumstances, I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart, and I would do it with clean hands." [...] But he warned anyone who intended to [...] "execute judgment" [...] {{that he or she}} [...] "has got to have clean hands and a pure heart, ...else they had better let the matter alone." [...] If the adulterous couple were not actually caught in the act, Young recommended to [...] "let them live and suffer in the flesh for their sins." [...] According to Young, when any person violates a covenant with God, [...] "The blood of Christ will never wipe that out, your own blood must atone for it" [...] either in this life or the next [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I <b>found</b> <b>your</b> attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; {{there are many people who}} work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you." ...|$|E
