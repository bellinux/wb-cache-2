50|$|The use of {{temperatures}} {{much lower}} than for conventional cooking is an equally essential feature of sous-vide, resulting in much higher succulence: at these lower temperatures, cell walls in the food do not burst. In the case of meat cooking, tough collagen in connective tissue can be hydrolysed into gelatin, without heating the meat’s proteins high enough that they denature {{to a degree that}} the texture toughens and moisture is wrung out of the meat. In contrast, with the cooking of vegetables, where extreme tenderness or softness is seen as undesirably overcooked, the ability of the sous-vide technique to cook vegetables at a temperature below the boiling point of water allows vegetables to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the de-polymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and/or the <b>gelatinisation</b> of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} a variety of chlorides, sodium salts, {{potassium}} salts and low-molecular sugars on pressure-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> of wheat, tapioca and potato starches has been investigated.

It was found in this work that the glass transition overlapped with the <b>gelatinisation</b> peak temperature for all maize starch formulations studied. Systematic investigation on maize starch <b>gelatinisation</b> over a range of water-glycerol concentrations with MTDSC revealed that the addition of glycerol increased the <b>gelatinisation</b> onset temperature with an extent that depended on the water content in the system. Furthermore, the addition of glycerol promoted starch <b>gelatinisation</b> at low water content (0. 4 g water/g dry starch) and the enthalpy of <b>gelatinisation</b> varied with glycerol concentration (0. 73 - 19. 61 J/g dry starch) depending on the water content and starch type. The validities of published <b>gelatinisation</b> models were explored. These models failed to explain the glass transition phenomena observed {{during the course of}} <b>gelatinisation</b> and failed to describe the <b>gelatinisation</b> behaviour observed over the water-glycerol concentrations range investigated. A hypothesis for the mechanisms involved during <b>gelatinisation</b> was proposed based on the side chain liquid crystalline polymer model for starch structure and the concept that the order-disorder transition in starch requires that the hydrogen bonds (the major structural element in the granule packing) to be broken before the collapse of order (helix-coil transition) can take place.

40|$|A general {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} measure the degree of <b>gelatinisation</b> in samples over a broad concentration range. Measurements based on birefringence, DSC (Differential scanning calorimetry), X-ray and amylose-iodine complex formation were used. If a 10 w/w % wheat starch-water mixture was used, each method resulted in approximately {{the same degree of}} <b>gelatinisation</b> vs. temperature curve. In case the <b>gelatinisation</b> of a 60 w/w % wheat starch-water mixture was followed {{as a function of the}} temperature, each method resulted in a different degree of <b>gelatinisation</b> vs. temperature curve. DSC and X-ray measurements are preferred, because they can be used to determine when the final stage of the <b>gelatinisation</b> process has been completed. Birefringence and amylose-iodine complex formation measurements are suitable alternatives if DSC and X-ray equipment is not available, but will lead to different results. The differences between the methods can be explained by considering the phenomena that take place during the <b>gelatinisation</b> at limiting water conditions. Based on the experimental data obtained with DSC and X-ray measurements, the <b>gelatinisation</b> of 10 w/w % and 60 w/w % wheat starch-water mixtures started at the same temperature (approximately 50 °C). However, complete <b>gelatinisation</b> was reached at different temperatures (approximately 75 °C and 115 °C for, respectively, 10 w/w % and 60 w/w % wheat starch-water mixtures) according to the experimental DSC and X-ray data.

40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry {{was used}} to investigate the effect of mixtures of glucose and fructose, and five types of honeys on starch <b>gelatinisation.</b> At a 1 : 1 starch:water ratio, glucose generally increased the enthalpy (DeltaH(gel)) and temperatures (T-onset, T-peak and T-end) of <b>gelatinisation</b> more than fructose. Upon mixing, DeltaH(gel) of the low-temperature endotherm decreased {{in comparison to the}} sole sugars, but was fairly constant (7. 7 +/- 0. 33 J/g dry starch). DeltaH(gel) of the high-temperature endotherm increased with the fructose content. For both endotherms, the <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures were unchanged (CV {{less than or equal to}} 3 %) for the mixtures. With the honeys (moisture, 14. 9 - 18. 0 %; fructose, 37. 2 - 44. 0 %; glucose, 28. 3 - 31. 9 %) added at 1. 1 - 4. 4 g per g dry starch, the enthalpy and temperatures of <b>gelatinisation</b> did not vary significantly (CV less than or equal to 6 %). Typical thermograms are presented, and the results are interpreted in the light of the various proposed mechanisms for starch <b>gelatinisation</b> in sugar-water systems, total sugar content and possible sugar-sugar interactions. The thermograms were broader in the presence of the sugars and honeys, and a biphasic character was consistently exhibited. The application of an exponential equation to the <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures of the starch-honey mixtures revealed an opposing influence of fructose and glucose during <b>gelatinisation.</b> The mechanism of starch <b>gelatinisation</b> may be better understood if techniques could be perfected to quantify breakage and formation of hydrogen bonds in the starch granules, and suggested techniques are discussed.

Extruded complete pigeon diets would offer the principle advantage of providing equilibrated nutrients and energy, but factors such as starch <b>gelatinisation</b> require investigation before these diets are offered as main dietary items to pigeons. Birds were fed two diets with equal ingredient composition and nutrient content, but with a different degree of starch <b>gelatinisation</b> resulting from altered extrusion processing (high <b>gelatinisation</b> degree (HG) with 73. 6 % <b>gelatinisation</b> vs. low <b>gelatinisation</b> degree (LG) with 53. 1 % <b>gelatinisation).</b> Feed intake and weight gain changes were measured weekly. Blood samples were collected at day 28 and analysed for non-esterified fatty acids, lactate dehydrogenase and glucose. The pH values for fresh excreta were measured; thereafter fresh excreta were collected and cultured for measurement of colony-forming units for bacterial classes. At the end, morphological measurements were examined and the pH values throughout the gastrointestinal tract were recorded. Liver, pancreas and abdominal fat were weighed. There was a tendency (p = 0. 07) towards higher numbers of Escherichia coli in the excreta of the LG group compared {{with those in the}} HG group. No dietary treatment effects were noted on the number of Lactobacillus sp. in the excreta. In proximal parts of the intestine, LG revealed a significantly lower pH than HG.

This trial demonstrated that the lower level of starch <b>gelatinisation</b> degree of extruded feed leads to acidification of the proximal gut and altered gut morphology in pigeons. Hence, extruded pigeon diets should preferably contain low-gelatinised starch instead of high-gelatinised starch.

40|$|To gain an {{understanding}} of the contribution of structural aspects to the <b>gelatinisation</b> behaviour of rice starch, five waxy and 10 normal rice starches, isolated from 15 milled rice samples, were analysed for structural features [absolute (AAM), free (FAM) and lipid-complexed (LAM) amylose contents, amylopectin chain length distribution and relative crystallinity] and <b>gelatinisation</b> behaviour as evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. In doing so, the normal rice starches were classified according to their peak <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures (T-p) as low, intermediate and high T-p rice starches. Higher AAM and FAM contents went hand in hand with decreased onset (T-o), T-p and conclusion (T-c) <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures and increased <b>gelatinisation</b> range (T-c - T-o) of normal intermediate and high T-p starches, whereas LAM contents increased with T-o, T-p and T-c and decreased with T-c - T-o of all investigated starches. For all starches, the relative amounts of amylopectin chains with degree of polymerisation (DP) 6 - 9 were negatively correlated with T-o, T-p and T-c and positively with T-c-T-o.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} pressure-induced starch <b>gelatinisation</b> {{in water and}} milk suspensions. A rheological method, termed ‘pasting curves’, provided an objective and analytical means to determine the degree of pressure-induced starch <b>gelatinisation.</b> In addition, a polarised light microscope was used to observe birefringence of the starch granules {{and the degree of}} starch swelling was measured. The preliminary investigation into pressure-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> of six different starches showed that potato starch was the most pressure resistant and was not gelatinised after a pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 30 min at 20 °C. Waxy rice, waxy corn and tapioca starches showed complete <b>gelatinisation</b> after the same treatment while normal rice and normal corn starches were only partially gelatinised despite the disappearance of birefringence. Based on the preliminary study, two starches (normal and waxy rice starches) were selected for more detailed studies. The effects of treatment conditions (pressure, temperature and duration) on the <b>gelatinisation</b> were investigated with these selected starches. The degree of <b>gelatinisation</b> was dependent on the type of starch and the treatment conditions. The results also indicated that different combinations of the treatment conditions (e. g. high treatment pressure for a short time and low treatment pressure for a longer time) could result in the same degree of <b>gelatinisation.</b> Both starch types exhibited sigmoidal-shaped pressure-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> curves and there was a linear correlation between the degree of swelling and the apparent viscosity of the starch suspension. After treatments at = 500 MPa for 30 min at 20 °C, both starches lost all birefringence although the apparent viscosity and the degree of swelling of normal rice starch did not increase to the same extent as observed in waxy rice starch. Pressure-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> of starch was retarded when starch was suspended in skim milk. This was attributed to the effect of soluble milk minerals and lactose present in the milk whereas milk proteins (casein and whey) did not affect the degree of <b>gelatinisation</b> at the levels present in 10 % total solids skim milk. The presence of soluble milk and/or lactose may lead to less effective plasticising of starch chains by the suspension medium. Interactions between milk components and starch molecules may also play a role in retarding <b>gelatinisation</b> by reducing the mobility of starch chains. The functionality of starch in a dairy application was tested using acid milk gels as a model system. Skim milk with added starch (waxy rice or potato starch) was either pressure treated (500 MPa, 20 °C, 30 min) or heat treated (80 °C, 30 min) and subsequently acidified to form acid milk gels. The addition of waxy rice starch resulted in firmer acid milk gels, and increasing the amount of starch caused an increase in the firmness of both pressure-treated and heat-treated samples. However, pressure-treated samples with added potato starch did not show significant changes in the firmness whereas the heat-treated counterparts showed a marked increase in the firmness as the level of potato starch increased. The difference between the effects of the two different starches {{can be explained by the}} extent of starch <b>gelatinisation</b> in skim milk. Starch granules absorb water during <b>gelatinisation</b> whether induced by pressure or heat which effectively increases milk protein concentration in the aqueous phase to form a denser protein gel network on acidification. The firmness of acid milk gels can be increased by adjusting the pH at pressure or heat treatment to higher than the natural pH of milk. The effect of pH at pressure or heat treatment and addition of starch on the acid milk gel firmness was additive and independent of each other up to a starch addition level of 1 %. This study provided an insight into pressure-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> of starch by showing <b>gelatinisation</b> properties of starches of different botanical origins and the effects of the treatment conditions (treatment pressure, treatment temperature and duration) on the degree of <b>gelatinisation.</b> Furthermore, the results from the pressure treatments of starch in dairy-based suspensions showed that pressure-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> was affected by other components in the system. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the <b>gelatinisation</b> properties of starch in complicated food systems in which a number of other components are present. In terms of the application of starch in dairy systems, when starch was added to milk and gelatinised by pressure treatment, the acid milk gel produced by subsequent acidification was firmer than the acid milk gel made from skim milk alone...|$|E

Due to high substrate concentrations, the residual alpha-amylase activity remained high throughout enzymatic hydrolysis, although high temperatures were used.

In a cross-over trial, fourteen adult pigeons were randomly divided into two groups, in which two extruded pellet diets were tested. Both the diets were similar in ingredient composition and nutrient content, but differed in extrusion conditions, resulting in a different degree of starch gelatinisation: pellets with high <b>gelatinisation</b> degree (HG; 73. 6 % <b>gelatinisation)</b> and low <b>gelatinisation</b> degree (LG; 53. 1 % <b>gelatinisation).</b> After a 14 -day adaptation period, all excreta were gathered per bird during a 5 -day collection period. Coefficients of apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fibre (CF), crude ash (CA) and nitrogen free extract (NFE) as well as apparent nitrogen retention were calculated from proximate analyses of feed and excreta.

This work implies that high pasta quality results from an optimal degree of protein polymerisation during drying and/or the subsequent cooking. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Starches from 3 common wheats and 10 durum wheats were {{isolated}} using a method causing little starch damage and annealing. Durum wheat starches contained 0. 21 - 0. 29 % ash, 0. 44 - 0. 57 % protein, 0. 39 - 0. 54 % lipid, and 26. 2 - 28. 5 % amylose. Wide angle X-ray diffraction measurements revealed A-type diffraction patterns. Durum wheat starches gelatinised over a broad temperature range (12. 5 degrees C) around 55. 5 degrees C (peak temperature), as measured with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (starch/water = 1 / 2; heating rate = 4 degrees C/min). Under the experimental conditions, swelling power was typically 11. 3 g/g and amylose leaching during <b>gelatinisation</b> was ca. 17. 2 %. The granule size distributions showed a large heterogeneity within the starches of the durum wheat family. Clear {{differences were found}} in the <b>gelatinisation</b> behaviour of durum and common wheat starches. Earlier swelling of the common wheat starches during <b>gelatinisation</b> and the larger enthalpy of amylose-lipid endothermic transition (ca. 1. 3 mJ/mg) in the DSC for durum wheat starches can be explained in terms of true lipid contents and levels of amylose-lipid inclusion complexes. Other findings, such as the earlier <b>gelatinisation</b> behaviour of durum wheat starches revealed by DSC, cannot be explained in that way. Differences in starch double helix content between the two wheat families were found. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Starch is {{a mixture}} of two polysaccharides, amylose (AM) and amylopectin, which occurs {{naturally}} in the form of microscopic granules that are abundantly found in tubers, roots, cereal grains and fruits. In order to bring out their functional properties as thickeners and texture enhancers, starch granules are often disrupted by heating in excess water. This process, which is referred to as <b>gelatinisation,</b> causes the granules to swell and exude a fraction of the starch polysaccharides, resulting in a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the starch suspension. Surfactants are known to affect the different aspects of the <b>gelatinisation</b> process and, in particular, the swelling properties of starch. Surfactants are also known to form helical inclusion complexes with AM, the formation of which {{plays an important role in}} many of the instances in which starch and surfactants interact. This work was carried out in order to gain insight into how the surfactant structure (head group and chain length) influences the swelling properties of starch and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. The investigations involved the study of the temperature-induced <b>gelatinisation</b> of starch in the presence of surfactants as well as studies on the association of surfactants to AM in solution and the solubility of the resulting AM-surfactant complexes. Information on the extent of granule swelling upon heating was indirectly obtained by means of viscometry while insight on the molecular events taking place during <b>gelatinisation</b> was sought by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Viscometric studies revealed that, with the exception of the cationic surfactants (alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides), short-chain (C 10, C 12) surfactants induce an early swelling (swelling at lower temperatures than the control sample) in normal wheat starch granules, whereas their longer chain counterparts (C 14, C 16) have the opposite effect. Contrary to this finding, the effect of surfactants on the swelling of waxy wheat starch granules, an AM-free starch variety, is not influenced by the surfactant chain length but by the head group charge of the surfactant. The enhancing/restricting effect of surfactants on the swelling of normal wheat starch is not correlated to their effect on the early aspects of <b>gelatinisation</b> (onset of the <b>gelatinisation</b> transition) but is, in most cases, associated with the dissociation temperature of AM-surfactant complexes formed simultaneously as the granules gelatinise. CLSM studies revealed that, compared to a longer-chain surfactant (C 16), a short-chain (C 12) surfactant has the ability to penetrate further into the granule matrix during <b>gelatinisation,</b> which may favour its availability for interacting with different starch granule components during <b>gelatinisation.</b> Studies on the interactions between AM and surfactants with different chain length (C 12 vs. C 16) and head group (sodium sulphates vs. maltosides) revealed that the presence of a charged head group favours the water solubility of the resulting AM-surfactant complexes. However, this effect can be counteracted by the effect of the surfactant chain length: an increase in the chain length (C 12 vs. C 16) decreases the solubility of the complex. QC 2010091...|$|E
40|$|Starch is a plant {{polysaccharide}} with interesting {{functional properties}} (e. g. good gelling, thickening and stabilising capacity) {{which makes it}} a widely used ingredient in products like sauces, soups, bakery and dairy products and candy. To meet the high industrial process and product requirements, starches are often chemically modified. However, with the increasing demand for more natural food products, it is important to investigate alternative, natural ways to alter starch properties. One way to generate new properties is by blending different starches. Starches in a blend can influence each other’s <b>gelatinisation</b> swelling, pasting and gelation and exhibit unexpected physical properties. When the blend properties can(not) be predicted from those of the individual starches, we use the terminology ‘(non) -additive effects’. This dissertation studied <b>gelatinisation,</b> swelling, pasting and gelation of blends of potato (PS), waxy rice (WRS), rice (RS), waxy maize (WMS) and maize (MS) starches and the interactions between the starches. Furthermore, the impact of starch concentration, amylose content, swelling power, granule size and ion content on the properties of starch blends was evaluated. The selected starches showed large differences in crystal type (B-type for PS, A-type for the cereal starches), amylose content (20 - 30 % for PS, RS and MS, 0 % for WRS and WMS) and granule size [10 - 100 µm for PS, 5 - 20 µm for (W) MS and 3 - 8 µm for (W) RS]. Furthermore, the swelling power of PS was respectively 2. 5, 4. 1, 5. 6 and 6. 2 times higher than that of WMS, WRS, MS and RS. <b>Gelatinisation</b> temperatures increased in the order PS, WRS, MS, WMS and RS. PS had a much higher peak viscosity during heating than the cereal starches, but it showed also more viscosity breakdown. RS and MS reached a lower peak viscosity, but showed more setback than WRS and WMS. In a first part, <b>gelatinisation</b> of blends of PS and WRS, RS, WMS or MS (1 : 1 starch dry matter: water) was studied with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD). <b>Gelatinisation</b> is the irreversible loss of molecular order when a starch suspension is heated at or above the <b>gelatinisation</b> temperature. WAXD was used to differentiate between the starches in the blend based on their crystal types. Bimodal <b>gelatinisation</b> endotherms were observed both for the individual starches and for the blends. Due to competition for water, <b>gelatinisation</b> of the blends differed from what was expected based on the individual components. <b>Gelatinisation</b> of PS was finished at lower temperature in the blend, while <b>gelatinisation</b> of the other starch was postponed to higher temperature. A novel method to calculate <b>gelatinisation</b> of each starch in the blend based on DSC data qualitatively agreed with the WAXD data. In a second part, pasting and gelation of starch blends was investigated with Rapid Visco Analysis (RVA). This involves granule swelling, leaching of carbohydrates and formation of a three-dimensional network of leached molecules. Pasting profiles of blends of PS and WRS, RS, WMS or MS showed non-additive effects which depended on the total starch concentration. Peak viscosities of the blends were lower than expected at lower total starch concentrations (6. 0 %), peak viscosities changed linearly with the percentages of one starch in the blend. Minimum and end viscosity readings were between the values of the individual starches at lower total starch concentrations. However, at higher total starch concentrations, they were at least as high as the values for PS, especially for blends with MS and RS. The presence of amylose in these starches added to the non-additive effects as these blends reached higher end viscosities than blends with WRS or WMS. To further investigate the factors impacting pasting and gelation of starch blends, different approaches were used. The role of swelling power was studied by reducing that of one starch in the blend by cross-linking it to the extent that viscosity development could no longer be measured with RVA. The cross-linked starch contributed to viscosity development in the blend by increasing the total solid content. The role of granule size was investigated by fractionating PS in three fractions with different granule sizes. The smallest granules had a higher swelling power than the larger granules. Blends of these fractions with WRS showed different pasting profiles. Blends with the smallest PS granules had higher viscosity readings throughout the temperature-time profile than blends with the larger PS granules. However, these differences were probably determined more by the difference in swelling power and granule rigidity between the fractions than by the initial difference in granule size. In a last part, the role of cations was studied. For this, cations were removed from the cereal starches with MilliQ water or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solutions. The negative charges of phosphate monoesters present in PS can be shielded or even bridged by cations, which reduces hydration and swelling of the PS granules. Removal of cations from the cereal starches led to much higher peak viscosities for the blends with PS. Thus, the reduced swelling observed for blends of PS with native cereal starches was due to the presence of cations in the cereal starches. In conclusion, this work contributed to our understanding of interactions between starches during <b>gelatinisation,</b> swelling, pasting and gelation. We here presented a method to distinguish between starches with different crystal types in blends during <b>gelatinisation.</b> With this, we revealed that <b>gelatinisation</b> in the blends occurs differently from <b>gelatinisation</b> of the individual components. In addition, the study of different aspects impacting pasting and gelation showed that especially the very large swelling power and the presence of phosphate monoesters in PS add to non-additive effects in an important way. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Potato starch {{has been}} acetylated in a counter {{rotating}} twin screw extruder using vinylacetate and sodium hydroxide. The desired starch acetylation reaction {{is accompanied by}} an undesired parallel base catalysed hydrolysis reaction of vinylacetate and a consecutive hydrolysis reaction of the acetylated starch. Also deacetylation may occur. During the extrusion process sodium hydroxide, vinylacetate, granular potato starch and water were supplied to the extruder. Conversions up to 100 % could be achieved. The degree of substitution could be varied from 0. 05 to 0. 2. Selectivities from vinylacetate towards starch of up to 80 % could be achieved. From reaction kinetics and experiments it could be concluded that the deacetylation reaction could be neglected. The degree of <b>gelatinisation</b> {{appeared to be a}} major key parameter. Increasing the <b>gelatinisation</b> in an early stage of the extrusion process, at high starch concentrations and temperatures, increases the selectivity and degree of substitution. The <b>gelatinisation</b> degree can be increased by applying high shear and temperatures to the starch granule and by using screws with modified geometries. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{granules}} of amaranth starch {{are very}} small compared with starches from other sources. In the current work, amaranth starches with different amylose contents were treated with hydrochloric acid {{as a function of}} time in order to study the effect of acid treatments on starches. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic oscillation in shear were employed to analyse the thermal and rheological properties of acid-modified amaranth starch. RESULTS: Results showed that <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures and enthalpy change of <b>gelatinisation</b> (Delta H) decreased steeply initially, and had a slight increase with further treatment up to 12 h then decreased, an outcome that reflected distinct resistance to acid with various amylose contents. Rheological parameters of storage and loss moduli during heating, cooling and frequency sweep of modified starches reflected the differential scanning calorimetry results by decreasing in value as the time of acid hydrolysis increased. CONCLUSION: With amylose content increase, the effects of acid hydrolysis on <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures became less pronounced. Nevertheless, prolonged acid hydrolysis decreased the storage and loss moduli, with the starch pastes becoming more liquid-like...|$|E
40|$|Three {{models are}} {{presented}} for the wetting of whole grains of cereal. Two are for temperatures below <b>gelatinisation</b> temperatures, {{one of which}} incorporates the effects of swelling of the grain. A third model is presented for wetting of a grain at temperatures above <b>gelatinisation,</b> and hence cooking the grain. The models are developed as partial differential equations, and solved {{in a variety of}} ways. A model that ignores swelling at temperatures below <b>gelatinisation</b> is solved for wetting times by using the concept of mean action time, which reduces the problem to an exactly solvable linear Poisson equation. The other two models, which include swelling and cooking respectively, are solved approximately, taking advantage of the steep nonlinear diffusion fronts that develop. The aim of the modelling is to improve understanding of the cooking of whole grain cereals prior to processing into breakfast cereals. Moisture penetration curves are obtained and compared. Regions where penetration rate is approximately linear are noted, suggesting that nonlinear diffusion equations are a promising way to model grain wetting and cooking.
