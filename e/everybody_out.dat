500|$|McCain accused President Obama {{of being}} [...] "directly responsible" [...] for the 2016 Orlando nightclub {{shooting}} [...] "because {{when he pulled}} <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS {{is what it is}} today thanks to Barack Obama’s failures." ...|$|E
500|$|Chater {{has noted}} that [...] "Sunshine" [...] was {{included}} in the album at the last minute but is one of his favorite tracks on Wildflower. [...] "It starts off appearing like it's a very happy, joyous song," [...] says Chater, [...] "but there's a twist in the tale when the sample reveals that it's actually about someone having their sunshine taken away – the blue skies turn grey. It's really a song for <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> there who's every lost love, who's ever been broken-hearted." [...] The lyrics to [...] "If I Was a Folkstar" [...] were written by Toro y Moi about him and his wife taking LSD on the beach shortly after they got married. The title of the album, Wildflower, was chosen for its simplicity. The group was inspired by other albums with simple titles which do not distract from the music, such as Smile by the Beach Boys. The cover art is a direct reference to Sly and the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) [...] in order to draw from the record's rebellious counter-culture nature, however approaching a more psychedelic style.|$|E
2500|$|Elvis's {{second set}} in the show {{consisted}} of [...] "Ready Teddy" [...] and a short on-air comment to Sullivan, [...] "Ah, Mr. Sullivan. We know that somewhere out there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> here, {{are looking forward to}} seeing you back on television." [...] Next, Elvis declared, [...] "Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog ...,' [...] " [...] as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.|$|E

2500|$|On December 17, Prime Minister Harper {{suggested}} that the attacker {{may not have been}} acting alone, but did not elaborate. In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. [...] "All you hear is a whole lot of shooting coming towards you, and you don't know if that's a firefight or whether it's just a bunch of guys with automatic weapons wiping <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> in their path." [...] After the incident, Harper's first call was to his mother to reassure her.|$|E
2500|$|When I was young, {{literary}} critics often rejoiced that {{the hypocrisy of}} the Victorians had been discredited, or expressed confidence that the operation would soon be complete. So far from that, it has returned in a peculiarly stifling form to take possession of critics of Eng. Lit.; Mr Pecksniff has become {{the patron saint of}} many of my colleagues. As so often, the deformity is the result of severe pressure between forces in themselves good. The study of English authors of the past is now centred in the universities, and yet there must be no censorship - no work of admitted literary merit may be hidden from the learners. Somehow we must save poor Teacher's face, and protect him from the indignant or jeering students, local authorities or parents. It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as much as we do, even, and wanted his book to shame <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> of being so nasty ever again. This is often called fearless or unflinching criticism, and one of its ill effects is to make the young people regard all literature as a terrific nag or scold. Independently of this, a strong drive has been going on to recover the children for orthodox or traditional religious beliefs; ... and when you understand all that, you may just be able to understand how they manage to present James Joyce as a man devoted to the God who was satisfied by the crucifixion. The concordat was reached over his dead body.|$|E
2500|$|In a New York City park, hippies have {{gathered}} with guitars to sing protest songs. Fritz {{and his buddies}} show up {{in an attempt to}} meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that the girls are more interested in the crow standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about blacks, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark, indicates that he is gay and walks away. Fritz invites the girls to [...] "seek the truth", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have group sex in the bathtub. Meanwhile, the police (portrayed as pigs) arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the party-goers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in marijuana. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a synagogue. Fritz manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into Israel.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Pros,' he said, 'music-hall artistes, you know, {{waiting to}} see old Abe Riesbitter. This is September the first, vaudeville's opening day. The early fall,' said Gussie, who {{is a bit of}} a poet in his way, 'is vaudeville's springtime. All over the country, as August wanes, {{sparkling}} comediennes burst into bloom, the sap stirs in the veins of tramp cyclists, and last year's contortionists, waking from their summer sleep, tie themselves tentatively into knots. What I mean is, this is the beginning of the new season, and <b>everybody's</b> <b>out</b> hunting for bookings.' ...|$|R
60|$|In fact, in {{the early}} summer <b>everybody</b> went <b>out</b> of town. The few who ever {{revisited}} the place in August reported that they hadn't seen a soul on the street.|$|R

60|$|The King, {{arriving}} {{like the}} whirlwind, turned <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> {{of the closet}} in which the duke--but newly risen--received him in bed-gown and night-cap. Alone with his minister, Henry came abruptly to the matter.|$|E
60|$|At last he {{flew into}} a rage--much {{increased}} by {{the frequency of}} his potations--and with many imprecations, concluded by driving <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> of the cabin. We tumbled up the gangway in high good-humour.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>everybody</b> went <b>out</b> to the ring, and Ospakar and Eric {{stripped}} for wrestling. They were clad {{in tight}} woollen jerkins and hose, and sheep-skin shoes {{were on their}} feet.|$|R

60|$|Sennit availed {{himself of}} this accident, to make further remonstrances {{on the subject}} of having any more men put in the boat. It was easy to see, it was as much his policy to get <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> of that little conveyance, as it was mine to get all the English into her.|$|E
60|$|Three {{days after}} this, Harry {{received}} {{a note from}} Mr. Martin. When he read it, he gave a shout that brought <b>everybody</b> <b>out</b> of the house--Kate first.

60|$|LADY MARKBY. Her name is Mrs. Cheveley! One of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose. But I really don’t know. Families are so mixed nowadays. Indeed, as a rule, <b>everybody</b> turns <b>out</b> to be {{somebody}} else.|$|R

6000|$|But I'm too late, and {{therefore}} must make play.
