5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> their mothers {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E
5|$|Maria's {{paternal}} grandfather, , {{had been}} a respected teacher in Lublin, where he taught the young Bolesław Prus, who would become a leading figure in Polish literature. Her father, Władysław Skłodowski, taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw gymnasia for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use.|$|E
5|$|The Fergusons were Episcopalian, and in 1766, {{the second}} laird, Lord Pitfour {{had a small}} Qualified Chapel built on the estate at Waulkmill. It was a large, plain {{building}} that could accommodate up to 500 people. Saplinbrae, a house that was initially used as a coaching inn after it was built under <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Lord Pitfour in 1756, {{was used as the}} minister's manse for the first chapel.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, predication is {{an architectural}} feature that provides {{an alternative to}} conditional branch instructions. Predication works by executing <b>instructions</b> <b>from</b> both paths of the branch and only permitting those <b>instructions</b> <b>from</b> the taken path to modify architectural state. The <b>instructions</b> <b>from</b> the taken path are permitted to modify architectural state {{because they have been}} associated (predicated) with a predicate, a Boolean value used by the instruction to control whether the instruction is allowed to modify the architectural state or not.|$|R
5|$|The team {{travelled}} to Europe in pre-season, playing friendlies against Eintracht Braunschweig and Standard Liège. After {{returning to}} England they played Portsmouth at Fratton Park, winning 2–0, and finished their preparations with a resounding home win against Borussia Dortmund. Between matches, the players followed a fitness plan created by former athlete Joe Lancaster, under <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Malcolm Allison. The training regime was initially unpopular with the players; {{the severity of}} the first session caused some players to vomit.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training {{both in and out}} of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in {{contravention}} of a standing IDF order, to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had been called to extract the others.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Candolle's {{initiation}} to botany {{happened in}} 1794 thanks to Pierre Etienne Vaucher in Geneva. He spent then {{four years at}} the Geneva Academy, studying science and law according to his father's wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after Geneva had been annexed to the French Republic. His botanical career began {{with the help of}} René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was born}} in Gresik, East Java, Dutch East Indies, on 2 March 1904. His father, Usman Iskandar, was a wood merchant, and his mother, a housewife, was the {{daughter}} of an ulama (scholar of Islam). The couple, who were of modest means, had four other children, and the family's lack of a noble background meant the children were ineligible to receive an education at Dutch-run schools. Instead, Fakih studied Islam from a young age, receiving much of his <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> his father. At the age of ten he began studying at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Gresik, finishing four years later. In 1919 he continued his studies at several pesantren outside the city, including ones in rural Gresik and in nearby Bungah.|$|E

5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> their manager José Pastoriza, {{began to}} sit back in their own half {{inviting}} Liverpool to attack them. Their plan worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball. The second half saw Liverpool continue to attack the Independiente goal, but to no avail. Midfielders John Wark and Mølby {{tried to find a}} way through the Independiente defence was equal to their efforts. Wark's efforts trying to engineer an equalising goal resulted in him being substituted for Ronnie Whelan in the 76th minute, due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|He won a {{government}} {{scholarship to the}} University of Melbourne and Queen's College, a university residential college. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff {{decided that he would}} have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. He decided to take up medical studies {{at the end of his}} third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.|$|E
5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball down {{across the face of}} goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot and poked the ball into the roof of the Bayern goal for United to take the lead. The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E

He commenced his studies in jurisprudence {{at the age of}} 17 in New Manchester, which was then the county seat of Hancock, and {{received his}} law books and <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> the town's lawyers. Melvin then relocated to New Lisbon, Ohio, for a year to further his law studies under the instruction of a friend. In 1853, at the age of 18, he passed his bar examination and was admitted to the bar of Hancock County. Melvin then practiced law in association with O.W. Langfitt in New Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April 1941, Sheean {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Naval Reserve. He had {{followed}} in the steps of five of his brothers who had already joined the armed forces—four in the Australian Army {{and one in the}} Royal Australian Navy—for service in the Second World War. Sheean was initially posted to the Hobart naval base HMAS Derwent for training, where he gained a period of seafaring experience aboard HMAS Coombar, an auxiliary minesweeper, from 17–31 December. On finishing his initial training course, Sheean was attached to the Flinders Naval Depot in Western Port, Victoria, for further <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> 11 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.|$|E

5|$|Ueshiba studied several {{martial arts}} during his early life, and was renowned for his {{physical}} strength during his youth. During his sojourn in Tokyo he studied Kitō-ryū jujutsu under Takisaburo Tobari, and briefly {{enrolled in a}} school teaching Shinkage-ryū. His training in Gotō-ha Yagyū-ryu under Masakatsu Nakai was sporadic due to his military service, although he was granted a diploma in the art within a few years. In 1901 he received some <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> Tozawa Tokusaburōin in Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū jujutsu and he studied judo with Kiyoichi Takagi in Tanabe in 1911, after his father had a dojo built on the family compound to encourage his son's training. In 1907, after his return from the war, he was also presented with a certificate of enlightenment (shingon inkyo) by his childhood teacher Mitsujo Fujimoto.|$|E
5|$|Geyer's love of {{the theatre}} came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances. In his {{autobiography}} Mein Leben Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel. In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel's school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received some piano <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> his Latin teacher. He struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear. Following Geyer's death in 1821, Richard {{was sent to the}} Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother. At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the Gothic elements of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Der Freischütz, which he saw Weber conduct. At this period Wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright. His first creative effort, listed in the Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis (the standard listing of Wagner's works) as WWV 1, was a tragedy called Leubald. Begun when he was in school in 1826, the play was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe. Wagner was determined to set it to music, and persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written <b>instruction</b> <b>from</b> his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
