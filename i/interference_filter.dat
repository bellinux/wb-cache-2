50|$|An <b>interference</b> <b>filter</b> {{consists}} of multiple thin layers of dielectric material having different refractive indices. There {{also may be}} metallic layers. In its broadest meaning, interference filters comprise also etalons that could be implemented as tunable interference filters.

An <b>interference</b> <b>filter</b> guarantees the specified wavelength. Due to focusing light to a spot at the prism surface, a wide range of different angles is covered.As shown in the figure [...] "Schematic setup of an automatic refractometer" [...] the measured sample is in direct contact with the measuring prism. Depending on its refractive index, the incoming light below the critical angle of total reflection is partly transmitted into the sample, whereas for higher angles of incidence the light is totally reflected. This dependence of the reflected light intensity from the incident angle is measured with a high-resolution sensor array. From the video signal taken with the CCD sensor the refractive index of the sample can be calculated.This method of detecting the angle of total reflection is independent on the sample properties. It is even possible to measure the refractive index of optically dense strongly absorbing samples or samples containing air bubbles or solid particles [...] Furthermore, only a few microliters are required and the sample can be recovered. This determination of the refraction angle is independent of vibrations and other environmental disturbances.|$|E
