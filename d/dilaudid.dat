25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (<b>Dilaudid,</b> Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E

50|$|Thebacon is an opioid agonist {{narcotic}} analgesic of {{the middle}} range and a strong antitussive, primarily used in Europe, although {{it is no longer}} in common use.

The other dihydromorphinone used as an antitussive is hydromorphone (<b>Dilaudid</b> cough syrup); the other narcotic antitussives are either more directly related to codeine or not related at all (open chain methadone relatives and thiambutenes).|$|E

An extended-release version of hydromorphone called Palladone was available for a short time in the United States before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a July 2005 FDA advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. As of March 2010, it is still available in the United Kingdom under the brand name Palladone SR, Nepal under the brand name Opidol, and in most other European countries.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dilaudid</b> (hydromorphone), a {{powerful}} and very water-soluble narcotic analgesic (Betäubungsmittel) introduced in 1926, as small oral tablets {{of a number of}} strengths, multi-purpose (hypodermic) tablets, compounding powder, ampoules of solution for injection, and dry ampoules for reconstitution. Knoll also produced somewhat similar hydrocodone tablets named Dicodid; this drug which compares to codeine as hydromorphone compares to morphine was first synthesised and announced in Germany in 1920. [...] The obverse sides of the oral tablets bear a stylised letter [...] "K" [...] and the reverse has the relevant imprint code for the medication in the locale of sale and/or number of milligrammes of hydromorphone.|$|E
5000|$|Analgesics (also {{known as}} [...] "painkillers") {{are used to}} relieve pain (achieve [...] ). The word {{analgesic}} derives from Greek [...] "αν-" [...] (an-, [...] "without") and [...] "άλγος" [...] (álgos, [...] "pain"). Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems; they include paracetamol (para-acetylaminophenol, also known in the US as acetaminophen), the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as the salicylates, and opioid drugs such as hydrocodone, codeine, heroin and oxycodone. Some further examples of the brand name prescription opiates and opioid analgesics {{that may be used}} recreationally include Vicodin, Lortab, Norco (hydrocodone), Avinza, Kapanol (morphine), Opana, Paramorphan (oxymorphone), <b>Dilaudid,</b> Palladone (hydromorphone), and OxyContin (oxycodone).|$|E
5000|$|Tennant {{sponsored}} a bill, which became law in 1997, to make highly restricted narcotics more available {{to patients with}} severe and intractable pain. The law, which includes a [...] "Pain Patient's Bill of Rights", requires doctors to advise {{patients who suffer from}} severe, chronic, and intractable pain that narcotics such as Percodan, Demerol and <b>Dilaudid</b> could be prescribed. According to Tennant and bill author Leroy Greene, doctors were failing to prescribe these drugs in the large quantities needed for severe pain relief because they feared prosecution for overprescribing a controlled substance, or because they are philosophically opposed to narcotics because they can create dependency.|$|E
50|$|Hydromorphone, {{also known}} as dihydromorphinone, and sold under the brand name <b>Dilaudid</b> among others, is a {{centrally}} acting pain medication of the opioid class. It is made from morphine. Comparatively, hydromorphone is to morphine as hydrocodone is to codeine - it is a hydrogenated ketone thereof. In medical terms, it is an opioid analgesic and, in legal terms, a narcotic. Hydromorphone is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly intravenously (IV) because its bioavailability is very low orally, rectally, and intranasally. Sublingual administration (under the tongue) is usually superior to swallowing for bioavailability and effects; however, hydromorphone is bitter and hydrophilic like most opiates, not lipophilic, so it is absorbed poorly and slowly through mouth membranes.|$|E
