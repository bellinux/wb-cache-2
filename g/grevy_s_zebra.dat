40|$|The Allideghi Wildlife Reserve in the Amibara District of Afar Regional State, Ethiopia, has {{international}} {{significance for}} harboring endangered Grevy 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Zebra</b> {{and other wildlife}} dependent on grasslands. The reserve is increasingly used by pastoral people and their herds. Impacts of livestock on native vegetation include direct effects of grazing and indirect effects from livestock-facilitated dispersal of an invasive plant, Prosopis juliflora. The main research objective was to determine effects of pastoralism and vegetation change on prospects for sustaining the Allideghi Wildlife Reserve as grassland habitat for Grevy 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Zebra.</b> Methods included use of driving surveys to quantify resource use by herbivores, vegetation analysis, and engagement with local people. Resource-use patterns of livestock across the Allideghi grassland were often positively affected by proximity of water, while that for wild ungulates was often negatively affected by proximity of people. Livestock concentration at a major borehole has created a large piosphere with concomitant reductions in herbaceous standing-crop, productivity, and species richness; plant species have shifted from grasses to forbs in severely grazed sites. Vegetation further from the borehole was resilient in response to moderate grazing pressure in terms of species composition and productivity. Since being introduced at a nearby commercial plantation in the 1970 s, P. juliflora has been dispersed to the Allideghi Wildlife Reserve via livestock; cattle, sheep, and goats eat the pods and deposit seeds in manure at settlements and favored foraging areas. Prosopis juliflora greatly reduced species richness and basal cover of native herbaceous vegetation in the Allideghi grassland. Analysis of remotely sensed images from the past 30 years indicated major land-use change in the district due to agricultural expansion as well as land-cover change due to Prosopis encroachment and heavy grazing. Recent efforts have been undertaken by various agencies to control P. juliflora, via harvest in the district, but this has yielded variable and often negative results. Without {{a concerted effort to}} limit livestock grazing and control spread of P. juliflora, the future for the grassland and wildlife at the Allideghi Wildlife Reserve is grim. Agencies and policy makers need to promote science- and community-based approaches to help rectify the situation. (311 pages...|$|R

40|$|Dreissenid mussels {{were first}} {{documented}} in the Laurentian Great Lakes in the late 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Zebra</b> mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) spread quickly into shallow, hard-substrate areas; quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) spread more slowly and are currently colonizing deep, offshore areas. These mussels occur at high densities, filter large water volumes while feeding on suspended materials, and deposit particulate waste on the lake bottom. This filtering activity has been hypothesized to sequester tributary phosphorus in nearshore regions reducing offshore primary productivity. We used a mass balance model to estimate the phosphorus sedimentation rate in Saginaw Bay, a shallow embayment of Lake Huron, {{before and after the}} mussel invasion. Our results indicate that the proportion of tributary phosphorus retained in Saginaw Bay increased from approximately 4670 % when dreissenids appeared, reducing phosphorus export to the main body of Lake Huron. The combined effects of increased phosphorus retention and decreased phosphorus loading have caused an approximate 60 % decrease in phosphorus export from Saginaw Bay to Lake Huron. Our results support the hypothesis that the ongoing decline of preyfish and secondary producers including diporeia (Diporeia spp.) in Lake Huron is a bottom-up phenomenon associated with decreased phosphorus availability in the offshore to support primary production...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1980 <b>s</b> the <b>zebra</b> mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas 1771, {{has become}} the protagonist of a {{spectacular}} freshwater invasion in North America due to its large economic and biological impact. Several genetic studies on American populations have failed to detect any large-scale geographical patterns. In western Europe, where D. polymorpha has been a classical invader from the Pontocaspian since the early 19 th century, the situation is strikingly different. Here, we show with genetic markers that two major western European invasion lineages with lowered genetic variability within and among populations can be discriminated. These two invasion lineages correspond with two separate navigable waterways to western Europe. We found a rapid and asymmetrical genetic interchange of the two invasion lines after {{the construction of the}} Main-Danube canal in 1992, which interconnected the two waterways across the main watershed...|$|R
40|$|ZEBRA {{has been}} shown to {{activate}} model reporter genes consisting of synthetic oligomerized ZEBRA response elements upstream of a minimal CYC 1 promoter fused to beta-galactosidase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here it is shown that in <b>S.</b> cerevisiae <b>ZEBRA</b> activates transcription of natural Epstein-Barr virus promoters. Two Epstein-Barr virus promoters were shown to be activated by <b>ZEBRA</b> in <b>S.</b> cerevisiae: Zp, the promoter that regulates expression of BZLF 1, which encodes ZEBRA; and EAp, the promoter controlling expression of BMRF 1, which encodes diffuse early antigen, EA-D. These observations indicate that neither mammalian-specific nor virally encoded coactivators are obligatory for ZEBRA to stimulate expression from these two promoters. Zp was also strongly activated by endogenous yeast factors. EAp was not activated by yeast factors. The results show that in S. cerevisiae and in B cells, ZEBRA dominates the response of EAp; ZEBRA plus endogenous cell factors activate Zp...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus load {{reduction}} and dreissenid invasion {{are the two}} most important factors that influence europhication dynamics in the Great Lakes. The 1978 amendments to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) between the United States and Canada established target phosphorus loads for the lakes, leading to reductions in external phosphorus loading to the Great Lakes. With diminished phosphorus levels, further nutrient management was a minor concern until the proliferation of invasive dreissenid mussels. Dreissenid mussels were first documented in the Laurentian Great Lakes in the late 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Zebra</b> mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) spread quickly into shallow, hard-substrate areas; quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) spread more slowly and are currently colonizing deep, offshore areas. These mussels have the potential to modify biogeochemical processes and food web structure, altering nutrient cycling and availability. Following the mussel invasion, cyanobacterial blooms and nuisance benthic algal growth have reappeared in many nearshore areas of the Great Lakes. This dissertation characterizes long-term patterns of phosphorus loading and mussel populations for Saginaw Bay, and estimates the effects of load reductions and dreissenid invasion on several aspects of pelagic water quality, focusing on phosphorus flux and cycling in Saginaw Bay. Bayesian approaches were used to quantify the impacts of load {{reduction and}} mussel invasion, {{while at the same time}} addressing model parameter uncertainty and prediction uncertainty associated with long-term observational data. Annual total phosphorus load estimates suggest a decreasing trend until the late 1970 s to early 1980 s, reflecting the effectiveness of point source controls implemented pursuant to GLWQA. Despite the decrease, however, the annual loads have not likely met the 440 tonne yr- 1 target established for Saginaw Bay. In 1990 zebra mussels were discovered in the bay and by 1992 they were widespread and peaked with densities of > 30, 000 m - 2. Following the peak, mean densities dropped and modeling results predict that the density will reach equilibria at ~ 600 m - 2. When mussels appeared, the proportion of tributary phosphorus retained in Saginaw Bay increased from ~ 0. 5 to ~ 0. 7, reducing phosphorus export to the main body of Lake Huron. The combined effects of increased phosphorus retention and decreased phosphorus loading have caused an ~ 60 % decrease in phosphorus export from Saginaw Bay to Lake Huron. The analysis of long-term patterns of pelagic water quality highlights the sustained effects of mussel invasion on altering water quality parameters in Saginaw Bay; there was a consistent decrease in chlorophyll concentrations by ~ 46 %, and total phosphorus concentrations by ~ 25 %, and an increase in secchi depths by ~ 15 % over ~ 20 year invasion of mussels. A comparison of chlorophyll-phospohrus relationship between pre- and post-invasion periods suggest the reduced chlorophyll yield for a given phosphorus concentration after the mussel invasion. Further, decreases in both total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations were found in the majority of 24 mussel-invaded US lakes in addition to Saginaw Bay, and modeling results predict less chlorophyll yields per unit phosphorus level that ranges from oligo- to mesotrophic conditions. All lines of evidence presented in the dissertation point to the important roles of load reductions and invasive mussels affecting eutrophication dynamics in lake ecosystems. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a growing}} concern about {{continued}} impairment of aquatic ecosystems resulting from increasing population size, land use, climate change, and the feedbacks that may harm human well-being. We describe a 100 year multi-disciplinary overview of changes in Lake St. Clair, North America to identify knowledge gaps and needs to build the foundation for creating coupled human and natural system models. Our historical analysis indicates that the socioeconomic dynamics are inextricably linked to the urban dynamics of the Detroit metropolitan area. Environmental degradation and human health issues led to the adoption of relevant policies, including construction of wastewater treatment facilities by the 1960 s. Climate trends during the 100 -year period indicate a wetter region, which is influencing lake levels. Since the mid- 1980 s and 90 <b>s</b> invasive <b>zebra</b> and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugenis) have significantly altered the ecological structure and function of the lake. Waterborne illnesses due to contaminated drinking water were once an issue but current human health risks have shifted to contaminated recreational waters and coastal pollution. Key research needs for building coupled models include geo-referencing socioeconomic and ecological data to accurately represent the processes occurring within the political and watershed boundaries; assessing ecosystem services for human well-being; and developing research hypotheses and management options regarding interactions among land use, people and the lake. Lake St. Clair has gone through extensive changes, both socioeconomically and ecologically over the last 100 years and we suggest that it serves as a useful case study for the larger Great Lakes region...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} biocides (tributyltin, chlorthalonil and Irgarol 1051) and of pollutants (copper, inorganic and methyl mercury and 4 -nonylphenol) occurring in Ebro River (NE Spain) on early developmental stages of native Spanish freshwater and invasive zebra mussels. Toxicity tests were conducted with embryos and glochidia of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the naiad species Unio elongatulus, respectively. Toxicity was quantified in terms of median effective concentration (EC 50) impairing embryogenesis and glochidia viability in single and combined mixture exposures. Irgarol 1051 was not toxic at concentrations below 40 × 103 nM. Zebra mussel embryos were on average 50 fold {{more sensitive to the}} studied pollutants than glochidia. Tributyltin was the most toxic compound with EC 50 <b>s</b> for <b>zebra</b> mussel embryos and glochidia, respectively, of 1. 24 and 47. 93 nM, followed by chlorothalonil (3. 65, 176. 58 nM), methyl mercury (7. 06, 156. 4 nM), inorganic mercury (3. 64, 518. 28 nM), copper (19. 73, 1358. 55 nM) and 4 -nonylphenol (33. 99, 1221. 48 nM). Combined toxicity of Ebro River pollutants (copper, inorganic and methyl mercury and 4 -nonylphenol) was greater than additive in zebra mussel embryos and additive in glochidia. These results indicated that contaminant levels that affect zebra mussel embryos are not toxic to early life stages of the naiad mussel species U. elongatulus.

40|$|ZEBRA, {{a member}} of the bZIP family, serves as a master switch between latent and lytic cycle Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene expression. ZEBRA {{influences}} the activity of another viral transactivator, Rta, in a gene-specific manner. Some early lytic cycle genes, such as BMRF 1, are activated in synergy by ZEBRA and Rta. However, ZEBRA suppresses Rta's ability to activate a late gene, BLRF 2. Here we show that this repressive activity is dependent on the phosphorylation state of ZEBRA. We find that two residues of <b>ZEBRA,</b> <b>S</b> 167 and S 173, that are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK 2) in vitro are also phosphorylated in vivo. Inhibition of ZEBRA phosphorylation at the CK 2 substrate motif, either by serine-to-alanine substitutions or by use of a specific inhibitor of CK 2, abolished ZEBRA's capacity to repress Rta activation of the BLRF 2 gene, but did not alter its ability to initiate the lytic cycle or to synergize with Rta in activation of the BMRF 1 early-lytic-cycle gene. These studies illustrate how the phosphorylation state of a transcriptional activator can modulate its behavior as an activator or repressor of gene expression. Phosphorylation of ZEBRA at its CK 2 sites is likely to play an essential role in proper temporal control of the EBV lytic life cycle...|$|R
