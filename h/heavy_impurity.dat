As a system, we consider a D̅ (B) meson embedded in nuclear matter as a <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> boson with SU(2) isospin symmetry. As another system, we also consider a charm (bottom) quark embedded in quark matter as a <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> fermion with SU(3) color symmetry. We suppose a vector current interaction with SU(n) symmetry (n > 2) for the fermion composing the Fermi surface and the embedded <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> particle, and calculate the scattering amplitude perturbatively for the small coupling constant up to one-loop level. We obtain that the scattering amplitude has a logarithmic enhancement in the large mass limit of the <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> particle, and show that the perturbative calculation breaks down for any small coupling constant in this limit.

40|$|We study a <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> moving {{longitudinal}} {{with the}} direction of an external magnetic field in an anomalous chiral medium. Such system would carry a nondissipative current of chiral magnetic effect associated with the anomaly. We show, by generalizing Landau’s criterion for superfluidity, that the “anomalous component” which {{gives rise to the}} anomalous transport will not contribute to the drag experienced by an impurity. We argue on a very general basis that those systems with a strong magnetic field would exhibit an interesting transport phenomenon—the motion of the <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> is frictionless, in analogy to the case of a superfluid. We demonstrate and confirm our general results with two complementary examples: weakly coupled chiral fermion gases and strongly interacting chiral liquids.

Among the plasma parameters which affect impurity transport, rotation has only recently received the deserved consideration. In addition to the off-diagonal contribution related to the presence of a radial gradient of the toroidal rotation (usually dubbed roto­diffusion), even in moderately rotating plasmas, centrifugal effects of <b>heavy</b> <b>impurities</b> become non-negligible. Plasmas obtained in the hybrid scenario in JET with the ITER-like wall (JETILW) can be used to study these effects on W, since the deuterium toroidal rotation reaches central thermal Mach numbers around 0. 4 (Mach of W up to 3. 8). At the same time, this study allows us to explore the transport mechanisms which are responsible for the central W accumulation which is often observed in this type of discharges...|$|R

An analytic solution of the inelastic Maxwell model shows that a phase transition occurs in the cooling case. Light impurities have similar velocity statistics as the fluid background, although their temperature is generally different. Asymptotically, the temperature ratio increases with the impurity mass, and it diverges at some critical mass. Impurities heavier than this critical mass essentially scatter of a static fluid background. The impurity velocity distribution is generally characterized by multiscaling asymptotic behavior of its moments.

The transport coefficients of high-Z ions in the accumulation stage, reconstructed from the bolometric measurements of radiation losses, are presented. They confirm the neo-classical {{nature of the}} convective particle transport which causes peaking of the impurity density. A mechanism triggering accumulation, invoking the temperature dependence of neo-classical flows of impurities, is discussed and the calculated threshold of the accumulative instability is compared with experimental data. Changes in the flux component proportional to the temperature gradient, caused by the increase of the impurity concentration, are analyzed and it is shown that they can lead to saturation of the accumulation. The possible nature of MHD-modes excited by peaking of the impurity density and flattening of {{the temperature in the}} plasma core is discussed.

40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{relaxation}} dynamics of a single, <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> atom interacting with a finite one- or two-dimensional, ultracold Bose-gas. While {{there is a}} clear separation of time scales between processes resulting from single- and two-phonon scattering in three spatial dimensions, the thermalization in lower dimensions is dominated by two-phonon processes. This is due to infrared divergencies in the corresponding scattering rates in the thermodynamic limit, which are a manifestation of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem. It makes it necessary to include second-order phonon scattering in one-dimensional systems even at T= 0 and above a crossover temperature T_ 2 ph in two spatial dimensions. T_ 2 ph scales inversely with the system size and is much smaller than currently experimentally accessible. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Density {{profiles}} {{for a light}} impurity, boron, {{are reported}} for internal transport barrier (ITB) discharges in Alcator C-Mod. During the ITB, the light impurity gradient steepens because the impurity pinch increases relative to diffusion. The ITB-induced impurity profile steepening is at approximately the same major radius as that for the main-ion profile. Neoclassical transport does not describe the light impurity profiles but transport is closer to neoclassical in the ITB region. In previous work on C-Mod, profiles of seeded <b>heavy</b> <b>impurities</b> (introduced by puffing) peaked during the ITB, but a marked difference between transport of <b>heavy</b> and light <b>impurities</b> has been reported for other tokamaks. With the addition of light impurity profiles described here, the ITB on C-Mod is shown to share additional profile traits with the ITB on other tokamaks.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} interplay of neoclassical, {{turbulent}} and MHD processes, which are simultaneously at play when contributing to impurity transport. It is shown that these contributions are not additive, as assumed sometimes. The interaction between turbulence and neoclassical effects leads to less effective thermal screening, i. e. lowers the outward flux due to temperature gradient. This behavior is attributed to poloidal asymmetries of the flow driven by turbulence. Moreover sawtooth crashes {{play an important role}} to determine fluxes across the q = 1 surface. It is found that the density profile of a <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> differs significantly in sawtoothing plasmas from the one predicted by neoclassical theory when neglecting MHD events.

However, the exact solution for a <b>heavy</b> <b>impurity</b> reveals that both a two-body bound state and distortions of the Fermi sea are crucial. This reflects the importance of particle-hole pairs in lower dimensions and makes simple variational calculations unreliable.
