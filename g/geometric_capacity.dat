40|$|The François Massieu 1869 idea {{to derive}} some {{mechanical}} and thermal properties of physical systems from “Characteristic Functions”, {{was developed by}} Gibbs and Duhem in thermodynamics {{with the concept of}} potentials, and introduced by Poincaré in probability. This paper deals with generalization of this Characteristic Function concept by Jean-Louis Koszul in Mathematics and by Jean-Marie Souriau in Statistical Physics. The Koszul-Vinberg Characteristic Function (KVCF) on convex cones will be presented as cornerstone of “Information Geometry” theory, defining Koszul Entropy as Legendre transform of minus the logarithm of KVCF, and Fisher Information Metrics as hessian of these dual functions, invariant by their automorphisms. In parallel, Souriau has extended the Characteristic Function in Statistical Physics looking for other kinds of invariances through co-adjoint action of a group on its momentum space, defining physical observables like energy, heat and momentum as pure geometrical objects. In covariant Souriau model, Gibbs equilibriums states are indexed by a geometric parameter, the Geometric (Planck) Temperature, with values in the Lie algebra of the dynamical Galileo/Poincaré groups, interpreted as a space-time vector, giving to the metric tensor a null Lie derivative. Fisher Information metric appears as the opposite of the derivative of Mean “Moment map” by geometric temperature, equivalent to a <b>Geometric</b> <b>Capacity</b> or Specific Heat. We will synthetize the analogies between both Koszul and Souriau models, and will reduce their definitions to the exclusive Cartan “Inner Product”. Interpreting Legendre transform as Fourier transform in (Min,+) algebra, we conclude with a definition of Entropy given by a relation mixing Fourier/Laplace transforms: Entropy = (minus) Fourier(Min,+) o Log o Laplace(+,X) ...|$|E

The emerging 3 -D VLSI Integration and process technologies allow the new design opportunities in 3 -D NoC. The 3 -D NoC can reduce significant amount of wire length for local and global interconnects. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient 3 -D Asymmetric Torus routing algorithm for NoC router. The 3 -D torus has constant node degree, recursive structure, simple communication algorithms, and good scalability. A Quadrant-XYZ dimension order routing algorithm is proposed {{to build up the}} 3 -D Asymmetric Torus NoC router. The algorithm partitions the geometrical space into quadrants and selects the nearest wrap-around edge to connect the destination node. Thus, the presented algorithm guarantees minimal paths to each destination based on routing regulations. The complexity of the algorithm is O (n). The proposed routing algorithm has been compared with the traditional XYZ algorithm and the comparison results show that the quadrant-XYZ router has shorter path length.

As users of transport infrastructure, human has close relationship {{to the field of}} transportation. Their driving behavior affects vehicle movements and may cause conflicts. In order to investigate the conflicts such as traffic delay, there are two different calculation methods using SUMO software and IHCM 1997 manually. The objective of this research is to compare the calculation methods of traffic delay using IHCM 1997 and SUMO which more appropriately with the actual condition. The research location is in Idröttsparken roundabout, Norrköping, Sweden which has four arms. The data collection is conducted during three days in the morning and afternoon. Types of data collection in this research were traffic flow and its turning, travel time and queue length. The queue length data is converted into traffic delay data for observation data. In SUMO, the traffic delay value is the mean halting duration. In IHCM 1997, the calculation of traffic delay needs several data i. e. roundabout <b>geometric,</b> <b>capacity,</b> and degree of saturation. To analyze data, the statistical method is used i. e. normality test, parametric and non-parametric test and also linear regression method. The result showed the traffic delay in observation data is higher than delay in SUMO result and IHCM 1997 calculation. The statistical results showed that the traffic delay of SUMO, and IHCM 1997 have no similarities to the observation. Furthermore, from the linear regression result, only SUMO result has the highest value for determination coefficient (R 2) compared to IHCM 1997 as shown in the West and South arms for SUMO result in the morning measurement. It means SUMO more representatives the observation compared to IHCM 1997. It is occurred because SUMO is developed in Europe and also the location for this research is in Sweden, Europe which has very different traffic condition from Indonesia.

30|$|Various {{researches}} {{and studies}} {{were developed in}} Australia focusing on <b>geometric</b> design, <b>capacity</b> and delays at roundabouts (see e.g. [25, 56 – 58]). Troutbeck [59] addressed the problem about suitability of the gap acceptance theory to adequately predict the capacity of a roundabout and developed an analytical equation based on gap acceptance characteristics which were measured at roundabouts operating below capacity. Critical and follow-up headways were related to roundabout geometry and capacity. Based on Troutbeck’s studies for the Australian Road Research Board, some changes to the analysis and design of roundabouts were proposed [56, 60]. Troutbeck’s critical headway research [56 – 60] {{led to the development}} of a lane-based model that considers the conflicting lane gaps as the combination of gaps between the vehicles of the circulating streams; thus, for the right entry lane, all conflicting vehicles have an influence on the entering drivers’ behavior, which will be true in some cases and generally conservative. If a vehicle in the right entry lane enters at the same time as a vehicle is circulating in the inner conflicting lane, the defined accepted gap may be quite small [61].|$|R

The structure and morphology of the electrodeposited films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). As anodes for Li-ion batteries, Li-Si films give high cycling stability, adjustable Li-storage capacity and initial coulombic efficiency under different electrodeposition conditions. For instance, LSF- 3 was electrodeposited in an electrolyte of 0. 5 mol·L- 1 SiCl 4 + 0. 7 mol·L- 1 LiClO 4 +propylene caronate (PC) under certain conditions (i 1 =- 3. 82 mA·cm- 2, t 1 = 600 s; i 2 =- 1. 27 mA·cm- 2, t 2 = 7200 s).

40|$|We {{introduce}} the symplectic structure of information geometry based on Souriau’s Lie group thermodynamics model, with a covariant definition of Gibbs equilibrium via invariances through co-adjoint action {{of a group}} on its moment space, defining physical observables like energy, heat, and moment as pure geometrical objects. Using geometric Planck temperature of Souriau model and symplectic cocycle notion, the Fisher metric is identified as a Souriau <b>geometric</b> heat <b>capacity.</b> The Souriau model is based on affine representation of Lie group and Lie algebra that we compare with Koszul works on G/K homogeneous space and bijective correspondence between the set of G-invariant flat connections on G/K and the set of affine representations of the Lie algebra of G. In the framework of Lie group thermodynamics, an Euler-Poincaré equation is elaborated with respect to thermodynamic variables, and a new variational principal for thermodynamics is built through an invariant Poincaré-Cartan-Souriau integral. The Souriau-Fisher metric is linked to KKS (Kostant–Kirillov–Souriau) 2 -form that associates a canonical homogeneous symplectic manifold to the co-adjoint orbits. We apply this model {{in the framework of}} information geometry for the action of an affine group for exponential families, and provide some illustrations of use cases for multivariate gaussian densities. Information geometry is presented {{in the context of the}} seminal work of Fréchet and his Clairaut-Legendre equation. The Souriau model of statistical physics is validated as compatible with the Balian gauge model of thermodynamics.

40|$|Usually a Riemannian {{geometry}} {{is considered}} to be the most general geometry, which {{could be used as a}} space-time geometry. In fact, any Riemannian geometry is a result of some deformation of the Euclidean geometry. Class of these Riemannian deformations is restricted by a series of unfounded constraints. Eliminating these constraints, one obtains a more wide class of possible space-time geometries (T-geometries). Any T-geometry is described by the world function completely. T-geometry is a powerful tool for the microcosm investigations due to three its characteristic features: (1) Any geometric object is defined in all T-geometries at once, because its definition does not depend on the form of world function. (2) Language of T-geometry does not use external means of description such as coordinates and curves; it uses only primordially geometrical concepts: subspaces and world function. (3) There is no necessity to construct the complete axiomatics of T-geometry, because it uses deformed Euclidean axiomatics, and one can investigate only interesting <b>geometric</b> relations. <b>Capacities</b> of T-geometries for the microcosm description are discussed in the paper. When the world function is symmetric and T-geometry is nondegenerate, the particle mass is geometrized, and nonrelativistic quantum effects are described as geometric ones, i. e. without a reference to principles of quantum theory. When world function is asymmetric, the future is not geometrically equivalent to the past, and capacities of T-geometry increase multiply. Antisymmetric component of the world function generates some metric fields, whose influence on geometry properties is especially strong in the microcosm.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} partitioning a local service region into nonoverlapping work areas in which pickups and deliveries are made throughout the day. For a fleet of homogeneous vehicles, a given set of customers, and expected demand for service, {{the objective is to}} find the least number of work areas or clusters that satisfy a variety of <b>geometric</b> and <b>capacity</b> constraints. Using rectangles as the basic shape, each cluster must have an aspect ratio that falls within certain bounds, as well as meet load and time requirements dictated by the capacity of a vehicle and the working hours in a day, respectively. The latter requirement presents a unique hurdle because travel times are a function of the actual routes followed by the drivers, and are not known, even in a probabilistic sense, until the clusters are formed. A novel aspect of the paper is the method proposed for dealing with this uncertainty. The problem is modelled using a compact set-covering formulation and is solved with an adaptive column generation heuristic. Because {{it is not possible to}} efficiently represent all the constraints in algebraic form, thus allowing a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, a constructive approach was taken. The first step involved generating a subset of attractive clusters from seed customers scattered throughout the service region and then iteratively pricing them out to obtain a relaxed solution to the set-covering model. To find integer solutions, a three-phase variable fixing scheme was designed with the aim of balancing solution quality with runtimes. The full methodology was tested on six data sets provided by an internationally known express package carrier. The results showed that vehicle reductions averaging 7. 6 % could be realized by adopting the configurations derived from the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this investigation is to examine how various material properties, governed by code specification, affect the seismic response of a twelve- story reinforced concrete building. This study incorporates the pushover and response history analysis to examine how varying steel yield strength (Fy), 28 day nominal compressive concrete strength (f’c), modes, and ground motions may affect the base shear capacity and displacements of a reinforced concrete structure. Different steel and concrete strengths {{were found to have}} minimal impact on the initial stiffness of the structure. However, during the post-yielding phase, higher steel and concrete compressive strengths resulted in larger base shear capacities of up to 22 %. The base shear <b>capacity</b> <b>geometric</b> median increased as f’c or Fy increased, and the base shear capacity dispersion measure decreased as f’c or Fy increased. Higher mode results were neglected in this study due to non-convergent pushover analyses results. According to the response history analysis, larger yield and concrete compressive strengths result in lower roof displacement. The difference in roof displacement was less than 12 % throughout. This displays the robustness of both analysis methods because material properties have insignificant impact on seismic response. Therefore, acceptable yield and compressive strengths governed by seismic code will result in acceptable building performance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHOD Variation in wing length among natural {{populations of}} Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is {{associated}} with different vectorial <b>capacities.</b> <b>Geometric</b> morphometrics allowed us to use a more powerful estimator of wing size ('centroid size'), {{as well as to}} visualize the variation of wing shape, to describe the effects of density or food variation at larval stage on 20 anatomical landmarks of the wing of A. aegypti. RESULTS Almost perfect correlations between (centroid) size and larval density or size and larval food were observed in both sexes: a negative correlation with increasing density and a positive one with increasing amount of food. The allometric component of shape change was always highly significant, with stronger contribution of size to shape under food effects. Within each experiment, either food or density effects, and excluding extreme conditions, allometric trends were similar among replicates and sexes. However, they differed between the two experiments, suggesting different axes of wing growth. CONCLUSION Aedes aegypti size is highly sensible to food concentration or population density acting at larval stages. As larger individuals could be better vectors, and because of the stronger effect of food concentration on size, vector control activities should pay more attention in eliminating containers with rich organic matter. Furthermore, as a simple reduction in larval density could significantly increase the size of the survivors, turning them into potentially better vectors, the control activities should try to obtain a complete elimination of the domestic populations...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis presents a framework for interactive assembly sequence panning for mechanical assemblies. Realizing the utility of such a tool that will enable the product engineer to evaluate the assemblability of his designs and generate suitable assembly sequences, many systems have been developed by beseechers all over the world. The input to these system is a model of the assembly and the output is a set of feasible assembly sequences. The system needs a <b>geometric</b> reasoning <b>capacity</b> to aid this process. The research issue is to devise a framework that preserves design rationale and utilizes all the available assembly information to optimize the assembly planning process, reduce the computational complexity associated with extensive geometric reasoning and represent the constraints in the assembly {{in a manner that is}} easy to interpret. This thesis contributes to simplification of the assembly sequence planning by developing a framework to represent and input vital information regarding implicit precedence relationships, directionality and base-part assumptions to the planner. This is achieved by generating three graph structures: an Abstract Assembly Graph, a FinalPrecedence Graph and a Diamond Graph. Extensive autistic geometric reasoning required to reason about the feasibility of assembly operation is often expensive and time consuming and is therefore replaced with a user interface. A question-answer session with the designer to reason about the assemblability will also help in incorporating additional information other than geometric feasibility constraints into the planning process. The process of finding constraints in the assembly is further streamlined by taking a hierarchical approach to set up precedence among all the assembly operations needed to generate the complete assembly. Preserving and utilizing the precedence information from one level to the next in a hierarchy drastically reduces the number of queries needed to find out all the precedence relationships in the assembly. Finally, all the constraint information is represented using a Final Precedence Graph. The Final Precedence Graph serves as the input to the generation of all the feasible assembly sequences that are then represented using a Diamond Graph...|$|R

The dispersion of the VGCNF in the epoxy resin was performed by four different methods: Method 1 : hand mixing with a Haeger blender for 2 min [12], where the velocity field and stress levels should generate a predominantly distributive mixing of the clusters; Method 2 : one pass extrusion through a Capillary Rheometer fitted {{with a series of}} rings with alternating directions [14], where the strong extensional fields are anticipated to result in a good filler dispersion but limited cluster distribution Method 3 : roll milling (using a Lehmann 3 roll miller) for 5 min, with a gap of 25.4 μm {{between the first and second}} rolls and 600 r.p.m. for the third roll, which is expected to result in a good filler dispersion and a relatively good cluster distribution; Method 4 : a planetary-type Thinky ARE- 250 mixer, at revolution and rotation speeds of 2000 and 800 rpm, respectively, for 10 min, which should ensure a good cluster distribution.
