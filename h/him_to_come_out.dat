5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso {{was pulling}} {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E

But, of course, being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mason {{has said}} he was nervous about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I did {{have to stand up}} in front a group of people and tell them , I was gay.

Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport.

500|$|In January 1887 Commodore Perry Owens {{took office}} as Sheriff of Apache County, Arizona. He sent two deputies to arrest Ike Clanton. Clanton had instigated the Gunfight at the OK Corral and {{was charged with}} the later ambush {{shooting}} of Virgil Earp. Wyatt Earp searched for Ike Clanton in his vendetta, but never found him - Ike moved north to Apache County to continue rustling cattle and killing. Owens' two deputies killed Ike Clanton; Phin Clanton was arrested; three other gang members were killed; and the Clanton gang was done. Then Sheriff Owens {{turned his attention to}} the Blevins family, the other rustling gang in the county. In June 1887 Old Man Blevins disappeared, presumably killed by the Tewksbury faction of the Pleasant Valley War. The Blevins sons searched for their father and in August Hamp Blevins and another were killed by the Tewksbury side. So Andy Blevins (aka Cooper) ambushed and killed John Tewksbury and Bill Jacobs in revenge. Blevins returned to Holbrook and was heard bragging about his killings. Sheriff Owens had inherited a warrant for Andy Blevins' (Cooper) arrest for horse theft so he rode to Holbook on September 2, 1887. Sheriff Owens had hunted buffalo for the railroad and could shoot his Winchester from the hip with great accuracy. Cradling his Winchester rifle in his arm, Sheriff Owens knocked on the Blevins' door. Andy Blevins answered with a pistol in hand, the lawman told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out,</b> that he had a warrant for arrest. Blevins refused and tried to close the door. Owens shot his rifle from his hip through the door, hitting Andy Blevins in the stomach. Andy's half-brother, John Blevins, pushed a pistol out the door to Owens' right and fired at the Sheriff. He missed and Owens shot John Blevins in the arm, putting him out of the fight. Owens saw Andy Blevins in the window moving to shoot back. Owens shot through the wall, striking Andy in the right hip - he died that night. Mose Roberts, boarding with the family, jumped out of a side window with a pistol. Sheriff Owens shot him through his back and chest, killing him. Fifteen-year-old Samuel Houston Blevins ran out the front door, with his brother's revolver, and yelled [...] "I'll get him." [...] His mother ran out after him. Owens shot and Sam fell backward, dying in his mother's arms. The shootout took less than one minute and made Owens a legend. In eight months Sheriff Owens had rid Apache County of two notorious gangs of rustlers and killers.|$|E

When [...] Petrelis encountered Gunderson at a gay bar in Alexandria, Virginia, in late June, 1991, Petrelis confronted Gunderson, urging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> and support gay rights. Specifically, Petrelis objected to Gunderson's vote against the Civil Rights Amendment Act of 1991, which would have extended the protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation. Gunderson reportedly replied, [...] "I am out. I'm in this bar aren't I?", dismissing Petrelis. Petrelis grew angry and threw a beverage at his face. Petrelis then called the police on himself. Afterwards, Petrelis contacted journalists to promote the incident. After Petrelis and others made Gunderson's homosexuality public, Gunderson became more supportive of gay issues and more open about his own sexuality.|$|E

The PCB then announced that for Afridi to announce his retirement like that was a breach of his contract and he had 7 days to re-think his decision and reply. However, he insisted that he would not return until the board was replaced, which led to the PCB suspending his contract and fining him 4.5 million rupees ($52,300). Afridi's no-objection certificate (NOC) was also revoked, preventing him from playing for Hampshire. He filed a petition to overturn the sanctions but withdrew it in June from an out-of-court settlement with the PCB where they agreed to sign off his NOC. Afridi's ask for the replacement of the board was also soon partly completed when Ijaz Butt was replaced as PCB chairman, which prompted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of retirement.
