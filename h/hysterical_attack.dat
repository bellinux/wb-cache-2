But the needful {{opportunity}} failed to present itself. She only came downstairs again at tea-time.

"It is {{only too}} true," [...] Kate said, {{trying to speak}} {{concisely}} and clearly so as to enforce conviction, but feeling a choking sensation about her throat, as though an <b>hysterical</b> <b>attack</b> were impending. [...] "My guardian has shut me up here for some weeks, and I firmly believe that he will never let me out alive. Oh, don't, pray don't think me mad! I am as sane as you are, though, God knows, what I have gone through has been enough to shake my reason." ...|$|E

It's a great mistake being soft to people when they make fools of themselves. There, Bell; there's your stupid book, and I won't have any more of it. I believe it was that that did it."

40|$|The serum {{concentration}} of prolactin is frequently increased after single epileptic seizures and has therefore {{been used as}} a method to differentiate between <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> and epileptic seizures. We determined plasma prolactin concentrations in fifteen patients with status epilepticus. Seven patients had absence status, five complex partial and three generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus. Prolactin levels were normal in all patients which indicates that, in contrast to single seizures, status epilepticus is not associated with an increase in serum prolactin...|$|R
25|$|In 1919, March {{returned}} to civilian life but experienced bouts {{of anxiety and}} depression, a common occurrence with returning veterans. The aforementioned experience, of having bayoneted a young, blond German soldier, is recounted in Company K, there attributed to Private Manuel Burt; March suffered <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> at different moments in his life related to the throat and the eyes. He rarely spoke of his own war experiences or awards, though he was later noted to always take his medals with him and to tell war stories on occasion.|$|R
50|$|Restoration {{literature}} {{includes both}} Paradise Lost and the Earl of Rochester's Sodom, the sexual comedy of The Country Wife {{and the moral}} wisdom of Pilgrim's Progress. It saw Locke's Two Treatises on Government, {{the founding of the}} Royal Society, the experiments and the holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> on theatres from Jeremy Collier, the pioneering of literary criticism from Dryden, and the first newspapers. The official break in literary culture caused by censorship and radically moralist standards under Cromwell's Puritan regime created a gap in literary tradition, allowing a seemingly fresh start for all forms of literature after the Restoration. During the Interregnum, the royalist forces attached to the court of Charles I went into exile with the twenty-year-old Charles II. The nobility who travelled with Charles II were therefore lodged for over a decade {{in the midst of the}} continent's literary scene.|$|R
60|$|The tears {{would have}} their course; she could not {{restrain}} them when once they began, and her struggles to check them only brought an increase of them. Her sobs grew so violent that Laura, much alarmed, made a sign to Charlotte to fetch her mother; and Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in haste, found it was indeed {{the beginning of a}} frightful <b>hysterical</b> <b>attack.</b> The bodily frame had been overwrought to obey the mental firmness and composure, and now nature asserted her rights; the hysterics returned again and again, and when it seemed as if exhaustion had at length produced quiet, the opening of a door, or a sound in the distance, would renew all again.|$|E
60|$|Dane, being unpleasantly {{uncertain}} {{what she}} might say or do in an <b>hysterical</b> <b>attack,</b> felt it incumbent on him to soothe her, and laid a hand reassuringly on her shoulder. It is possible that his companion found comfort in the grasp, or instinctively recognized the touch of an honest man, for she {{made no effort to}} evade it. As it happened, the lane was grass-grown and sandy, and the river frothed noisily down a rapid beyond the bridge. Thus neither of them heard the fall of hoofs until a sudden glare of light beat into the face of the man. Fate had decreed that the driver of the approaching vehicle should not only light the lamps a little earlier than usual, but choose the longest road.|$|E

"We must {{search the}} house," [...] the {{inspector}} said; and Mrs. Jorrocks having been brought {{out of her}} room, and having forthwith fainted and been revived again, was ordered to accompany the police in their investigation, which she did in a very dazed and stupefied manner. Indeed, not a word could be got from her until, entering the dining-room, she perceived her bottle of Hollands upon the table, on which she raised up her voice and cursed the whole company, from the inspector downwards, with the shrillest volubility of invective. Having satisfied her soul in this manner, she wound up by a perfect shriek of profanity, and breaking away from her guardians, she regained the shelter of her room and locked herself up there, after which they could hear by the drumming of her heels that she went into a violent <b>hysterical</b> <b>attack</b> upon the floor.|$|E
25|$|Restoration {{literature}} is the English literature written during the historical period {{commonly referred to}} as the English Restoration (16601689), which corresponds to the last years of the direct Stuart reign in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. In general, the term is used to denote roughly homogeneous styles of literature that center on a celebration of or reaction to the restored court of Charles II. It is a literature that includes extremes, for it encompasses both Paradise Lost and the Earl of Rochester's Sodom, the high-spirited sexual comedy of The Country Wife and the moral wisdom of The Pilgrim's Progress. It saw Locke's Treatises of Government, the founding of the Royal Society, the experiments and holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> on theaters from Jeremy Collier, and the pioneering of literary criticism from John Dryden and John Dennis. The period witnessed news become a commodity, the essay develop into a periodical art form, and the beginnings of textual criticism.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, German-speaking {{physicians}} and psychiatrists intensely debated the benefits and risks of treatment by hypnotic suggestion. While practitioners of the method sought to provide convincing evidence for its therapeutic efficacy in many medical conditions, especially nervous disorders, critics pointed to dangerous side effects, including the triggering of <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> or deterioration of nervous symptoms. Other critics claimed that patients merely simulated hypnotic phenomena in order to appease their therapist. A widespread concern was the potential for abuses of hypnosis, either by giving criminal suggestions or {{in the form of}} sexual assaults on hypnotized patients. Official inquiries by the Prussian Minister for Religious, Educational and Medical Affairs in 1902 and 1906 indicated that relatively few doctors practised hypnotherapy, whereas the method was increasingly used by lay healers. Although the Ministry found no evidence for serious harm caused by hypnotic treatments, whether performed by doctors or by lay healers, many German doctors seem to have regarded hypnotic suggestion therapy as a problematic method and abstained from using it...|$|R

The girl was taken to her room, still {{screaming}} and sobbing, while I made inquiries about Brunton. There was no doubt about it that he had disappeared. His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before, and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning. His clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room, but the black suit which he usually wore was missing. His slippers, too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. Where then could butler Brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become of him now? ...|$|E

40|$|In 1999, Slick, Sherman, and Iverson {{presented}} the first diagnostic algorithm {{designed to be}} used to identify levels of “malingered neurocognitive dysfunction (MND). ” The term “definite MND ” was used to designate those individuals who had motive to feign and obtained significantly below chance performance on one or more forced choice paradigms, while “probable MND ” was used to refer to individuals who did not fall significantly below chance on forced choice measures but did have incentive to feign and failed two or more non-forced choice effort measures, or failed one non-forced choice measure and displayed at least one example of non-plausible self-reported symptoms or test data discrepancy. “Possible MND ” was used to identify those individuals with incentive to underperform and who evidenced discrepant information on self-report. However, since the publication of that pivotal and widely cited manuscript, questions have arisen as to whether we are in fact detecting “malingering ” when poor performance on effort indicators is observed. Malingering refers to the conscious, deliberate feigning of symptoms for external gain, but it has long been appreci-ated that non-conscious symptom fabrication, including feigned cognitive dysfunction, can also occur. For example, in Freud’s original reports of individuals with conversion disorder (which involves non-conscious creation of neurological-type symptoms), cognitive complaints were prominent; “Freud’s remarks about Frau Cecile von M indicate that her <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> and neuralgias were accompanied by reversible amnesia and clouding of consciousness ” (Mace...|$|R
5000|$|Americans were {{fascinated with}} {{aviation}} in the 1920s and 1930s {{and refused to}} allow War Department conservatism to block innovation. General Billy Mitchell, {{the deputy director of}} the Air Service sought to wrest control of coastal defense away from the Navy. He went public insisting that his planes could sink battleships any day (a dubious proposition in the 1920s). Mitchell lost his self-control in 1925 when he accused the Navy in a press release of [...] "incompetency, criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense." [...] He received the highly publicized court martial he wanted, and was allowed to expound his theory that air power alone would suffice to win the next big war. He was convicted, and resigned. He became a popular hero and public opinion forced the War Department to strengthen the Air Corps. Mitchell's main argument was air power had to be autonomous—had to be controlled by fliers who understood the new technology, new tactics, new strategies, and who would not waste precious air assets in trying to assist old-fashioned armies and navies. Until his death in 1936 Mitchell, as a civilian, was a tireless prophet of airpower before numerous civilian audiences, but he lost touch with aviation developments and ceased to be influential inside the services.Indeed, his almost <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> made many generals hostile. The Air Corps managed a few publicity stunts, but always seemed to be overshadowed by glamorous civilians like Charles Lindbergh, Howard Hughes or Amelia Earhart. In 1934 President Franklin Roosevelt, feuding with the airline industry, suddenly turned the delivery of air mail over to the Air Corps. Multiple crashes by inexperienced Air Corps pilots in mediocre planes with poor navigation gear emphasized the fragility of the new service, and undercut its claims that in wartime it could perform miracles. Roosevelt, however, had become a firm believer in air power and had behind him both public opinion and Congress. When mobilization began in spring 1940 Roosevelt was as energetic as anyone in expanding the air role, calling for 50,000 planes a year, and sending the best new models to Britain for its war against the Luftwaffe.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates Emilia Pardo Bazán’s fiction {{predicated}} {{on the idea of}} a Galician regional Gothic deriving from elements of English literary tradition and nineteenth-century Spanish costumbrismo. While the recurrent use of Gothic elements in her literary output has been acknowledged and studied by a number of scholars, my investigation aims to shed some light on the reasons why this writer ultimately resorts to this genre. My first level of analysis concentrates on Gothic manifestations in nineteenth-century Spanish fiction, and how Pardo Bazán adopts this genre and adapts it to her Realist and Naturalist conventions. I maintain that the primary choice for the Gothic aesthetic responds to a necessity to portray the most basic features of Galician peculiarities – its distinctive landscape and its rural Volksgeist –. In this way, Edmund Burke’s contribution to the theorization of the Sublime reveals itself to be a satisfactory resource to Pardo Bazán, who was well familiarized with the concept. The use of Gothic elements equally functions as an instrument of social criticism to raise empathy for the backwardness that Galicia suffered during the last third of the nineteenth century. Thus, while addressing the issue of women’s subordination, the author develops distinctive narrative patterns frequently associated with the so-called Female Gothic. Meanwhile, the depictions of rural characters as savage, superstitious and ignorant indicate the author’s preoccupation with the psychological processes of the Gothic and the reactions among the reading public. In depicting the plight of rural Galicia, she is actually making her readers aware of the necessity to bring this region closer to modernity, that is, to Europe. My second level of analysis focuses on the psychological dimension of the Gothic. In the exploration of such motifs as hallucinations, nightmares, uncanny locations, or <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks,</b> Pardo Bazán’s texts call for a psychoanalytic reinterpretation of these terms. If readers of Gothic fiction seek to decipher hidden meanings within texts, I will attempt to demonstrate that a psychoanalytic approach to Pardo Bazán’s use of Gothic fiction happens to be a necessary step to the better understanding of her work. Taking all this into account, this thesis will try to show that the use of Gothic devices Pardo Bazán employs are constant throughout her literary career and help her to describe the distinctive peculiarities of Galicia while functioning as a tool of social criticism...|$|R

60|$|She awoke refreshed, {{and entirely}} herself again, though feeling stunned and bewildered by the all-pervading thought. Caroline dead! It {{seemed as if}} it was not {{otherwise}} {{with the rest of the}} family. Her illness had been so short, that there had been no time to grow familiar with the idea of her danger; and it was the first death in the household that had hitherto been so strong and confident in health,--the first touch that taught them how little the world they loved was an abiding-place. So sudden had been the stroke, that they seemed to pause and stand aghast under it, scarcely conscious how deep the wound might be. Her father went about the house, bowed down and stricken with grief, his tones low, sorrowful, and so gentle when speaking to his children, or to Marian, that they could scarcely be recognised as the same voice; but, without a word, so far as Marian, Clara, or Lionel knew, of his daughter, or of his own feelings. Her mother, already very weak, and suffering most acutely from the remembrance of the coldness with which she had treated her during the last autumn, became so seriously unwell, between a return of influenza, and her extreme depression and nervous hysterical agitation, that Marian and Clara were almost entirely occupied in nursing her, and trying to soothe her. In this work they were little successful. Marian had no hold on her affection, no power of talking soothingly, though most anxious to do what she could, and distressed excessively by her inability to be a comfort in the painful scenes which she was obliged to witness. She almost thought her presence made things worse, and that Mrs. Lyddell wished her away; but poor Clara was so entirely helpless and frightened, clung to her in so imploring a way, and was so incapable, from the restraint that had always subsisted between her and her mother, of saying anything to comfort her, or assuming any direction, that Marian was obliged, for her sake, to be almost always in the room. The only thing Marian could do in the way of consolation was to read aloud; she could not talk of the great thankfulness, peace, and hope which she felt herself, to Mrs. Lyddell, though she could have done so a little, with time, to Lionel, or even Clara; she could only read, and whether this did any good, she knew not. At any rate, it was what she ought to do; and the sound of the voice going on continuously had certainly a calming effect. Walter used daily to come and read, but this she did not seem to like, though she never made any objection; and there was so much reason for guarding against agitation and excitement, that he, never familiar with her, could not venture to attempt speaking to her on the subject of which all their hearts were full. It was only Mr. Lyddell who had any real serviceable influence with her. Her <b>hysterical</b> <b>attacks</b> never came on in his presence, and a few affectionate words or demonstrations from him would soothe the very worst of them. Marian saw so much real tenderness in his character, that she positively began to feel considerable affection for him.|$|R
40|$|Josef Finsterer, 1 John Hayman 21 Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftng, Vienna, Austria; 2 Department of Pathology, University of Melbourne, Victoria, AustraliaBackground: Charles Darwin (CD), “father {{of modern}} biology,” {{suffered}} from multisystem illness from early adulthood. The most disabling manifestation was cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). This study aims at finding the possible cause of CVS in CD. Methods: A literature search using the PubMed database was carried out, and CD&# 39;s complaints, {{as reported in}} his personal writings and those of his relatives, friends, colleagues, biographers, were compared with various manifestations of mitochondrial disorders (MIDs), known to cause CVS, described in the literature. Results: Organ tissues involved in CD&# 39;s disease were brain, nerves, muscles, vestibular apparatus, heart, gut, and skin. Cerebral manifestations included episodic headache, visual disturbance, episodic memory loss, periodic paralysis, <b>hysterical</b> crying, panic <b>attacks,</b> and episodes of depression. Manifestations of polyneuropathy included numbness, paresthesias, increased sweating, temperature sensitivity, and arterial hypotension. Muscular manifestations included periods of exhaustion, easy fatigability, myalgia, and muscle twitching. Cardiac manifestations included episodes of palpitations and chest pain. Gastrointestinal manifestations were CVS, dental problems, abnormal seasickness, eructation, belching, and flatulence. Dermatological manifestations included painful lips, dermatitis, eczema, and facial edema. Treatments with beneficial effects to his complaints were rest, relaxation, heat, and hydrotherapy. Conclusion: CVS in CD was most likely due to a multisystem, nonsyndromic MID. This diagnosis {{is based upon the}} multisystem nature of his disease, the fact that CVS is most frequently the manifestation of a MID, the family history, the variable phenotypic expression between affected family members, the fact that symptoms were triggered by stress, and that only few symptoms could not be explained by a MID.
