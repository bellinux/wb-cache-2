25|$|Immediately {{following}} the decision, both Comcast and Verizon {{issued a statement}} that the <b>Internet</b> <b>will</b> continue to work for consumers. Verizon stated the ruling will result in more innovation and more choice for consumers. AT stated that their commitment to network neutrality will not diminish. Time Warner Cable stated that their commitment to deliver the best service will not be compromised. As part of the Comcast NBC merger, Comcast was required to follow the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 for 7 years. They reiterated this commitment after the trial.|$|E

There have also been efforts to add more computers to schools and universities. E-commerce is likely to take off in the next few years, especially as the use of credit cards is gaining more ground in Morocco.

50|$|Scholars {{are divided}} {{as to whether}} the <b>Internet</b> <b>will</b> {{increase}} or decrease political participation, including online activism. Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the <b>Internet</b> <b>will</b> decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism.|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{disagree}} {{about the impact}} of the Internet on civic and political engagement. Some scholars argue that <b>Internet</b> use <b>will</b> contribute to civic decline, whereas other scholars view the Internet as having a role to play in re-invigorating civic life. This article assesses the hypothesis that <b>Internet</b> use <b>will</b> contribute to further declines in civic life. This article also assesses whether Internet use has a significant effect on civic and political engagement. This paper employs a meta-analysis approach to current research in this area. In total, 38 studies (with 166 effects) are examined. The meta-data provide strong evidence against the Internet having a negative effect on engagement. However, the meta-data do not establish that <b>Internet</b> use <b>will</b> have a substantial impact on engagement. The effects of Internet use on engagement seem to increase across time. The effects are stronger when online news is examined as the measure of Internet use...|$|R
