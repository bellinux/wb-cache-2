5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{decaying}} priory {{was taken}} over by the Landmark Trust in 1969. In the subsequent 20 years restoration work was undertaken. Initially this was to the church and infirmary with the removal of ivy and removal and replacement of the roofs. The infirmary walls had to be <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a concrete ring beam.|$|E
50|$|The spars, bars or stangs {{were usually}} {{made of wood}} and were first {{inserted}} into the socket before being slipped into the groove and then <b>held</b> firmly <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a wedge.|$|R
25|$|Slats {{in either}} the {{horizontal}} or vertical direction are permanently fixed {{to the back of}} the panel, whilst the secondary perpendicular slats remain loose, <b>held</b> solely <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> the upper row. This allows for a degree of movement in the panel, which may warp, subject to changing levels of dampness and atmospheric pressure.|$|R
50|$|An ear spiral is a thick spiral that {{is usually}} worn through the ear lobe. It is worn in ears that have been stretched. It is {{normally}} <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> only <b>by</b> its own downward pressure. Glass ear spirals are shown but many materials are used. Some designs are quite ornate and may include decorative appendages flaring from the underlying concentric pattern.|$|R
5|$|During the game's present, the war {{has ended}} but {{tensions}} are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant chasm called the Scar, <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing. Initially built five centuries before, a disastrous magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty {{years prior to the}} start of the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bell {{began to}} lay off workers on the V-22 {{production}} line following the implementation of defense cuts, which had reduced the US order to about half the originally planned number of aircraft. Production rate went from 40 in 2012 to 22 planned for 2015. Manufacturing robots have replaced older automated machines for increased accuracy and efficiency in production. Large parts are <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> suction cups and measured electronically. Raw materials arrive frozen.|$|E
5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> two straps around his head.|$|E
50|$|Contact 3D {{scanners}} {{probe the}} subject through physical touch, while {{the object is}} in contact with or resting on a precision flat surface plate, ground and polished to a specific maximum of surface roughness. Where the object to be scanned is not flat or can not rest stably on a flat surface, it is supported and <b>held</b> firmly <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a fixture.|$|R
50|$|The outer rim {{comprises}} 28 sections, each 56 ft long, {{which were}} temporarily <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> during construction <b>by</b> {{a pair of}} 275 ft radial struts, prior to being permanently secured by four cables.|$|R
2500|$|Milking {{machines}} are <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> automatically <b>by</b> a vacuum system that draws the ambient {{air pressure down}} from [...] of vacuum.

A milk lift pump draws the milk from the receiving can through large diameter stainless steel piping, through the plate cooler, then into a refrigerated bulk tank.|$|R
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|In {{his role}} of UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, Jarre {{performed}} a concert named Water for Life in Morocco, on 16 December 2006, {{to celebrate the}} United Nations Year of Desertification in the world. The performance {{was in front of}} the Erg Chebbi Dunes of Merzouga, in the Sahara. A free event, it was attended by about 25,000 people. Images of water and the environment were projected onto nine vertical screens, <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> sand which was watered to keep it hard. Several permanent drinking fountains were built on the site, along with a permanent electricity installation. Jarre was accompanied by over 60Moroccan artists.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
50|$|On smaller vessels {{where an}} {{outboard}} motor {{is the source}} of propulsion, the motor is usually mounted on the transom, and <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> either <b>by</b> clamps or metal bolts that go through the transom. In this arrangement, all the power of the motor is transmitted via the transom {{to the rest of the}} vessel's structure, making it a critical part of the vessel's construction.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{behaviors}} are known {{from members of}} the Apinae that are rarely seen in other bees, including the habit of males forming [...] "sleeping aggregations" [...] on vegetation - several males gathering on a single plant in the evening, grasping a plant with their jaws and resting there through the night (sometimes <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> only <b>by</b> the jaws, with the legs dangling free in space).|$|R

5|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a key}} factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone layer {{plays an important role in}} depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.|$|E
5|$|The boards on the {{exterior}} of the barn are made from a mixture of oak, elm and softwoods such as pine and fir. Some are of modern or relatively modern origins; those on {{the south end of the}} barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire. Each side of the barn's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles, which were originally <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> oak pegs. Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs have been replaced by galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay.|$|E
5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism must {{be employed}} in concert with a rotating shutter which blocks light transmittance during {{the motion of the}} film and allows light through while the film is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> usually <b>by</b> one or more registration pins. The intermittent mechanism can be accomplished in many ways, but most often, it is done with sprocket wheels, claws, or pins coupled to the camera or projector drive mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding shorts : Padded support shorts {{sometimes}} worn {{to protect}} the thighs when the player slides into the bases. Some sliding shorts contain a pocket for a protective cup. This is so the player {{does not have to}} wear a jockstrap and sliding shorts at the same time, although many players find the cup is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> better <b>by</b> wearing it in a jockstrap under sliding shorts.|$|R
50|$|A lifting grapple {{is a type}} of {{hardware}} that can be attached to most large, heavy, or bulky objects to provide a feature on the item to which material handling equipment can attach. Lifting grapples sometimes double as tie downs, allowing heavy items to be <b>held</b> firmly <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> providing a point to which ropes or chains can be attached to the item to hold it <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, was <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a special cell that {{compensated for the}} different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature {{had no effect on}} the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{reports said}} the statue was leaning due {{to changes in}} {{groundwater}} level causing movement of the foundations. The statue is not fixed to its foundations and is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> only <b>by</b> its weight. An anonymous official claimed that it had shifted 20 centimetres and was not expected to move much farther without collapsing. A program of monument restoration was developed in 2008-2009, and conservation and restoration work started in 2010.|$|R
2500|$|Atop {{the brick}} {{of the current}} Lena Water Tower is a {{stainless}} steel tank which is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> only <b>by</b> {{the weight of the}} water inside.

25|$|The neck is made {{of light}} wood, with a veneer of {{hardwood}} (usually ebony) to provide durability for the fretboard beneath the strings. Unlike most modern stringed instruments, the lute's fretboard is mounted flush with the top. The pegbox for lutes before the Baroque era was angled back from the neck at almost 90° (see image), presumably to help hold the low-tension strings firmly against the nut which, traditionally, is not glued in place but is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> string pressure only. The tuning pegs are simple pegs of hardwood, somewhat tapered, that are <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> friction in holes drilled through the pegbox.|$|E

50|$|During this period, {{beginning}} with {{the middle and upper}} classes, hose became longer and more fitting, and they reached above the knees. Previously, they were looser and worn with drawers that ranged from knee- to ankle-length. The new type of hose was worn with drawers that reached the knees or above, and they were wide enough at the top to allow the drawers to be tucked into them. They were <b>held</b> up <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>by</b> being attached to the girdle of the drawers.|$|R
