Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

In {{order to}} analyze the effect of mineral powder on the {{high-temperature}} rut <b>resistance</b> and <b>fatigue</b> cracking <b>resistance</b> performance of unaged,short-term and long-term aged asphalt mortar, Dynamic Shear Rheometer(DSR) was used to study different powder/bitumen ratio of asphalt mortar. The results indicate that increasing mineral powder content can improve high-temperature rut resistance performance of asphalt mortar, but decrease its <b>fatigue</b> cracking <b>resistance</b> performance.

5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, <b>fatigue</b> <b>resistance,</b> and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

Various HMA mixes were included in the DT test program and the results were compared with those of the Overlay Tester, also conducted at ambient temperature. Up to 23 commonly used Texas HMA mixes with different mix design characteristics were evaluated and are discussed in this paper. The results indicated that the mix design volumetrics, such as the asphalt binder content and aggregate gradation, {{play a significant role in}} the ductility and <b>fatigue</b> crack <b>resistance</b> potential of HMA mixes. The dense-to fine-graded HMA mixes with high asphalt binder content exhibited better ductility potential and laboratory <b>fatigue</b> crack <b>resistance</b> than the coarse- and open-graded mixes.

25|$|Dithienylethene {{derivatives}} {{have shown}} {{different types of}} photochemical side reactions, e.g., oxidation or elimination reactions of the ring-closed isomer and formation of an annulated ring isomer as a byproduct of the photochromic reaction. In order to overcome the first, the 2-position of the thiophenes is substituted with a methyl group, preventing oxidation of the ring closed form. Also often the two free α-positions on the double bond are connected in a 5 or 6-membered ring in order to lock the double bond into the cis-form. This makes the dithienylethene undergo only open-closed ring isomerization, unconfused by E-Z isomerization. More recently, based on recent findings showing that by-product formation most likely occurs exclusively from the lowest singlet excited state, a superior <b>fatigue</b> <b>resistance</b> of dithienylethenes upon visible-light excitation has been achieved by attaching small triplet-sensitizing moieties to the diarylethene core via a -conjugated linkage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Fatigue is {{the main}} failure mode in {{pavement}} engineering. Typically, micro-cracks originate {{at the bottom of}} asphalt concrete layer due to horizontal tensile strains.

500|$|Because {{titanium}} alloys have {{high tensile strength}} to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, <b>fatigue</b> <b>resistance,</b> high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|E
500|$|Zinc, cadmium {{and mercury}} form a large range of alloys. Among the zinc {{containing}} ones, brass is an alloy of zinc and copper. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium. While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy [...] exhibits ferromagnetism below 35K. Cadmium {{is used in}} many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, due to a low coefficient of friction and <b>fatigue</b> <b>resistance.</b> It {{is also found in}} some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal. Because it is a liquid, mercury dissolves other metals and the alloys that are formed are called amalgams. For example, such amalgams are known with gold, zinc, sodium, and many other metals. Because iron is an exception, iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum, tungsten and platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam reacts with air to give aluminium oxide, small amounts of mercury corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the study of}} the static behaviour of stud shear connectors welded through profiled sheeting and the <b>fatigue</b> <b>resistances</b> of the connectors in composite bridges. In the presence of profiled sheeting in a composite beam, the resistance of stud connectors to static shear is influenced by the geometry of the ribs and the position of the studs within them. This is allowed for in the existing methods by applying a reduction factor to the resistance of the stud in a solid slab, but a study of the results of 203 push-out tests showed that the influences are not taken into account properly. The reason, revealed by 16 new push-out tests with transverse sheeting and 18 with parallel sheeting, is that the existing methods do not distinguish between the various failure modes. New conceptual and mathematical models are developed with respect to the different failure modes. For transverse sheeting, up to nine parameters are involved, among which five are shown by statistic analyses to have negligible influence. Based on the other four, simpler expressions for reduction factors are derived, and the characteristic resistances (5...|$|R

The effect of alkaline etching on the anodizing {{behavior of the}} alloy in both acidic and neutral electrolytes has been investigated by comparing the electrochemical responses and the resultant anodic films of mechanically polished and alkaline etched alloys. It was revealed that alkaline etching could locally remove intermetallics from the alloy surface, with development of a copper-enriched layer immediately beneath a residual alumina film of about 5 nm thickness. The “footprints ” of alkaline etching, i. e. the removal of intermetallics {{and the formation of}} copper-enriched layer during alkaline etching, could affect subsequent anodizing behavior of the alloy, particularly in the early stages.
