5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site <b>fidelity,</b> {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this <b>fidelity</b> can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate <b>fidelity,</b> with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site <b>fidelity</b> being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{a region}} of <b>fidelities</b> for qubit which is {{obtained}} after an application of a 1 -> N universal quantum cloner. We express the allowed region for <b>fidelities</b> in terms of overlaps of pure states with irreps of S(n) (n = N+ 1) showing that the pure states can be taken with real coefficients only. Subsequently, the case n = 4, corresponding to a 1 -> 3 cloner is studied in more detail as an illustrative example. To obtain the main result, we make a convex hull of possible ranges of <b>fidelities</b> related to a given irrep. The formalism allows to construct the state giving rise to a given N-tuple of <b>fidelities.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, final version to appear in Physics Letters...|$|R

In this work we combine geometrical and probabilistic aspects of the ensemble {{in order to obtain}} useful bounds for Chi. This is done by constructing various correlation matrices involving <b>fidelities</b> between every pair of states from the ensemble. For K= 3 quantum states we design a matrix of root <b>fidelities</b> that is positive and the entropy of which is conjectured to upper bound Chi. Slightly weaker bounds are established for arbitrary ensembles. Finally, we investigate correlation matrices involving multi-state <b>fidelities</b> in relation to the Holevo quantity.

40|$|Generating {{entanglement}} {{by simply}} cooling a system into a stationary state which is highly entangled has many advantages. Schemes {{based on this}} idea are robust against parameter fluctuations, tolerate relatively large spontaneous decay rates, and achieve high <b>fidelities</b> independent of their initial state. A possible implementation of this idea in atom-cavity systems has recently been proposed by Kastoryano et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 090502 (2011) ]. Here we propose an improved entanglement cooling scheme for two atoms inside an optical cavity which achieves higher <b>fidelities</b> for comparable single-atom cooperativity parameters C.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{realization}} of a Toffoli gate with superconducting qubits in a circuit-QED setup using quantum-control methods. Starting with optimized piecewise-constant control fields acting on all qubits and typical strengths of XY-type coupling between the qubits, we demonstrate that the optimal gate <b>fidelities</b> are affected only slightly by a "low-pass" filtering of these fields with the typical cutoff frequencies of microwave driving. Restricting ourselves to the range of control-field amplitudes for which the leakage to the non-computational states of a physical qubit is heavily suppressed, we theoretically predict that {{in the absence of}} decoherence and leakage, within 75 ns a Toffoli gate can be realized with intrinsic <b>fidelities</b> higher than 90 %, while <b>fidelities</b> above 99 % can be reached in about 140 ns.
