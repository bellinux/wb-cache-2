With this interest in colour, many windows depict atmospheric effects. Sunsets, glowering storm clouds and blazing glories appear behind the figures.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flashed</b> <b>glass</b> – is glass {{which is}} made by dipping the blowing rod, or [...] "pontil", into one colour then a second, and {{sometimes}} a third, before blowing to a sheet. The resulting sheet has {{a thin layer of}} a darker colour [...] "flashed" [...] over a paler colour. The dark colour can be removed, or partially removed, by abrading or etching. It is frequently used for heraldry.|$|E

[...] While Charles Eamer Kempe made many windows that were traditional and [...] "safe", he designed others that are clearly aesthetic. Christopher Whall and, in America, Tiffany were Aesthetic designers.|$|E

2500|$|They had ways of {{depicting}} rays {{of light}} that {{they put into practice}} ten years before most of their rivals attempted such dramatic atmospheric effects in the 1870s. The thing that makes these [...] "special effects" [...] of Clayton and Bell the more remarkable is that they were achieved with little resource to painted glass and <b>flashed</b> <b>glass</b> and without the multi-coloured Favrile glass used by Louis Comfort Tiffany studios and the Aesthetic designers of the United States. In fact, they used little more than radiating bands of red, yellow and white glass coupled with a formalised style of cloud painting that had been used by ancient stained glass and panel painters. The effects achieved by apparently simple means are often of overwhelming impact. A renowned example that is reproduced in various books on the topic of stained glass is the Last Judgement window of St Mary’s church, Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, dating from 1860.|$|E

60|$|One day, I do {{not know}} whether it was in the morning or afternoon, I raised my head, and on the horizon I saw a steamer. Quick as a <b>flash</b> my <b>glass</b> was brought to bear upon it.

It was not Bertha's steamer; it was an ordinary steamer with its deck parallel with the water and a long line of smoke coming out of its funnel. The shock of the disappointment was very great.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flashed</b> <b>glass</b> {{also known}} as flash glass {{is a type of}} glass. It is created by coating a colorless piece of glass with one or more thin layers of colored glass.

60|$|Such were Betty Flanders's {{letters to}} Captain Barfoot--many-paged, tear-stained. Scarborough is seven {{hundred miles from}} Cornwall: Captain Barfoot is in Scarborough: Seabrook is dead. Tears made all the dahlias in her garden {{undulate}} in red waves and <b>flashed</b> the <b>glass</b> house in her eyes, and spangled the kitchen with bright knives, and made Mrs. Jarvis, the rector's wife, think at church, while the hymn-tune played and Mrs. Flanders bent low over her little boys' heads, that marriage is a fortress and widows stray solitary in the open fields, picking up stones, gleaning a few golden straws, lonely, unprotected, poor creatures. Mrs. Flanders had been a widow for these two years.|$|R

50|$|While {{very pale}} green is the typical colour of {{transparent}} glass, deeper greens {{can be achieved}} by the addition of Iron(II) oxide which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with chromium it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make wine bottles.The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for <b>flashed</b> <b>glass.</b> Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields emerald green glass.|$|E
50|$|Each Station {{is made of}} two {{sheets of}} glass in the same frame. One is a <b>flashed</b> <b>glass</b> {{carefully}} etched to subtly grade the colour across the sheet. The other carries the image which is printed onto the glass with an iron oxide pigment and fired in the kiln. The distance between the two sheets and the transparency of the glass give internal reflections that soften the image and create a kind of dreamy quality.|$|E
50|$|Both modern {{windows in}} the side chapels are made of <b>flashed</b> <b>glass</b> {{imported}} from France. A flash is {{a thin layer of}} colour applied over a clear base, and this thin layer can be etched away with hydrofluoric acid to show the underlying colourless glass or to give any shade between the original deep blue (or red) to the palest tint. The firm shapes of the letters and hearts were made using a plastic film to resist the acid and the more organic textures were created using a bituminous resist.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Images of Coal," [...] Neil Walker, Keeper of Art at Nottingham Castle Museum, {{was quoted}} as saying: [...] "..the figurative works are {{perhaps some of the}} most spontaneous...with {{passages}} of dashing 'Piper-like' brushwork and dramatic <b>flashes</b> of stained <b>glass</b> colours illuminating inky blackness. The juxtaposition of these images of past toil with the contemporary landscapes, bereft of human acvivity, is a poignant one." ...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "opalescent glass" [...] is {{commonly}} used to describe glass where more than one color is present, being fused during the manufacture, as against <b>flashed</b> <b>glass</b> in which two colors may be laminated, or silver stained glass where a solution of silver nitrate is superficially applied, turning red glass to orange and blue glass to green. Some opalescent glass was used by several stained glass studios in England from the 1860s and 1870s onwards, notably Heaton, Butler and Bayne. Its use became increasingly common. Opalescent glass {{is the basis for}} the range of glasses created by Tiffany.|$|E
50|$|Quarries may be mould-cast into {{patterns}} such as fleur de lys and imprinted {{with black}} and yellow stain. Used extensively during the 19th century in England and Commonwealth countries, these quarries are often {{the product of a}} single studio, James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars. Another form of decorative quarry is the etched or engraved quarry, which is made of <b>flashed</b> <b>glass,</b> most often ruby red or royal blue over a transparent layer. It then has a design cut into it using either acid or a lathe, the character of the resultant design differing accordingly. Etched quarries of Venetian glass are often employed, sometimes in conjunction with panels of stained glass, particularly in Italy and Eastern Europe. Lathe-cut quarries with a simple star-burst pattern are very common in the late 19th century domestic architecture of many regions, both in leadlighting and in simpler wooden-framed glazing.|$|E
60|$|I {{was more}} at home when Haldane turned the {{conversation}} upon practical matters, such as wheat and cattle, than when discussing abstract possibilities; but I afterwards remembered that my fair companion's speech was prophetic, and, as I glanced about, {{it struck me that}} there were dramatic possibilities in the situation. We were a strangely assorted company, and to one who had spent eight years in the wilderness the surroundings were striking. Tall wax candles in silver standards, flickering a little when the impact of the snow-laden gale shook the lonely dwelling, lighted the table. The rest of the long room was wrapped in shadow, save when the blaze from the great open hearth flung forth its uncertain radiance. The light <b>flashed</b> upon cut <b>glass</b> and polished silver, and forced up against the dusky background the faces of those who sat together.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for the precise location of cosmic rays in a magnetic spectrograph. The technique uses the neon flash tube first introduced by Conversi and his co-workers. In this technique ionising particles give rise to visible <b>flashes</b> in a <b>glass</b> tube containing neon. The thesis describes a systematic study of the flash tubes {{over a wide range}} of parameter. Tubes have been constructed having the properties required for operation in a spectrograph and a description is given of the operation of a prototype spectrograph. The accuracy of track location {{has been found to be}} at least as great as that in conventional cloud chambers. The theoretical aspect of the operation of the tubes is discussed and a new mechanism is postulated for tubes filled at high pressures. The design and construction of part of the large spectrograph is described...|$|R
60|$|The {{run of the}} Accelerated was at {{that time}} {{regarded}} as a national exploit, forming, as it did, part of a new link binding Japan and London--the East and the West; and I knew the conductor would hardly have waited for one of his own directors. The white streak rapidly grew larger; something sparkled beneath it, and there was <b>flash</b> of twinkling <b>glass</b> through the dust and steam. I fixed my eyes on the station, and taxed every aching sinew in hand and heel, for the weakening beast must bring me there in time or die. A smoke cloud, with bright patches beneath it, rolled up to the station when I was nearly half a mile away. The horse was reeling under me, the power had gone out of the leaden hands on switch and bridle, and--for the tension had produced a vertigo--my sight was almost gone.|$|R
