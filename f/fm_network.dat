The Radio Authority decided, however, that 105–108MHz would be licensed to new local and regional stations and Virgin Radio applied for and won one of the new FM licences advertised in London as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{relay network}} opened between 1960 and 1968 {{and covered the}} {{segments}} Oslo–Bergen, the coast from Oslo via Kristiansund, Bergen, Stavanger and Ålesund to Trondheim, and from Oslo via Trondheim north to Kirkenes. NRK had to its disposition four 15-kHz mono analog program channels. The government accelerated construction of transmitters in 1966, and by 1971 seventy-nine {{percent of the population}} had access to television coverage. In 1970 the network consisted of 39 main television transmitters and 266 smaller transmitters and frequency converters. The <b>FM</b> <b>network</b> consisted of 36 main transmitters and 126 smaller transmitters and frequency converters. The investments cost NOK200 million—the increase caused by a combination of inflation and under-budgeting. The operational costs remained at the budgeted levels.|$|E
25|$|The single {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2009. After making its radio debut on November 30 on the Tokyo FM School of Lock! radio program, FM radio stations across Japan began {{to give the}} song airplay in early December. At the same time, the song was used in television commercials for winter clothing brand Kissmark, which gained attention for the song. On December 2, the song was released as a downloadable ringtone. The full-length song was released to digital outlets Recochoku and iTunes on January 6, followed by a wide-release of the physical single on January 13. On January 17, the band performed a live concert broadcast on the Japan <b>FM</b> <b>Network</b> program Au Onair Music Chart, from Tokyo FM's Spain-zaka studio.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a {{television}} network started with a microwave radio relay in the super high frequency band. The backbone of the system was a two-way 960 telephone channel, a one-way television channel network and additional communications lines in a third channel in Southern Norway. These lines could be rerouted {{if one of the}} relay stations fell out. It was supplemented with a redundant 300 telephone channel network. The relay network largely used the same masts as were used for television transmission, which was why the Telegraphy Administration was chosen instead of NRK. The 1957 plan called for seventy to eighty percent of the population having television coverage within twelve years. This was budgeted to cost NOK70 million, consisting of 28 transmitters and 19 frequency converters. The <b>FM</b> <b>network</b> would be built in parallel, with 37 transmitters and 10 frequency converters.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom and New Zealand until {{recently}} shared an FM broadcasting allocation of 88.0 – 105.0MHz. This smaller allocation (less than 20MHz , typical of FM {{in the rest}} of the world) can be traced to the 405 line system's VHF allocation block. The UK adopted the 405 line system but NZ did not. NZ's allocation for FM remained smaller as if NZ had adopted the 405 line system. New Zealand considered adopting the 405 line system in the late 1950s to early 1960s but adopted PAL instead. This impacted the frequency allocation block for FM broadcasting making it smaller. New Zealand's FM frequency allocation issue was not fixed until the late 1990s, when the band was expanded to the full 20MHz. Both New Zealand and the United Kingdom have the standard global allocation of 88.0 – 108.0 for FM now. NZ permits Radio Data System subcarriers, but their adoption is not universal. Radio NZ uses RDS for its <b>FM</b> <b>network,</b> but commercial radio's adoption of the technology is not universal.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 Norkring {{stated that}} they were {{interested}} in entering the market in Wallonia, Belgium, and Poland. The Vigra Transmitter was closed in 2011 and Røst followed the following year, leaving Ingøy as the only AM transmitter in Norway. The Parliament of Norway decided in 2011 that the <b>FM</b> <b>network</b> would be closed in 2017 or 2019, with full coverage being ready in 2014. The only parliamentary party to oppose the transition was the Progress Party. The decision resulted in a large-scale expansion of the DAB network in Norway. NRK stated that the longer overlap period, compared to that of television, would give significantly higher broadcasting costs. Following the closure of TV3 in February 2012 and as all other channels were being broadcast on Multiplex A, Norkring decided to close its Slovenian network. Norkring was awarded the second DAB multiplex in an auction held by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority in 2012, where the company bid NOK4 million. The multiplex has a capacity for fifteen DAB+ channels.|$|E
