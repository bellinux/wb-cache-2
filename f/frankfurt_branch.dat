5|$|Following the British {{declaration}} of war with Germany on 4 August 1914, Speyer resigned as a partner of the <b>Frankfurt</b> <b>branch</b> of the bank. After a Royal Proclamation on 11 September 1914 requiring British subjects to have no links with companies doing business with Germany, Speyer resigned as a partner of the American bank. Nonetheless, suspicions regarding Speyer's German parentage led to a hate campaign against him. Crowds gathered outside his home and jeered visitors. Accusations of his disloyalty and treachery appeared in the Press, and {{he was accused of}} signalling to German submarines from his Norfolk house. Lady Speyer was ostracised from societies and associations of which she had formerly been a member. Speyer was asked to resign from the board of the Poplar Hospital due to threats of substantial reductions in donations if he remained. The couple was asked to remove their children from school as other parents were threatening to remove theirs.|$|E

The Elvis impersonator and his Wackel-Elvis were {{picked up by a}} friendly fellow driver - played by German actress Karina Krawczyk - in an Audi equipped with the new transmission. The punch line of the commercials was that {{due to the lack of}} shifting motion while accelerating with the continuously variable transmission the Audi was equipped with, the Wackel-Elvis dashboard figure did not wobble as it had done in the Elvis impersonator's car before it broke down, causing disappointment for the impersonator.|$|R

5000|$|Never the high-powered {{intelligence}} unit Stimson had wanted and, after SHAEF was dissolved, an orphan shared administratively by the US Group Control Council and USFET without being adopted by either, FIAT eventually came by its distinctive {{role in the}} occupation almost inadvertently. In the summer of 1945, from its office in <b>Frankfurt</b> and <b>branches</b> in Paris, London, and Berlin, it provided accreditation, support, and services to civilian investigators from the Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee (Foreign Economic Administration) then arriving in Europe in large numbers to comb German plants and laboratories for information on everything from plastics to shipbuilding and building materials to chemicals. As military units that had been engaged in gathering technical intelligence were redeployed {{beginning in the late}} summer, FIAT frequently also became the custodian of the documents and equipment they had collected.Meanwhile, in June, President Truman had established the Publications Board under the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion and instructed it to review all scientific and technical information developed with government funds during the war with a view toward declassifying and publishing it. In August, after V-J Day, the President also ordered [...] "prompt, public and general dissemination" [...] of scientific and industrial information obtained from the enemy and assigned this responsibility as well to the Publication Board. At first informally and later, in December, by War Department order, FIAT acquired the responsibility for the Publication Board program in Germany and a mission, which was the same one in fact that had been foreseen for it in June, namely, to exploit Germany's scientific and industrial secrets {{for the benefit of the}} world. As the military intelligence projects were completed and phased out in late 1945 and early 1946, the volume of civilian investigations increased; FIAT microfilming teams ranged across Germany, and the Frankfurt office screened, edited, and translated reports before shipping them to the United States. By the end of the first year of the occupation, FIAT had processed over 23,000 reports, shipped 108 items of equipment (whole plants sometimes were counted as single items), and collected 53 tons of documents.|$|R

Merian published her first book of natural illustrations, titled Neues Blumenbuch, in 1675 at age 28. [1] In 1699, following eight years of painting and studying, and on the encouragement of Cornelis van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck, the then-governor of the Dutch colony of Surinam, the city of Amsterdam awarded Merian a grant to travel to South America with her daughter Dorothea. [2] After two years there, malaria forced her to return to Europe. [1][2] She then proceeded to publish her major work, Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium, in 1705, for which she became famous. Because of her careful observations and documentation of the metamorphosis of the butterfly, she is considered by David Attenborough[3] to be among the most significant contributors to the field of entomology. She was a leading entomologist of her time and she discovered many new facts about insect life through her studies.

In 1701 malaria possible forced her to return to the Dutch Republic. Back in the Netherlands, Merian sold specimens she had collected and published a collection of engravings of plant and animal life in Suriname.
