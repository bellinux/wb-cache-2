After graduating in civil engineering he started his own manufacturing unit called LEO Engineering Works in 1975.

40|$|Previous papers {{related to}} the {{optimization}} of pressure vessels have considered the optimization of the nozzle independently from the <b>dished</b> <b>end.</b> This approach generates problems such as thickness variation from nozzle to <b>dished</b> <b>end</b> (coupling cylindrical region) and, as a consequence, it reduces the optimality of the final result which may also {{be influenced by the}} boundary conditions. Thus, this work discusses shape optimization of axisymmetric pressure vessels considering an integrated approach in which the entire pressure vessel model is used in conjunction with a multi-objective function that aims to minimize the von-Mises mechanical stress from nozzle to head. Representative examples are examined and solutions obtained for the entire vessel considering temperature and pressure loading. It is noteworthy that different shapes from the usual ones are obtained. Even though such different shapes may not be profitable considering present manufacturing processes, they may be competitive for future manufacturing technologies, and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the actual influence of shape in the behavior of pressure vessels.

40|$|Canister testing Chamber {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components in Defence Organization. Unavailability of data and literature regarding Missile Canister, are considered to be one of the main contributors for the failure of manufacturing Canister Chambers in a local industry. Canister is used for carrying, storing and launching of missile. During storage and launching, the canister is subjected to an internal pressure of 45 kg/cm 2 and external pressure of 9 kg/cm 2. So it is very important to test the canister for these pressures. A Canister testing chamber is used to test the canister for both internal and external pressures. For testing the canister it’s both ends shall be closed by dummy dished ends. The test chamber will be used for testing of the integrated canister assembly for an external pressure of 9 kg/cm 2 and internal pressure of 45 kg/cm 2. As the testing chamber is subjected to these high pressures it shall be tested for any leakages through the hinged <b>dished</b> <b>end.</b> So the analysis of contact gap between this <b>dished</b> <b>end</b> and the shell of the chamber is to be done. To estimate the contact gap analysis a three-dimensional model of a canister testing chamber was made by finite element method using Uni Graphics...|$|E

Generally the hand hole pipe and <b>dish</b> <b>end</b> component are provided in the header for the inspecting the inner surface of the header. Conventionally the welding of <b>dish</b> <b>end</b> with hand hole pipe of the header is carried out using manual GTAW welding process for root pass and manual SAW welding process for filler passes which is a time consuming process. Thus it is substituted with a semi-automatic welding process i. e., STT- root pass followed by the pulsed GMAW for filler passes through a newly designed welding positioner. This semi-automatic welding process optimizes the cycle time and increases the productivity rate. Also the new welding process – STT and P-GMAW is established by following optimization technique of Taguchi’s orthogonal array method and ensuring the weld quality performance through X-Radiography, mechanical tests impact test and hardness test.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{pressure}} vessel industry has adopted Zick’s {{method of analysis}} for twin saddle supported cylindrical pressure vessels as a ‘design tool ’ {{for the evaluation of}} the stresses at critical locations. It has been recognised for some time that this treatment underestimates stress levels in the horn region by up to 50 % is some cases. Using an improved shell analysis employing Fourier series solutions, more accurate stress data can be generated, however a complete analysis must be performed for each new case. Since this analysis can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, a simpler ‘design method ’ was proposed by the present authors, Tooth and Nash (1991). This is based on an extensive parameter study using the improved shell analysis, allowing the leading parameters to be varied and their effects on the horn peak stress to be examined. The choice of Fourier series used in the analysis implied that the cylinder has totally rigid ends, however, in practice, dished ends are usually hemispherical, semi-ellipsoidal or flat in profile, each possessing some degree of flexibility. Results of extensive finite element studies are presented which show the influence of the <b>dished</b> <b>end</b> flexibility on the peak stress in the vessel at the location of the horn of the saddle. This allows the generation of a new ‘end flexibility factor ’ for incorporation into the simple design method already presented...|$|E

30|$|Unit {{operation}} # 2 utilizes {{a specifically}} designed retort chamber that operates in the 1400 – 1550  F (760 – 843  °C) range. The retort {{is a long}} cylinder {{with a series of}} internal spiral flights. The retort was manufactured from a wrought alloy, RA- 330, that is suitable for the temperature range (i.e., 1700  F (927  °C) maximum) and not reactive with the pyrolysis compounds. The outer casing was designed to withstand 345  kilopascals (50  psig) internal pressure. The vessel and <b>dished</b> <b>ends</b> were constructed of mild steel plates per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) boiler pressure vessel codes. Ceramic fiber modules, 25  cm thick and 10  in. thick with a density of 160  kg/m 3, were provided and stud welded to the furnace sidewalls, roof, and discharge end wall. The retort rotates around its longitudinal axis such that the spiral flights convey the feedstock from end to end in a defined period of time. Various devices (e.g., bars and rakes) are used between the flights to cause the feedstock to tumble and improve the rate of heat transfer.|$|R

40|$|Metallic thin shell {{structures}} {{are used in}} different branches of industry, and the components of these structures such as <b>dished</b> <b>ends</b> show different modes of failure depending upon the geometrical and loading conditions. These are mainly gross plastic deformation under static load, loss of stability (buckling), fatigue crack initiation at highly stressed locations under cyclic loading (especially in the low cycle regime), progressive plastic deformation (ratcheting) and creep at high temperatures. In this paper, failure modes of a conical pressure vessel subjected to internal pressure has been investigated. Also, to study the effect of vessel geometry, a set of conical cylindrical vessels with the cap-cone apex half angles of 20 to 85 degrees, internal radius of 500 to 1000 mm and thickness of 1 to 10 mm has been selected. The failure modes of these vessels which include gross plastic deformation and bifurcation buckling have been taken into account. In this work, a new plastic criterion has been established {{which is based on}} the plastic work dissipation in the vessel by increasing the internal pressure. This plastic criterion can be used for structures subjected to single or a combination of loading condition. The calculated plastic limit loads, which have been obtained using the plastic criterion, are determined purely by the inelastic response of the vessel, and they are not altered by initial elastic behavior. In addition, a design graph for designing pressure vessels with conical heads subjected to internal pressure ha...|$|R
