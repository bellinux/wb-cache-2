For AOD applications, the Dolomite bricks should have positive Permanent Linear Change (PLC) on re-heating. A positive PLC <b>dolomite</b> <b>brick</b> has higher life and most suitable for joint less refractory lining with no cobble stoning defect. So the development of dolomite bricks having positive PLC during applications is a challenge for refractory manufacturing industry. In the present investigation, dolomite refractory bricks were prepared by varying different additive with an intention to get the positive PLC of the brick. It is well known that Iron Oxide is a good additive for <b>dolomite</b> <b>brick</b> sintering. It has also been reported that monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO 2) additive improves the BD, CCS and PLC of <b>dolomite</b> <b>brick.</b> In this background, first trial composition was containing a fixed amount of 1 % m-ZrO 2 and different concentration and types of iron oxide. Mill scale containing Fe 2 O 3 was added in two different concentrations 0. 5 %, 1 % and in another trial 0. 25 % of nano Fe 2 O 3 was added. Fe 2 O 3 containing bricks showed a good improvement in BD and CCS due to the better sintering of dolomite grains in presence of liquid formation during sintering by the presence of Fe 2 O 3. The CCS value was in the range 750 - 800 kg/cm 2. However, the PLCvalue was negative in the range of - 0. 2 to - 0. 35 %. Depending on this result, new additive, Chrome Green oxide was then used. It has been found that the PLC tends to be positive with increase in Cr 2 O 3 content. However, in presence of Cr 2 O 3 the m ZrO 2 it was not performing well. Finally m-ZrO 2 was removed and a higher percentage of Cr 2 O 3 additive showed the positive PLC (+ 0. 12 %) of the <b>dolomite</b> <b>brick.</b> The brick showed a CCS value of 650 kg/cm 2. This is in the acceptable limit...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop laboratory-scale {{technologies}} for composting milk/cheese whey, spent liquor, brewery yeast, fish processing by-products, etc., adding these by-products and special microorganism associations to the basic material - sawdust, bark, etc., also arranging different experimental composting sites. Two Trichoderma strains (Tr. lignorum, Tr. viride) and a nitrification association for regulating the circulation of nitrogen-ammonification and nitrification processes were applied. Monitoring of the composting quality was realised by microbiological and chemical analyses, and biotests for compost quality (toxicity) assessment. For purifying the polluted air from the composting facilities, the biofiltration technique was realised in a modified SSF system. Biodegradation of ammonia was investigated in a two-stage system with the inert packing material - <b>dolomite</b> broken <b>bricks,</b> and hemoautotrophic microorganisms: DN- 1 (Pseudomonas sp.), DN- 2 (Nitrosomonas sp.), DN- 3 (Nitrobacter sp.) and DN- 13 (Sarcina sp.). For hydrogen sulphide biodegradation, Thiobacillus thioparus- 3 was immobilised on glass bricks as the carrier material. Biodegradation efficiency of hydrogen sulphide was 87 %. Biodegradation of ammonia in the first step in the two-stage system reached 77 %, degradation of the gas remaining in the second step was 75 %. Compost's quality was similar to black soil - brown-coloured, with good soil odour and without toxic compounds...|$|R
