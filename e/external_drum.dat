5000|$|In the {{circumpolar}} regions {{the drums}} have been classified by traits {{such as the}} knob, frame design, size, membrane motifs, ornaments, etc. There are therefore two main groups of drums: those with internal and those with <b>external</b> knobs. <b>Drums</b> with internal knobs are found amongst the Tjuktjer in Asia and among North American Inuit. <b>Drums</b> with <b>external</b> knobs are more widespread and are divided into four types: ...|$|R
50|$|CTP methods differ {{according}} to the construction type of the imagesetter and the light source used to expose the plate surface. In terms of construction type there are three different kinds: internal drum, <b>external</b> <b>drum</b> and flat-bed imagesetters. The two main light sources used to expose the plate are ultraviolet light lamps and laser diodes. The wavelength and energy of the laser diodes depend {{on the type of}} plate that is used. This technology is mainly used in newspaper and magazine printing.|$|E
50|$|The {{shifting}} mechanism was chosen {{with the additional}} input of Richard Ansdale. Space requirements, {{and the length of}} the gear cluster, meant that the selection mechanism would have to be mounted inside the gear cluster, rather than the usual motorcycle arrangement of dog clutches between the gears, an <b>external</b> <b>drum</b> to control their engagement and forks to connect the two. The mechanism needed to lock the selected gear onto the shaft, never engage more than one at a time, and all had to work at racing speeds.|$|E
50|$|Designed {{for live}} performance, it is small, {{lightweight}} but with full-sized keys and insanely huge set of sounds (2078 when fully expanded). Keyboard is truly semi-weighted, with metal weights glued under the keys, feels identical to D-50 and {{considered one of}} the best synth-action keybeds ever made. It has a powerful arpeggiator with multiple patterns that can be timed by external MIDI clock (like sequencer or drum machine), nine built-in drum kits (you'll need an <b>external</b> <b>drum</b> machine to use these). The XP-30 is aimed at expansion by giving the user 2 slots for adding Roland's own SR-JV80 range of expansion cards.|$|E
50|$|BRP Conrado Yap (listed as PG-840), BRP Cosme Acosta (PG-843), BRP Nicanor Jimenez (PG-846), and BRP Leon Tadina (PG-848) were {{reportedly}} decommissioned on 7 June 2001. Though decommissioned, these ships likely remain in storage either awaiting funds for refit {{or to be}} cannabalized for spare parts. Remaining ships were seen with variable armament (as with the Tomas Batillo class, also acquired from the Republic of Korea), and had been refitted with additional electronic equipment such as satellite communication gear and stowage for <b>external</b> fuel <b>drums</b> to extend the vessel's range.|$|R
50|$|On Tuesday 21 July 1992 {{a series}} of explosions leading to an intense fire broke out in a {{storeroom}} in a raw materials warehouse at Allied Colloids site in Low Moor, Bradford. The fire spread rapidly to {{the remainder of the}} warehouse and <b>external</b> chemical <b>drum</b> storage. Although none of the company employees were injured, 33 people, including three residents and 30 fire and/or police officers were taken to hospital where they were treated for smoke inhalation. Approximately 2000 local residents were confined to their houses and residents in eight properties immediately adjacent to the raw materials warehouse were evacuated.|$|R
5000|$|... 221 Challenger {{tanks were}} {{deployed}} to Saudi Arabia for Operation Granby, the UK {{operation in the}} Persian Gulf War. In the original deployment, the 7th Armoured Brigade included two armoured regiments, the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, both equipped with 57 of the latest Mark 3 version of the Challenger 1. They were modified for desert operations by a REME team and civilian contractors at the quayside in Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia. This fit included additional Chobham Armour along the hull sides and explosive reactive armour (ERA) on the nose and front glacis plate. Modifications also included the provision of extra <b>external</b> fuel <b>drums</b> and a smoke generator.|$|R
50|$|It {{supports}} MIDI, {{having a}} MIDI Out connector {{which allows the}} keyboard to control external MIDI equipment. It {{does not have a}} MIDI In connector. Although originally made for the consumer market, this keytar's MIDI out features are very powerful. Its drum rhythms and accompaniment are transmitted on separate MIDI channels, so that an <b>external</b> <b>drum</b> machine, sampler, or other MIDI equipment can be programmed to play the backing parts. Drums are transmitted on channel 16; Bass on 15; and three chord harmonies on channels 12-14. MIDI start/stop and tempo sync are also transmitted so an external sequencer may be utilized as well.|$|E
50|$|Gearless {{traction}} {{machines are}} low-speed (low-RPM), high-torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly {{attached to the}} end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 4000 ft/min m/s, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an <b>external</b> <b>drum</b> type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering). But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and redundancy (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and redundancy (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).|$|E

5000|$|The Third Reich Wehrmacht Heer's {{development}} division, the Heereswaffenamt (Army Ordnance Board), {{studied a}} number of gas turbine engine designs for use in tanks starting in mid-1944. The first gas turbine engine design intended for use in armoured fighting vehicle propulsion, the BMW 003-based GT 101, was meant for installation in the Panther tank.The second use of a gas turbine in an armoured fighting vehicle was in 1954 when a unit, PU2979, specifically developed for tanks by C. A. Parsons & Co., was installed and trialled in a British Conqueror tank. The Stridsvagn 103 {{was developed in the}} 1950s and was the first mass-produced main battle tank to use a turbine engine. Since then, gas turbine engines have been used as APUs in some tanks and as main powerplants in Soviet/Russian T-80s and U.S. M1 Abrams tanks, among others. They are lighter and smaller than diesels at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel, especially at idle, requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range. Successive models of M1 have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank's systems while stationary, saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine. T-80s can mount three large <b>external</b> fuel <b>drums</b> to extend their range. Russia has stopped production of the T-80 in favour of the diesel-powered T-90 (based on the T-72), while Ukraine has developed the diesel-powered T-80UD and T-84 with nearly the power of the gas-turbine tank. The French Leclerc MBT's diesel powerplant features the [...] "Hyperbar" [...] hybrid supercharging system,where the engine's turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger, enabling engine RPM-independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached (than with ordinary turbochargers). This system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank's powerplant and effectively removes turbo lag. This special gas turbine/turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary APU.|$|R
