25|$|Sir John Call {{argued the}} {{advantages}} of Norfolk Island {{in that it was}} uninhabited and that New Zealand <b>flax</b> <b>grew</b> there. In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by John Call, in its plan for colonisation of New South Wales. The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine II of Russia's decision to restrict sales of hemp. Practically all the hemp and flax required by the Royal Navy for cordage and sailcloth was imported from Russia.|$|R
50|$|Pale <b>flax</b> <b>grows</b> as a {{biennial}} or perennial {{plant in}} dry, sunny calcareous or neutral grasslands from sea level up to 1000 m. It has long, narrow stems to 60 cm tall and slender leaves 1.5-2.5 cm long. The flowers have five petals about 1 cm long and nearly round; they are pale blue but streaked with darker colour. It flowers {{in late spring}} and, at least in more temperate regions, through the summer. The flowers are monoecious and are pollinated by bees and wasps.|$|R

50|$|The {{area has}} been {{populated}} from circa the year 1000 CE. Agriculture and animal husbandry were {{the only means of}} existence for many centuries. All lands were owned by or in control of the nobility of Dordrecht. Not until the Eighty Years' War some industrial activities began to appear along the river dike. Furthermore, horticulture and <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> also developed.|$|E
50|$|The Phoenicians, who, {{with their}} {{merchant}} fleet, opened up new channels of commerce to {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean, and developed the tin mines of Cornwall, introduced <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> and the making of linen into Ireland before the common era. It is not until the twelfth century that we can find records of a definite attempt to systematize flax production.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th {{century the}} parish was noted for <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> {{and for the}} {{production}} of linen sailcloth and twine. These industries continuing until the end of World War II. A mill had first been recorded in the parish around 1285. The mill was a water/grist mill until the mid 18th, then becoming jointly used as a grain mill and for linen production.|$|E
25|$|Josephus {{interpreted}} the Tabernacle and its furnishings {{to represent the}} universe. He saw the Tabernacle's two parts accessible to the priests (the Holy and the Courtyard) to denote {{the land and the}} sea, the third division set aside for God (the Holy of Holies) to represent heaven, inaccessible to people. He saw the 12 loaves to denote the year divided into months. He saw the Menorah divided into 70 parts, representing the 70 divisions of the planets, and the seven lamps on the Menorah to refer to the course of the seven planets (then known). He saw the veils, composed of four things, to declare the four elements: the fine linen signified the earth, because the <b>flax</b> <b>grows</b> out of the earth; the purple signified the sea, because purple was dyed by the blood of shellfish from the sea; the blue signified the air; and the scarlet signified fire.|$|R
5000|$|The {{climate is}} cool temperate. Summers are drier {{than on the}} west coast of Britain, but cooler than southerly areas. Winters are cold at times, {{sometimes}} with snow. The soil is of a dark brown colour, free draining and gritty. It is very good for growing vegetables. Tender perennials are rare; some palms will grow, but need winter protection. Although Phormiums (New Zealand <b>flax)</b> <b>grow</b> in displays in Newbiggin, salt-laden winds may afford them some protection. The most exposed part of the town is to the east. High trees in Hirst Park give considerable shelter. The west part is much more sheltered, especially the wooded valley of the River Wansbeck. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is [...] "Cfb" [...] (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).|$|R
5000|$|Thus, by {{the early}} 19th century, the quality of rope {{materials}} made from New Zealand flax was known internationally, as was the quality of New Zealand trees which were used for spars and masts. The Royal Navy {{was one of the}} largest customers. The flax trade burgeoned, especially after male Māori recognised the advantages of trade and adapted to helping in the harvesting and dressing of flax which had previously been done exclusively by females. [...] "Whole tribes sometimes relocated to swamps where <b>flax</b> <b>grew</b> in abundance but where it was decidedly unhealthy to live. The taking of slaves increased - slaves who could be put to work dressing flax...". A burgeoning flax industry developed with the fibres being used for rope, twine, matting, carpet under felt, and wool packs. Initially wild stands of flax were harvested but plantations were established with three in existence by 1851.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the village}} {{consisted}} of linen weavers' cottages, {{to support the}} large <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> and linen weaving industry of Fife in the 17-1800s. These original cottages were usually of two rooms, one for the family to live in {{and one for the}} loom. There are also some original farm workers' cottages. These older cottages have been developed and extended but remain interesting and attractive.|$|E
50|$|Despite the plantation, Fanad {{retained}} its majority native population and Gaelic ways and Irish remained the principal spoken {{language of the}} peninsula - a situation that remained generally unchanged until the mid 19th century. The 18th century saw the introduction into Fanad of rural industry with a corresponding improvement in infrastructure. Rearing cattle commercially, herring fishing, <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> and linen production came to feature in the local economy from the mid-18th century.|$|E

2500|$|Josephus {{interpreted}} the linen vestment of [...] to signify the earth, as <b>flax</b> <b>grows</b> {{out of the}} earth. Josephus {{interpreted the}} Ephod of the four colors gold, blue, purple, and scarlet to signify that God made the universe of four elements, with the gold interwoven to show the splendor by which all things are enlightened. Josephus saw the stones on the High Priest's shoulders in [...] to represent {{the sun and the}} moon. He interpreted the breastplate of [...] to resemble the earth, having the middle place of the world, and the girdle that encompassed the High Priest to signify the ocean, which encircled the world. He interpreted the 12 stones of the Ephod in [...] to represent the months or the signs of the Zodiac. He interpreted the golden bells and pomegranates that [...] says hung on the fringes of the High Priest's garments to signify thunder and lightning, respectively.

He {{developed}} a model farm [...] "Burbrook", near Meadows, and was involved in sheep breeding, apple growing and experimented with commercial <b>flax</b> <b>growing.</b> He was involved with the Waite Research Institute in other field trials on his property. His was vitally interested in pastures, and experimented with various grasses and clovers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} {{density of the}} Pays de Caux is a little above the French average having developed fisheries, on the coast, and <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> and weaving, on the plateau, as traditional industries. The estuarine ports to the south developed trade up-river towards Rouen, once hostilities between the Normans and the French had been settled, with Paris. In more recent times, urbanization has spread from Le Havre and more recently still, from the new industrial polder in the Seine Estuary.|$|E
50|$|After the invasion, Moriori were {{forbidden}} to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. All became slaves of the Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutunga invaders. Many Moriori women had children by their Māori masters. A small number of Moriori women eventually married either Māori or European men. Some {{were taken from the}} Chathams and never returned. In 1842 a small party of Māori and their Moriori slaves migrated to the subantarctic Auckland Islands, surviving for some 20 years on sealing and <b>flax</b> <b>growing.</b> Only 101 Moriori out of a population of about 2,000 were left alive by 1862. Although the last Moriori of unmixed ancestry, Tommy Solomon, died in 1933, there are several thousand mixed ancestry Moriori alive today.|$|E
60|$|Eph {{took his}} fiddle and scraped away to his heart's {{content in the}} parlor, while the girls, after a short rest, set the table and made all ready to dish up the dinner when that {{exciting}} moment came. It {{was not at all}} the sort of table we see now, but would look very plain and countrified to us, with its green-handled knives and two-pronged steel forks; its red-and-white china, and pewter platters, scoured till they shone, with mugs and spoons to match, and a brown jug for the cider. The cloth was coarse, but white as snow, and the little maids had seen the blue-eyed <b>flax</b> <b>grow,</b> out of which their mother wove the linen they had watched and watered while it bleached in the green meadow. They had no napkins and little silver; but the best tankard and Ma's few wedding spoons were set forth in state. Nuts and apples at the corners gave an air, and the place of honor was left in the middle for the oranges yet to come.|$|R

50|$|In 1856 Törngren {{bought an}} area by lower rapids of Tammerkoski in Messukylä and got permissions for silk and linen manufacturing. As {{there was no}} {{industrial}} linen production in Finland, {{it is not known}} how Törngren got this business idea, but speculatively the initiator was Törngren's wife Sofia. Raw material was widely available, as <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> was common in Tavastia. However, the factory plan was postponed due to complaints. Törngren met his old friend Gustaf Wasastjerna, who had bought a nearby lot of an old ironworks at other side of the rapids in Tampere and planned to convert it into engineering works. The men decided to start business with joined forces, and Törngren applied for moving the location of his industrial rights {{to the other side of}} the river. A five-storey linen factory building was finished already in 1858 and taken into use in the following spring. Törngren's linen mill and Wasastjerna's engineering works were merged in 1861 as Tammerfors Linne- & Jern-Manufaktur Aktie-Bolag ("Tampere Linen and Iron Industry Ltd") but kept as separate business units. By the merger the men aimed to attract investors, but eventually they did not manage at gaining more capital because limited company concept was new in Finland, and Törngren and Wasastjerna finally owned 95% of the shares. The business developed favourably and in 1862 the linen mill was with its 755 workers the second biggest factory of Finland after the nearby Finlayson cotton mill.|$|E
40|$|As {{renewable}} {{raw material}} flax increasingly gain more importance as the range of its use is spreading more and more. Besides the conventional uses in home textiles, clothing and sails products, demand of flax raw materials for technical uses increases rapidly as flax fibers have high specific properties, become components of biodegradable composites, environmental friendly isolation materials, besides flax shives pay attention as well as components of environment friendly building materials. Unfortunately in Latvia during last decades flax crop production had decreased rapidly and nowadays reintroduction of <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> traditions and conditions are {{become more and more}} actual.

40|$|A {{new method}} of retting flax {{recently}} developed {{to suit the}} United Kingdom climate has allowed the reintroduction of <b>flax</b> <b>growing</b> to this country. The weed killer glyphosate is sprayed on the crop which then rets before harvesting six weeks later. The acute bronchoconstrictor responses of 11 normal subjects to dust from dew retted and from pre-harvest retted flaxes were compared in a double blind crossover fashion. There {{were no significant differences}} in the dust levels nor in the size of the dust particles in the experimental dust room. The decreases in pulmonary function after six hours of dust inhalation were significantly larger after pre-harvest retted flax dust than after dew retted flax dust (delta FEV 1, - 0. 21 and - 0. 40 1; delta MEF 50, - 0. 72 and - 1. 211 /s; delta sGaw (specific airway conductance), - 0. 17 and - 0. 65 kPa/s for dew retted and pre-harvest retted respectively). The subjects also reported more symptoms after inhaling pre-harvest retted flax dust. It is concluded that the acute bronchoconstrictor response to flax dust is increased by pre-harvest retting, suggesting an increased risk of byssinosis...|$|E
