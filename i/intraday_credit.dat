50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides <b>intraday</b> <b>credit.</b> This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully collateralised, i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for <b>intraday</b> <b>credit.</b> Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|E

The dual approach shows us how to make banks correctly internalize the intraday network externalities they create in the real-time gross settlement system and provides an objective standard for the daily microprudential surveillance of the payment system. ...|$|R

Moreover, the estimates show that the systematic dynamics in the intraday yield curves during the turmoil were highly noticeable, resulting in a significantly better goodness-of-fit.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, most central banks, {{concerned}} about settlement risks inherent in payment netting systems, have implemented real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. Although RTGS systems can significantly reduce settlement risk, they require greater liquidity to smooth nonsynchronized payment flows. Thus, central banks typically provide <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> to member banks, either as collateralized credit or priced credit. Because <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> is costly for banks, how intraday liquidity is managed has become a competitive parameter in commercial banking and a policy concern of central banks. This article uses a game-theoretical framework to analyze the intraday liquidity management behavior of banks in an RTGS setting. The games played by banks depend on the <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> policy of the central bank and encompass two well-known paradigms in game theory: "the prisoner's dilemma" and "the stag hunt. " The former strategy arises in a collateralized credit regime, where banks {{have an incentive to}} delay payments if <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> is expensive, an outcome that is socially inefficient. The latter strategy occurs in a priced credit regime, where postponement of payments can be socially efficient under certain circumstances. The author also discusses how several extensions of the framework affect the results, such as settlement risk, incomplete information, heterogeneity, and repeated play.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the literature on <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> in payment systems to date and explores the dilemma central banks face when deciding on their <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> policies. On the one hand, any strategy in which the costs of liquidity are not fully borne by payment system participants can be expected to yield an inefficient outcome. Participants would consume more credit than optimal and, due to moral hazard, central banks would be faced with larger amounts at risk and a greater risk of default than would otherwise be the case. On the other hand, a strategy making intraday liquidity expensive increases the risk of payment delays and payment system gridlocks, due to participants limiting their intraday borrowings and delaying the sending of payments, which can hamper the well functioning of the payment system. This could further influence the allocation of real resources, as achieving economic efficiency requires <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> to be provided without cost, even accounting for default risk and moral hazard. Recent developments in payment system design, which have improved the turnover ratio of reserves, have reduced the stringency of the dilemma in a number of countries. large-value payment system; intraday credit; liquidity. ...|$|E

40|$|One of the Federal Reserve's roles is {{to provide}} payment {{services}} to depository institutions and to the U. S. Treasury. Many of the nation's transfers of funds [...] whether they are large-dollar payments for financial market transactions or small-value business and consumer payments [...] settle through depository institutions' accounts held at the Federal Reserve for reserve-maintenance purposes and transaction processing. If a depository institution has insufficient balances during the day to cover its debits, it will run a negative balance or "daylight overdraft" in its Federal Reserve account until sufficient funds are received later in the day. Because depository institutions generally hold a relatively small amount of funds overnight in their Federal Reserve accounts {{in relation to the}} trillions of dollars of payments processed by the Federal Reserve each day, the Federal Reserve extends <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> to ensure the smooth functioning of the U.

The primer is composed of an introductory note and two separate papers. The first paper focuses on the clearance and settlement of GCF Repo. These financial plumbing details are especially important because the settlement of GCF Repo has been and will continue to be impacted by the current reforms to the tri-party repo settlement platform. In particular, the authors lay out the various ways that <b>intraday</b> <b>credit</b> was used pre-reform to facilitate the settlement of GCF Repo and why this use of credit is problematic.

The authors first describe the various strategies that dealers employ when trading GCF Repo and then use empirical analysis to quantify the predominance of these str ategies. Although they focus on different aspects of the GCF Repo Service, the two papers are complementary. This is because the strategies that dealers follow in trading GCF Repos are influenced by the clearance and settlement procedures in place. Furthermore, when gauging the risks of potential changes to the clearance and settlement of GCF Repo, it is important to take into account how GCF Repos are traded.

The authors simulate three deferred settlement mechanisms that complement RTGS systems: one-hour netting, six-hour netting, and a mechanism called a receipt-reactive gross settlement (RRGS) system. Their results suggest that in conjunction with RTGS systems, the RRGS mechanism could significantly reduce daylight credit extensions while modestly delaying the average time of payment settlement. Moreover, certain features of RRGS systems may encourage banks to submit payments earlier in the day.

In a numerical exercise, it is shown first, how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority a preference for a gross system, like Fedwire, over a net system, like EURO 1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.

It is shown that {{two types of}} outcome are possible - inefficient or efficient - depending on whether banks care about payments imbalances between {{them in the first}} period. If they do, banks delay payments to each other, increasing their aggregate liquidity requirements. It is argued that efficiency is not guaranteed even when banks face repeated interaction in a real payment system, largely because of imperfect information and the competitive dynamics of the payment industry. An efficient outcome can be achieved by the imposition of throughput rules on the value of payments banks must make by a certain deadline. These can both reduce aggregate liquidity requirements and increase the contestability of the payments market, encouraging a higher degree of direct access to payment systems. Throughput rules could therefore also have risk-reduction benefits if they help to reduce the level of tiering in the financial system. The detailed characteristics of these rules are shown to be important, and a number of design issues are addressed, such as how frequently requirements should be set, and whether throughput rules should apply on an aggregate or bilateral basis. ...|$|E

We thereby provide evidence that an implicit intraday money market exists. Second, we show that after the introduction of the foreign exchange settlement system CLS the value of intraday liquidity has increased during the hours of the CLS settlement cycle. Third, the turnover as well as the liquidity in SIC influence the intraday rate correspondingly. These facts provide evidence for the cost of immediacy. Features like RTGS, delivery-versus-payment and payment-versus-payment substitute credit risk with liquidity risk which in turn increases the value of intraday liquidity.

We show that in SSSs – contrary to payment systems – large and persistent settlement failures are possible even when ample liquidity is provided. Central bank liquidity support to SSSs thus cannot eliminate settlement failures due to major market disruptions. This {{is due to the fact}} that securities transactions involve a cash leg and a securities leg, and liquidity can affect only the cash side of a transaction. Whereas a broad program of securities borrowing and lending might help, it is precisely during periods of market disruption that participants will be least willing to lend securities. Interestingly, settlement failures continue to occur beyond the period corresponding to the lag in settlement. This is due to the fact that, upon observation of a default, market participants must form expectations about the impact of the default, and these expectations affect current trading behaviour. If, ex post, fewer of the previous trades settle than expected, new settlement failures will occur. This result has interesting implications for financial stability. On the one hand, conservative reactions by market participants to a default - for example by limiting the volume of trades – can result in a more rapid return of the settlement system to a normal level of efficiency. On the other hand, limitation of trading by market participants can reduce market liquidity, which may have a negative impact on financial stability. contagion; liquidity risk; securities clearing and settlement; systemic risk...|$|E
