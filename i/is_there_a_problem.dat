50|$|One of {{the central}} {{questions}} of complexity theory is whether randomness adds power; that is, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> which can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine but not a deterministic Turing machine? Or can deterministic Turing machines efficiently simulate all probabilistic Turing machines with at most a polynomial slowdown? It is currently widely believed by researchers that the latter is the case, which would imply P = BPP. The same question for log space instead of polynomial time (does L = BPLP?) is even more widely believed to be true. On the other hand, the power randomness gives to interactive proof systems, {{as well as the}} simple algorithms it creates for difficult problems such as polynomial-time primality testing and log-space graph connectedness testing, suggest that randomness may add power.|$|E
50|$|Several {{philosophers}} {{have argued}} that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As {{it appears that the}} defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.|$|E

40|$|Theory and Practice an the Competence of Graduate Nurse. Working in the Surgical Ambulance This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the contemporary situation and new trends in health service - in the branch of nursing. It presents and evaluates theoretical assumptions of further development of a graduated nurse in new conditions. The empirical part is aimed at identification of the conditions {{for the work of}} a graduated nurse and to recognize whether the current legislation enables such a nurse to work individually, concretely in surgical ambulance. The thesis concludes that graduated nurses are allowed to work individually and separately conformably to the laws, and patients and insurance companies take concern in their work.
