25|$|Patient {{history will}} often include pain or ache {{over the front}} and outer aspect of the {{shoulder}}, pain aggravated by leaning on the elbow and pushing upwards on the shoulder (such as leaning on the armrest of a reclining chair), intolerance of overhead activity, pain at night when lying directly on the affected shoulder, pain when reaching forward (e.g. unable to lift a gallon of milk <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator).</b> Weakness may be reported, but is often masked by pain and is usually found only through examination. With longer-standing pain, the shoulder is favored and gradually loss of motion and weakness may develop, which, due to pain and guarding, are often unrecognized by the patient and only brought to attention during examination.|$|E
500|$|Anita [...] "Needy" [...] Lesnicki, once an {{insecure}} and bookish teenager {{living near}} Devil's Kettle, [...] Minnesota, {{is now a}} violent mental inmate who narrates the story as a flashback while in solitary confinement. Since childhood, she had been friends with a selfish and popular cheerleader, Jennifer Check, despite having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by indie rock band Low Shoulder. A suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. In shock, Jennifer agrees to leave with the band despite Needy's protests. Later that evening, Jennifer, covered in blood, appears in Needy's kitchen and proceeds to eat food <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> Unable to digest it, she vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid and then leaves in a hurry as Needy calls after her.|$|E

500|$|The {{next few}} loops feature a {{refrigerator}} {{hanging from the}} ceiling, leaking blood, the muffled sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> and it violently shakes and moves, implying that the baby is trapped inside. This happens several times, each time being more severe than the last. As it transitions, the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, and the character moves abnormally quickly, {{with a set of}} disturbing illusions. Eventually, the protagonist listens to a murder being committed in the bathroom through the bathroom peephole. After the audio ends, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature addressing the protagonist that ten months earlier, he lost his job and turned to alcoholism. His wife then landed a part-time cashier job in order to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her, implying a motive for the familicide. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering [...] "204863" [...] repeatedly and the player's perspective distorts, before the game displays a false crash message.|$|E
500|$|When Lester {{is caught}} masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about {{their lack of}} {{intimacy}} {{is the first time}} he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's [...] "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to [...] "regain a voice in a home that [...] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when [...] Angela and he almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and [...] "wraps her up". Mendes called it [...] "the most satisfying end to [...] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a [...] "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks [...] "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is [...] "the culmination of the theme" [...] of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.|$|E

50|$|The {{cooling cycle}} starts with liquid ammonia {{entering}} the evaporator at room temperature. The {{volume of the}} evaporator {{is greater than the}} volume of the liquid, with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen lowers the partial pressure of the ammonia gas, thus lowering the boiling point of the liquid below the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator's</b> interior. Ammonia evaporates, taking a small amount of heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> liquid and lowering the liquid's temperature, until it reaches that boiling point. It then continues to evaporate, without the liquid descending below the boiling point, while the large enthalpy of vaporization (heat) flows <b>from</b> <b>the</b> warmer <b>refrigerator</b> interior to <b>the</b> cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas.|$|R

40|$|A dual {{refrigeration}} system for cooling a sink device is described, which automatically thermally couples <b>the</b> cold <b>refrigerator</b> to <b>the</b> sink device while thermally isolating <b>the</b> warm <b>refrigerator</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sink device.

2500|$|Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes are {{typically}} named after an event, object, or person that figures {{prominently in the}} plot, similarly to how Seinfeld episodes were named. Many episodes concern breaches of intricate aspects of social conventions, such as the various details of tipping at restaurants, the obligation to [...] "stop and chat" [...] upon meeting an acquaintance, the allowed amount of caviar one may put on a cracker at a house party, and whether a house guest needs {{the permission of the}} homeowner before taking a soft drink <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> Others involve more significant issues, such as if and when a white person may say the racially sensitive word [...] "nigger". And some involve the etiquette of extremely complex and unique circumstances, such as the occasion when Larry discovered at a wake that the deceased was to be buried with his favorite golf club—borrowed from Larry. Another involved Larry picking up a prostitute {{for the sole purpose of}} using the carpool lane on the freeway.
