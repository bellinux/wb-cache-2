5|$|Early European explorers in North America, {{who were}} {{familiar}} with the smaller red deer of Europe, thought that the larger North American animal resembled a moose, and consequently gave it the name elk, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> European name for moose. The word elk is related to the Latin alces, Old Norse elgr, Scandinavian elg/älg and German Elch, all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the moose.|$|E

5|$|Haystacks <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> English {{title for}} a series of impressionist {{paintings}} by Claude Monet. The principle subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266-1290) which Monet began {{near the end of the}} summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.|$|E

Proposals have been heard from since the 1960s, including highways connecting from I-5 {{all the way to}} the Canada–US border, and some just between I-5 and I-90. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has no projects designated I-605 at this time. However, a project to convert State Route 18 (SR18) to a limited-access freeway is under construction currently.|$|E

Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in the traditional sense, but has been called that since the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> {{name for}} Pteroclididae, {{a family of}} sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pteroclidiformes. They are {{traditionally}} placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and India through to central Asia. The ranges of the black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas's sandgrouse occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.|$|E

40|$|The {{types and}} the {{incidence}} of the mechanism, the immediate and underlying causes of death were studied in 503 consecutive autopsy cases. The mechanisms of death were classified as respiratory failure (223 cases), combined organ failure (122 cases), circulatory failure (89 cases), hepatic failure (31 cases), central nervous failure (24 cases), renal failure (6 cases) and unknown (8 cases). To interpret the mechanism of death, <b>the</b> autopsy findings <b>were</b> satisfactory in {{approximately half of the}} cases, thuogh additional functional estimation <b>was</b> necessary in <b>the</b> remaining cases. In cases of respiratory failure, pneumonia and pulmonary involvement of carcinomas <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> immediate causes of death, and lung cancer <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most <b>common</b> underlying cause of death. In cases of combined organ failure, spreading of carcinomas in various organs <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most <b>common</b> immediate cause of death, and carcinomas of stomach, lung and pancreas <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> underlying causes of death. The cases of circulatory failure were further divided into heart failure and peripheral circulatory failure. Myocardial infarction <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most commn cause of death, immediate as well as underlying, in heart failure. In peripheral circuratory failure, hemorrhage and sepsis <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> immediate causes of death, and carcinomas of the liver and stomach <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> underlying causes of death in peripheral circuratory failure.
