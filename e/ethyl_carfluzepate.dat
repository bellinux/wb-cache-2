50|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>carfluzepate</b> {{is mainly}} a {{hypnotic}} drug {{which is a}} benzodiazepine derivative and induces sleep in a strong manner. It is similar to ethyl loflazepate in chemical structure, the other difference being an absence of methylcarbamoyl group. Its also similar in metabolism to this substance, only the methyl-carboxylate group would {{be the difference between}} the main metabolites. Two of the main metabolites must be the 3-hydroxylate or the substance with only a hydrogen atom at the 3-position of the molecule structure. In order to that the resulting main metabolite could probably be ethyl-7-cloro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methylcarbamate)-2-oxo-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-hydroxylate (and the 3-OH instead of the 3H metabolite). Its properties are mainly sedative and hypnotic.|$|E
