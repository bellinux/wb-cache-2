2500|$|... “I fear earnestly that Mistress Boulstred {{will not}} escape that {{sickness}} {{in which she}} labors at this time. I sent this morning to ask of her passage of this night; and the return is, that she is as <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> yesternight... fear that she will scare last so long as that you, when you receive this letter, may do her any good office in praying for her.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> {{pale and}} sad, with my letter in her hand. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> with my mind in a tumult of contending emotions, which {{gradually}} resolved themselves into two master-feelings as I walked on: Love, that adored her more fervently than ever; and Hope, {{that set the}} prospect before me of seeing her again on the next day.|$|E
60|$|Har. Jun. 'Twas hereabout <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> tied. The rage of love renews again within me.|$|E
60|$|To-night <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>her</b> alone. They {{would have}} it <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>her</b> for ever.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>left</b> them <b>her</b> cousin {{gave me a}} great {{flourish}} {{with his}} picturesque hat.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{business}} in London," [...] <b>I</b> answered--and <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> before her curiosity could madden me (in the state I was in at that moment) with more questions.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> {{and in my}} rage {{slammed the}} door, so that the lock {{shattered}} behind me.|$|E
60|$|Isaac. You! O Lud no! how {{the devil}} should you? 'Twas Antonio she wanted; and with Antonio <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Darling Alfred'--'dearest Alfred'--'wicked calumnies' --'wicked lies'--'wicked woman'--to accuse her 'dear husband'! The sooner <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> {{house the}} better. So I'm off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's you, Mr. Paret," [...] she said, {{as though}} I {{had been a}} {{frequent}} caller. I had never once darkened her threshold since <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>her</b> house.|$|R
60|$|Bessie now endeavoured {{to persuade}} her to take a {{sedative}} draught: she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. <b>I</b> then <b>left</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Entirely," [...] said Flora. [...] "No {{one could}} look at her without seeing that she liked him. <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>her</b> {{to be the only}} {{effective}} one at home, and she sacrificed herself." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> and {{set forth}} {{to pave the}} way for discovery--the dark and {{doubtful}} way, which began at the lawyer's door.|$|E
60|$|And thus <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> nor did I again set my eyes {{upon her}} till nine long years {{had come and}} gone.|$|E
6000|$|Calib. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> clambering up {{a hollow}} oak, and {{plucking}} thence the dropping honey-combs.--Say, my king, shall I call her to thee? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your mother's," [...] he answered. [...] "I built {{them the}} year I {{came back from}} America and gave them to her. I thought it would {{interest}} her. Perhaps it would, if <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>her</b> to her own ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{returned}} to Philippa, where <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>her</b> in the four-wheeler. We drove off, and found ourselves before a double-swinging (ay, ominous as it seemed, swinging) plain oak door, over which in old English letters was written-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm a {{going to}} seek her, fur and wide. If any hurt {{should come to}} me, {{remember}} that the last words <b>I</b> <b>left</b> for <b>her</b> was, [...] "My unchanged love is with my darling child, and I forgive her!"' ...|$|R
60|$|For myself, I shared, too, Tobain's nameless apprehensions. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> {{and knocked}} softly at the door. There was no answer. So I entered.|$|E
60|$|I {{think there}} were tears in her eyes when <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> but I could not see clearly, for mine also had {{suddenly}} grown dim.|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> {{somewhat}} comforted, {{knowing how}} sound was her judgment, {{and went off}} to make my preparations for the expedition to Sikonyela's country.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} they won't," [...] I {{answered}} with a nervous laugh; [...] "at any rate, until I have won back my mare." [...] (<b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>her</b> in Retief's care as stakeholder, until the match should be shot off.) ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{then came}} the interpretation. [...] "She has done it because <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> might have told it from her letters. She has done it because she thinks I am not in earnest, that my love-making was just boyishness ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{confidence}} roused my {{most vivid}} curiosity. When she <b>left</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> with <b>her.</b> The Le Geyts {{lived in one}} of those new streets of large houses on Campden Hill, so that our way eastward lay naturally through Kensington Gardens.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{would explain}} nothing to me, {{she insisted on}} seeing your lordship; and--in fact--she {{was in such a}} state of {{agitation}} that <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> with Mrs. Bowles.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do I {{know whether}} she is at home or not. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> there. Very likely she is with her Aunt Marian, telling stories about her mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do be a pet and go {{and talk}} to Jane Hubbard. I'm sure she must be feeling lonely. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> all by herself down on the next deck." ...|$|E
50|$|During World War <b>I,</b> Mrs. McQueen <b>left</b> <b>her</b> {{home and}} served in war relief work in Palestine under Field Marshal Allenby.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you will}} not commit yourself. Well, I like discretion. I have always seen it from the first. No one has worked for you as I have. I like true love, and <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>her</b> all my china in my will.' ...|$|R
60|$|With a last, {{reluctant}} embrace <b>I</b> finally <b>left</b> <b>her,</b> walked blindly {{to where}} the motor car was standing, and started the engine. I looked back. Outlined {{in the light of}} the doorway I saw her figure in what seemed an attitude of supplication....|$|R
60|$|Rho. No? Why, suppose I had a {{delicate}} screwed gun; if <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> clean, {{and found her}} foul, I should discover, to my cost, she had been shot in.|$|E
60|$|Duke to Fred. 'Tis a mistake, the {{ambassador}} knows nothing of her: I'm resolved I'll know it of herself, ere she shall depart.--Ha! Where is she? <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> here.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>her</b> {{getting ready}} to go out shopping. She wants to get a pin like the one Nanny Corey had on." [...] "O my Lord!" [...] groaned Lapham.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have done}} it," [...] Dominey acknowledged. [...] "She has {{gone off to}} bed now, and she is leaving early to-morrow morning. She thinks I have {{borrowed}} some West African magic, that <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>her</b> lover's soul out there and come home in his body." ...|$|R
60|$|Thereafter I bade them farewell, nor am I {{disposed}} to write concerning what passed at the parting of Elliot and me. For thrice ere now <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>her</b> to {{pass into the}} mouth of war, but now I went into other peril, and with fainter hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "'No, you old iniquity,' <b>I</b> answered; 'I <b>left</b> <b>her</b> {{in the top}} of a thorn-tree, {{screaming}} like {{a thousand}} bluejays. The elephant put her there.' ...|$|R
