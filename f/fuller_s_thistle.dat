40|$|The {{importance}} of disturbance in prairie {{has long been}} recognized. Increasingly interest and research {{have focused on the}} action and interaction of multiple disturbances. The distribution of Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> [Cirsium flodmanii (Rydb.) Arthur] on ant mounds, badger mounds, buffalo wallows, and potholes and in a lightly and a moderately grazed pasture was compared at the Nature Conservancy 2 ̆ 7 s S. H. Ordway Jr. Memorial Prairie in northcentral South Dakota. In the lightly grazed pasture, Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> occurred most frequently on hilltops and ridges, but in the moderately grazed pasture it occurred with equal frequency on hilltops and ridges, and low areas surrounding potholes. Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> was common on earthen mammal mounds and was less abundant on thatching ant mounds and buffalo wallows. No thistles were sampled in potholes. Relative availability of light may explain the thistle 2 ̆ 7 s distribution. Implications of observed patterns are discussed for the evolution of life history traits and the management of prairie remnants...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{recovery}} {{planning for}} a rare species relies upon knowledge of its life history and ecology, {{as well as an}} understanding of its habitat requirements and disturbance regime (Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Soule 1986, Lande 1988 a). Species that depend upon early-successional or transient habitats in landscape mosaics present unique recovery challenges (Menges 1990). They require perpetuation of multiple populations within a shifting mosaic of local habitats. Recovery plans for these species must be formulated from an understanding of population demography within the context of community and landscape dynamics. Processes that maintain landscape mosaics must be given long-term protection if recovery is to succeed. Pitcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle,</b> Cirsium pitcher (Torr.) T. and G., is listed as threatened in the United States and Canada (Harrison 1988). This monocarpic plant is endemic to the western Great Lakes sand dunes. It is an early-successional species that colonizes open patches in dynamic dune landscapes (Pavlovic et al. 1993). Its recovery depends upon the perpetuation of interacting mosaics of populations, or metapopulations, in Great Lakes dune systems. The concept of metapopulation dynamics (Levins 1970, den Boer 1981, Gilpin 1987, Goodman 1987 a, Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Hanski 1991) is useful for understanding Cirsium pitcheri ecology and management options. It describes species persistence in environments where the probability of local extinction is high, and has applications to species recovery and reserve design (e. g., Shaffer 1981, Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Soule 1986, Goodman 1987 b, Lande 1988 b, Menges 1990, Murphy, Freas 2 ̆ 6 Weiss 1990). In this chapter, we present a recovery model for Pitcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> based upon metapopulation theory and apply it to recovery sites in Illinois and Indiana...|$|R
30|$|Contemporary {{co-ordinate}} numbering of the HBV genome assigns {{a position}} of 1 to the first “T” nucleotide after the EcoR 1 restriction site (G|AA T TC) when sequenced in the forward direction. Prior to this convention, {{the start of the}} Core region (position 1901 in the contemporary system) was considered to be the first position of the HBV genome. The HBV genome is circular and position 1 happens to occur within the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> (surface) ORF. Therefore, the full nucleotide sequence of the S gene straddles position 1, and the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> ORF does not run contiguously within a linear sequence in the standard orientation. Thus, the start of the S ORF varies depending on the genotype, being 2854 for genotype A, 2848 for genotypes B to F and H, and 2884 for genotype G. In all genotypes, the S ORF ends at position 835.
