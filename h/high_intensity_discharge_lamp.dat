One factor is that there is a lack of a heat {{transfer}} model which can accurately predict facade performance. A model of performance has been developed by Daniel Arons. The goal of the work presented is to verify the model with experimentation on a small-scale facade. Sunlight was simulated with a 400 W metal halide <b>High</b> <b>Intensity</b> <b>Discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> Outdoor summer conditions were simulated with a residential space heater. Two 1 / 8 " thick panes of uncoated window glass, separated by 7 ", with 1 " white aluminum blinds in the center, made up the facade structure. Air was driven through the channel at velocities up to 0. 7 mis. The results of experimentation validate the model when no light is being projected on the facade. More work needs to be done to refine the model for cases where there is little or no airflow and also when light is shining on the facade. More specifically, the interaction between incident radiation and blinds should be refined.

40|$|Electroluminescence {{in solid}} {{materials}} {{is defined as}} the generation of light by the passage of an electric current through a body of solid material under an applied electric field. A specific type of electroluminescence, first noted in 1923, involves the generation of photons when electrons are passed through a p-n junction of certain solid materials (junction of a n-type semiconductor, an electron donor, and a p-type semiconductor, an electron acceptor). The development of this light emitting semiconductor technology dates back less than 30 years. During this period of time, the LED has evolved from a rare and expensive light generating device {{to one of the most}} widely used electronic components. A number of LED characteristics are of considerable importance in selecting a light source for plant lighting in a controlled environment facility. Of particular importance is the characteristic that light is generated by an LED at a rate far greater than the corresponding thermal radiation predicted by the bulk temperature of the device as defined by Plank's radiation law. This is in sharp contrast to other light sources, such as an incandescent or <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> A plant lighting system for controlled environments must provide plants with an adequate flux of photosynthetically active radiation, plus providing photons in the spectral regions that are involved in the photomorphogenic and phototropic responses that result in normal plant growth and development. Use of light sources that emit photons over a broad spectral range generally meet these two lighting requirements. Since the LED's emit over specific spectral regions, they must be carefully selected so that the levels of photsynthetically active and photomorphogenic and phototropic radiation meet these plant requirements...|$|E
