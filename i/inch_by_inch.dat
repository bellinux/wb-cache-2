25|$|In my judgment, U.S. {{involvement}} in Zaire defies justification. It {{is true that}} the U.S. has not utilized the full measure of resources available for Zaire, nor responded to Mobutu's requests for arms and ammunition. This restraint by the Administration is commendable, but if Mobutu qualifies for neither arms nor ammunition, then he should not qualify for any form of military assistance, lest the United States be drawn into the hapless conflict in Zaire, <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E

25|$|Whether in {{the main}} sweep or in an {{individual}} stop's sweep, the same tactics would be applied. The sweepline would proceed forward with each soldier scanning line of sight ahead through the bush and undergrowth. The speed of this movement varied depending on the terrain and density of the bush, but when the troops sensed enemy ahead the sweep slowed markedly, edging forward <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch,</b> rifles at ready and pointed ahead with the safety catches off.

25|$|O'Bannon briefly {{trained for}} {{war in the}} Caribbean and sailed from Boston on 29August 1942 for the Southwest Pacific, where the long and arduous Guadalcanal {{campaign}} had just begun. For over a year, the Navy—stretched thin to cover its worldwide commitments at a period when new ships {{were just beginning to}} join the fleet in any number—was to fight and fight again in the Solomon Islands {{in one of the most}} bitterly contested campaigns of history, wresting air and sea control from the Japanese and providing the Marine Corps and the Army with every possible support as they gained ground <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch</b> on the myriad islands.

500|$|The race {{started on}} Saturday 24 March 1877 at 8:27 a.m. [...] Oxford {{had won the}} toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. The Dark Blues took an early lead and were ahead at the Mile Post, but by the Crab Tree pub, the crews were level. [...] Cambridge pulled ahead and held a quarter-of-a-length lead by Hammersmith Bridge which they {{extended}} until the crews arrived at Chiswick Reach where Oxford re-took the lead. [...] At Chiswick Steps the Dark Blues were leading by half-a-length, and by Barnes Bridge they were clear. [...] Experiencing strong head winds and rough water, Cowles, the Oxford bow man, suffered serious damage to his oar, nullifying further contribution to the race. [...] Described by an Oxford undergraduate watching the race: [...] "suddenly Oxford staggered and stood still in a mass of foam: the bow-oar, Cowles, had struck the top of a big wave in feathering and broken his blade clean off." [...] Almost immediately, Cambridge took the advantage, but were held off by a determined Oxford crew who [...] "spurted magnificently and drew up steadily <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch,</b> so that it was a near thing as they passed the post".|$|E

2500|$|Every man {{sprang to}} duty. The cheerful chanty was roared out, and heard above the howl of the gale. The cable held very hard, {{and when it}} surged over, the {{windlass}} sent the men flying about the deck, as if a galvanic battery had been applied to their hands. The vessel's head was often buried in the solid seas, and the men, soaked and sweating, yelled out hoarsely, [...] "Paddy on the Railway," [...] and [...] "We're Homeward Bound," [...] while they tugged at the brakes, and wound the long, hard cable in, <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Wolverines {{drove the}} ball to Northwestern's five-yard-line on four drives but failed to score a touchdown, having one drive halted by a holding penalty and three others stopped on downs.

[...] Then the fierce battering would begin again, Michigan would hurl its weight of muscle and sinew against the crumbling line of purple, and <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch</b> the ball would travel back toward the final line; again the chant of victory would rise from the Wolverines only to die away in disappointment, while wild yells poured down under the fluttering ribbons of the Evanston supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maroto himself relates in the [...] "Manifiesto razonado de las causas del convenio de Vergara" [...] ("Reasoned {{manifesto}} of {{the causes}} of the Convention of Vergara") how and why he joined the Carlist cause. Since his social and professional position—as well as his future prospects—were of great fortune, he insists that he did not join to get rich or to prosper. He asserts that he decided to follow the pretender to the crown, the Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, brother of king Ferdinand VII's and uncle to the future queen Isabella II because he thought it was the best for Spain, thinking that the possible rule of Don Carlos was better than that of a 3-year-old girl, whose minority would bring forward an unclear regency. Maroto at the time had more faith in Don Carlos, in whom he saw qualities of religious principles, an orderly and economic system at his own home, and an observance of the law. He also confesses that by following an exiled prince, he was almost certain of failure and that the few victories they might achieve would be bleak, <b>inch</b> <b>by</b> <b>inch,</b> without large, spectacular advances, and that in addition they would not be treated as authentic soldiers but as bandits and traitors.|$|E
