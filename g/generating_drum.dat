40|$|Drum brake squeal is {{a common}} discomfort. The main goal of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the mechanisms that generate drum brake squeal {{and to create a}} base for the search for solutions. A series of steps towards the understanding of these mechanisms are taken. Firstly, a simple model for friction-induced vibration is presented. The solutions to this model might be unstable in spite of a constant coefficient of friction. The essential thing observed is that a coupling between different modes is necessary to form instabilities. The coupling is shown to be between two translational degrees of freedom. Secondly, the mathematical model for friction-induced vibration is refined to take the flexibility of the drum, shoes and linings into account. This model is used to study the mechanisms that couple modes. The analysis shows that there are four mechanisms present in <b>generating</b> <b>drum</b> brake squeal. These mechanisms all occur owing to lining deformations, and the instability type is given the name "Lining Deformation Induced Instabilities". The mechanisms create waves that move in different directions. In a squealing brake, all the waves are superposed, which leads the solution towards a standing wave. A standing wave or synchronous vibration is always stable, and if a pure synchronous vibration is created, the noise would be eliminated at the source. The experimental partt of the investigation concerns the measurement of the vibration of a drum brake. The deflection shape is measured in operation, i. e. while the vehicle is running on a test ground. The deflection shape covers radial vibrations of the drum as well as radial and tangential vibrations of the leading shoe. The accelerometers are distributed both axially and tangentially on both the shoe and the drum. Finally, a finite element model for friction-induced vibration and noise generation is used to study the influence of different self-excitations on drum brake squeal. The model is semi-three-dimensional, with a two-dimensional drum and three-dimensional shoes. A contact element is derived that takes the friction variation into account as well as follower forces and negative. my. -velocity slope. For the brake analyzed, the results are: "Stick-Slip" is impossible for vehicle speeds over 0. 04 km/h. The destabilizing effect of the "Negative. my. -Velocity Slope" is less than the stabilizing effect of the material damping of the parts. "Self-Locking" is shown to be impossible. The "Lining Deformation Induced Instability" type results in great squeal propensity. The instabilities from "Follower Forces" are negligible. The rotation of the drum gives frequency shifts that stabilize the brake. The frequencies and mode shapes generated from the model with the lining deformation induced instability type show very good agreement with the measured ones. With the knowledge of the mechanisms behind and characteristics of drum brake squeal, a set of solution classes is outlined. A series of examples is given to show the usefulness of such classes as an aid in the creative process of generating solution principles...|$|E

40|$|Automobile brakes {{have been}} intensively {{developed}} during past few decades, but the maximum motor’s power, that should amortized in vehicle brakes, has been significantly increased also. Most of the kinetic {{energy of the}} moving vehicles is transforming into heat through friction. But the small part of kinetic energy transforms into sound pressure and makes noise. Low frequency squeal of drum brakes is very intense {{and can lead to}} customers’ complain. The interaction between the brake system and the vehicle framework and suspension is often very substantial during occurrence of brake noise. Unfortunately, to solve this type of squeal problem is also difficult because of the large number of components involved. The other cause is attributed to self-excited vibration that is induced when the friction material has a negative slope in relation to the relative velocity. This paper illustrates an approach to experimental studies of drum brakes in road conditions in order to monitor changes in the coefficient of friction that can <b>generate</b> <b>drum</b> brake squeal at low frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Audio {{quality is}} known to cross-modally {{influence}} reaction speed, sense of presence, and visual quality. We designed an experiment to test the effect of audio quality on source localisation. Stimuli with different MP 3 compression rates, {{as a proxy for}} audio quality, were <b>generated</b> from <b>drum</b> samples. Participants (n = 18) estimated the position of a snare drum target while compression rate, masker, and target position were systematically manipulated in a full-factorial repeated-measures experiment design. Analysis of variance revealed that location accuracy was better in wide target positions than in narrow, with a medium effect size; and that the effect of target position was moderated by compression rate in different directions for wide and narrow targets. The results suggest that there might be two perceptual effects at play: one, whereby increased audio quality causes a widening of the soundstage, possibly via a SMARC-like mechanism, and two, whereby it enables higher localisation accuracy. In the narrow target positions in this experiment, the two effects acted in opposite directions and largely cancelled each other out. In the wide target presentations, their effects were compounded and led to significant correlations between compression rate and localisation error. QC 20151117 </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{glove box}} {{vitrification}} system is being fabricated to process aqueous evaporator bottom waste generated at the Plutonium Facility (TA- 55) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The {{system will be}} the first within the U. S. Department of Energy Complex to routinely convert Pu{sup 239 }-bearing transuranic (TRU) waste to a glass matrix for eventual disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Currently at LANL, this waste is solidified in Portland cement. Radionuclide loading in the cementation process is restricted by potential radiolytic degradation (expressed as a wattage limit), which has been imposed to prevent the accumulation of flammable concentrations of H{sub 2 } within waste packages. Waste matrixes with a higher water content (e. g., cement) are assigned a lower permissible wattage limit to compensate for their potential higher generation of H{sub 2 }. This significantly increases the number of waste packages that must be prepared and shipped, thus driving up the costs of waste handling and disposal. The glove box vitrification system that is under construction will address this limitation. Because the resultant glass matrix produced by the vitrification process is non-hydrogenous, no H{sub 2 } can be radiolytically evolved, and drums could be loaded to the maximum allowable limit of 40 watts. In effect, the glass waste form shifts the limiting constraint for loading disposal drums from wattage to the criticality limit of 200 fissile gram equivalents, thus significantly reducing the number of <b>drums</b> <b>generated</b> from this waste stream. It is anticipated that the number of <b>drums</b> <b>generated</b> from treatment of evaporator bottoms will be reduced by a factor of 4 annually when the vitrification system is operational. The system is currently undergoing non-radioactive operability testing, and will be fully operational in the year 2003...|$|R

40|$|Development of the gamma-ray spectrometric {{technique}} termed GSAK (Gamma-Ray Spectrometry with Acceptable Knowledge) for {{the characterization}} of CC 104 / 107 remote-handled transuranic (RH-TRU) wastes continued this year. Proof-of-principle measurements have been completed on the surrogate RH-TRU waste drums configured earlier this year. The GSAK technique uses conventional gamma-ray spectrometry to quantify the detectable fission product content of overpacked RH-TRU drums. These results are then coupled with the inventory report to characterize the waste drum content. The inventory report is based on process knowledge of the waste drum loading and calculations of the isotopic distribution in the spent fuel examined to <b>generate</b> the <b>drummed</b> wastes. Three RH-TRU surrogate drums were configured with encapsulated EBR-II driver fuel rod segments arranged in the surrogate drum assemblies. Segment-specific inventory calculations initially specified the radionuclide content of the fuel segments and thus the surrogate drums. Radiochemical assays performed on representative fuel element segments identified {{a problem in the}} accuracy of some of the fission and activation product inventory values and provided a basis for adjustment of the specified surrogate drum inventories.

A new version of Bol Processor, BP 2, has been implemented in a MIDI studio environment to serve as a aid to rule-based composition in contemporary music.

To represent a triangular impulse exactly an infinite number of modes is needed; if a finite number of modes is used, the representation will be somewhat blurry. In Triangular Vibrations three superimposed drums are used, coloured respectively red, green and blue. Nine hundred modes are used for each drum.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NYC disco DJ Larry Levan, {{known for his}} {{electric}} mixes, gained a cult following, and the Paradise Garage, the nightclub at which he spun, became the prototype for the modern dance club where {{the music and the}} DJ were showcased. Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called house music emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the Warehouse Club in Chicago, where resident DJ Frankie Knuckles mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat <b>generated</b> by a <b>drum</b> machine or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth bassline. In 1983, Jesse Saunders released what some consider the first house music track, [...] "On & On."

500|$|The rhythmic {{direction}} of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated whirring and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance, [...] "whether we were in space, or underwater {{or a group of}} Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo bells, and several other hand percussion instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. [...] "I would hit them just like they do at [...] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to <b>generate</b> from his <b>drum</b> machine, as during the [...] "Ife" [...] segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him [...] "see {{what you can do with}} it." [...] Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, creating a sound he said was [...] "total tapestry".|$|R
40|$|During routine {{inspections}} in March 1996, transuranic (TRU) {{waste drums}} stored at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) were found with pinholes and leaking fluid. These drums were overpacked, and further inspection discovered over 200 drums with similar corrosion. A task team {{was assigned to}} investigate the problem with four specific objectives: to identify any other drums in RWMC TRU storage with pinhole corrosion; to evaluate {{the adequacy of the}} RWMC inspection process; to determine the precise mechanism(s) <b>generating</b> the pinhole <b>drum</b> corrosion; and to assess the implications of this event for WIPP certifiability of waste drums. The task team investigations analyzed the source of the pinholes to be Hcl-induced localized pitting corrosion. Hcl formation {{is directly related to the}} polychlorinated hydrocarbon volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the waste. Most of the drums showing pinhole corrosion are from Content Code- 003 (CC- 003) because they contain the highest amounts of polychlorinated VOCs as determined by headspace gas analysis. CC- 001 drums represent the only other content code with a significant number of pinhole corrosion drums because their headspace gas VOC content, although significantly less than CC- 003, is far greater than that of the other content codes. The exact mechanisms of Hcl formation could not be determined, but radiolytic and reductive dechlorination and direct reduction of halocarbons were analyzed as the likely operable reactions. The team considered the entire range of feasible options, ranked and prioritized the alternatives, and recommended the optimal solution that maximizes protection of worker and public safety while minimizing impacts on RWMC and TRU program operations...|$|R
5000|$|Cumbia {{style has}} {{its origins in}} the {{caribbean}} climates of Colombia, Venezuela and Panama, and was introduced to Chile in the mid 1960s by the Venezuelan Luisín Landáez. [...] Later in the same decade, Colombian musician Amparito Jiménez would record and release albums in Chile and had great success with the song “La pollera colora”, {{one of the most}} emblematic Colombian songs. Later, the Chilean band Sonora Palacios would bring cumbia to mass popularity among the Chilean population. Since the beginning, Chile has developed its own kind of cumbia known as [...] "cumbia sonora" [...] or just [...] "traditional Chilean cumbia", with long standing orchestras such as Orquesta Huambaly, La Sonora de Tommy Rey, Sonora Palacios, Los Vikings 5, Giolito y su combo and Pachuco y la Cubanacán. These have been {{some of the most popular}} acts in the last 50 years and still enjoy mainstream popularity, seen as part of Chile’s musical culture and identity. Chilean cumbia added brass instruments, piano and a faster percussion to the original cumbia style. The process of adaptation and evolution created a sub style that can be easily identified from the original. Chilean cumbia bands are called “Combos”, “Sonoras” or simply “Orquestas” (orchestras) and are formed by 10 or more musicians where the brass and the drums have an important role. Cumbia developed this orchestral performance style in the 1960s, adapting from the tropical orchestras that had played rhythms such as the cha-cha-cha, mambo, rumba, bolero, and merengue in the 1920-1940s. Some subgenres that were not originally from Chile also became popular in the country: In the 1990s, cumbia sound, known in other countries of Latin America as Technocumbia, is a style of dumbia where there is a fusion between electronic sounds <b>generated</b> by electronic <b>drums,</b> and electric guitar. [...] "Technocumbia" [...] was a name given to the subgenre in Mexico to describe this type of music. However, the style was developed throughout South America with different names: “Sound” in Chile and “Cumbia Villera” in Argentina. In the 2000s, Cumbia romántica emerged, a style where great emphasis was placed on the (usually romantic) lyrics and where the artists can be a solo male or female singer rather than a band. Unlike Technocumbia, cumbia romantica arrangements tend to be acoustic. Some performers in this subgenre are La Noche and Américo). Also in the 2000s, a style called New Chilean cumbia or “Cuambia Rock” emerged, led by bands like (Chico Trujillo, Pánico and Juana Fe). This new Chilean cumbia is highly influenced by rock and some hip hop groups, although in some cases the influence of Andean music, Balkan music Klezmer, Salsa and Bolero can be heard. It main exponents are Chico Trujillo, Juana Fe, La Mano Ajena, Cholomandinga, Combo Ginebra, La María Goyo (psychedelic cumbia) and [...]|$|R
