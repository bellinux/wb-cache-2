50|$|Bismarck {{built on}} a {{tradition}} of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old-age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that {{formed the basis of}} the modern European welfare state. He came to realize that this sort of policy was very appealing, since it bound workers to the state, and also fit in very well with his authoritarian nature. The social security systems installed by Bismarck (health care in 1883, accident <b>insurance</b> in 1884, <b>invalidity</b> and old-age <b>insurance</b> in 1889) at the time were the largest in the world and, to a degree, still exist in Germany today.|$|R

50|$|In social policy, {{a number}} of {{progressive}} reforms were realised during Spaak's first premiership. An Act of June 1938 “increased {{the functions of the}} National Society for Cheap Houses and Dwellings and empowered it, under State guarantee, to contract a loan of 350 million francs,” while a Royal Decree of July 1938 laid down the rules of applying the provisions of a Holidays with Pay Act passed in 1936 to agricultural, horticultural and forestry undertakings. An Act of the 20th of August 1938 amended and supplemented a Holidays with Pay Act previously passed in 1936 by extending its coverage to all undertakings, whatever their number of wage earners, as well as to home workers. The Act also removed a previous requirement in which a wage earner had to work {{for at least a year}} with the same employer in order to earn an annual holiday. An Act of the 8th of July 1938 amended the miners' old-age, <b>invalidity</b> and survivors' <b>insurance</b> scheme by increasing the benefits payable to invalids, aged persons and widows already in receipt of a pension, while also significantly widening the conditions for the grant of invalidity pensions. An Order of the 25th of August 1938 prohibited the use of so-called motor spirit “for greasing, cleaning (hands) etc.,” while a Royal Order of the 27th of August 1938 fixed normal weekly hours of actual work in the ship-repairing industry in Antwerp at 42 hours “distributed over the seven days of the week.” A Royal Order of the 27th of December 1938 extended the scope of an eight-hour Act passed in June 1921 to cover technical staff employed in cinemas, and a Royal Order of the 22nd of December 1938 amended the entries in the second column of the schedule (list of occupations) which was now brought into conformity with Convention No.42, and added “in the case of pneumoconiosis, sand-blasting processes in iron and steel foundries.|$|R

5000|$|Both Henry's {{personal}} and political lives were intertwined with that of David Lloyd George. When Lloyd George formed his coalition government with the Conservatives in December 1916, Henry {{was one of those}} Liberals who stayed on the government side and he was generally identified as a strong supporter of the new prime minister. But there was more than just political affinity between Henry and Lloyd George. Henry and his wife had been close to Lloyd George since at least the time of the death of his daughter Mair in 1907. Henry hosted a trip to Germany for Lloyd George in 1908 to allow Lloyd George, then recently appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer, to study the <b>invalidity</b> <b>insurance</b> and contributory old age pensions which had been introduced there by Otto von Bismarck twenty-five years before. They also travelled together abroad socially to Nice and Monte Carlo [...] and other European destinations.The American Lady Henry had pretensions to be one of London's great political hostesses and Lloyd George often attended her functions in London and at their home at Henley-on-Thames, sometimes taking his son Richard with him. Lloyd George also attended Henry family occasions at Henry’s London home at Carlton Gardens. It is not known for certain if Lloyd George and Julia Henry had an affair, although one of Lloyd George’s biographers states that they did, adding that it was not serious on Lloyd George's part. However they certainly flirted together and corresponded privately with each other. Richard Lloyd George apparently thought his father could be in love with the “dark, tall and very attractive Lady J.” [...] and that they were having an affair. Even King Edward VII was concerned {{that there had been a}} lot of gossip about Lady Julia and Lloyd George and this may have delayed her husband's getting his knighthood. Frances Stevenson certainly believed that Lloyd George had not only been close to Lady Henry but that Lady Henry herself was clearly in love with him describing her as 'quite mad' about him. After Frances Stevenson started working for Lloyd George in 1911 and he began to become attracted to her, Lloyd George determined to stop any dalliance with Julia Henry. She was distressed by what she saw as a public snub and fled back to America, writing to her husband that she never wanted to be alone with Lloyd George again. It seems unlikely that Henry himself was aware of anything going on from Lloyd George's side. If anything he seems to have thought it was all in his wife's mind and believed she was exaggerating their relationship. It is also clear that Lady Henry's hurt feelings had a lot to do with the damage Lloyd George's rejection could do to her reputation as a political hostess.Some reconciliation was affected in 1915 when Lloyd George visited the Henrys to show sympathy on the loss of their son in battle even though he was reluctant to do so because of the awkwardness arising from his previous relationship with Lady Henry and the strength of Julia Henry’s feelings for him. Lloyd George also visited Henry when he was ill and dying in 1919, despite Lady Henry’s making a scene and her trying to use his visits to her advantage with other members of the social set. However the final breach with Lady Julia came the year after Henry’s death in recriminations over Lloyd George’s alleged misuse of £20,000 donated by American friends of the Henrys for British war charities.|$|E
30|$|We {{note that}} as the Irish social {{insurance}} system matures and as economic change occurs, the balance between different benefits changes, for example, one can see from Figure  4 b that the share of survivor’s insurance benefits approaches 100 % while the share of survivor’s assistance benefits approaches 100 %. In terms of the disability benefits, Figure  4 d shows that the share applying to <b>invalidity</b> <b>insurance</b> increases around 2006 but subsequently declines as the share for carers benefit recipients increases. As the economic crisis arose in 2008, the share of those in receipt of short term unemployment benefits rose, before falling as the share of longer termed unemployed rose as shown in Figure  4 a. We utilise the equations to predict the disaggregation of highest probability and then rank this variable to select the most likely disaggregated benefits.|$|E
40|$|Intra-articular {{fractures}} of the calcaneus typically {{occur in}} individuals working on ladders, scaffolding or roofs. Male individuals in their productive age are most at risk. The functional problems that frequently persist are a well-known risk since they may obstruct a safe resumption {{of the former}} job. According to the data of the National Institute for Sickness and <b>Invalidity</b> <b>Insurance</b> the number of calcaneal fractures in Belgium have stabilised over the last ten years. These figures indicate the necessity for a better prevention policy. Scientific literature {{about the problem of}} impairment and disability in these cases is rare and lacks uniformity. A retrospective study was therefore performed on 65 private insurance compensation patients who were treated for intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The mean period of work incapacity was 260. 5 days and the mean percentage of impairment was 12. 3 %. A large group (86. 2 %) were able to resume their former activities including the height workers. More than half of the patients (57 %) needed a supportive device. Working at heights and falls from a height were a significant risk factor for long-term work incapacity.

40|$|In Gosta Esping-Andersen’s {{paradigmatic}} {{analysis of}} welfare capitalism (1990), the French welfare state is {{classified in the}} conservative corporatist regime. 1 France is generally recognized as belonging to the Bismarckian family of welfare states because of the centrality of social insurance. In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component. It refers to the tax-financed system and includes social assistance programs, minimum incomes and programs aimed at vocational training, and at integrating the young or long-term unemployed. These programs benefit those who {{do not have access to}} the social insurance system, such as the long-term unemployed or the young unemployed who have not contributed enough or have only a very short contribution period. Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, allowance for disabled adults, integration allowance, specific solidarity allowance, lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small <b>invalidity</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits), widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{simulate}} direct-digital cephalometric procedures and to record the head movements of probands. This study was prompted by the Committee for Insurance Matters of the Swiss National <b>Invalidity</b> <b>Insurance</b> which does not accept scanned digital cephalometric radiographs as a basis for its decisions. The reason for this is the required scanning time of several seconds during which even slight head movements can lead to kinetic blurring and landmark displacement. Incorrect angular measurements may result. By means of a Sirognathograph and a cephalostat of non-ferromagnetic material, the head movements of a total of 264 subjects were recorded in three dimensions, with a scanning time of up to 25 seconds. In a second series, the influence of a chin support to reduce head movements was also tested. The results of the first series of tests showed that, with an increasing scan time, movements became greater, mostly in the sagittal plane, and that maximum displacements could occur already at the start of the recording. With a scan time of 10 seconds the median movement amplitude in the vertical dimension was 2. 14 mm. The second series of tests revealed a significant reduction in head movements in all dimensions owing to an additional stabilizing chin support. To minimize head movements, scanning times must be reduced and additional head stabilizing elements together with existing ones are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{tailored}} professional intervention, including academic detailing, on antibiotic prescribing for acute cough. Methods: In a cluster-randomized controlled before and after study 85 Flemish GPs included adult patients with acute cough consulting in the periods February–April 2000 and 2001. The intervention consisted of a clinical practice guideline for acute cough, an educational outreach visit and a postal reminder to support its implementation in January 2001. Antibiotic prescribing rates and patients’ symptom resolution were the main outcome measures. Results: Thirty-six of 42 GPs received the intervention and 35 of 43 GPs served as controls; 1503 patients were eligible for analysis. Only in the intervention group were patients less likely to receive antibiotics after the intervention [ORadj (95 % CI) 5 0. 56 (0. 36 – 0. 87) ]. Prescribed antibiotics were also more in line with the guideline in the intervention group [1. 90 (0. 96 – 3. 75) ] and less expensive {{from the perspective of the}} National Sickness and <b>Invalidity</b> <b>Insurance</b> Institute {MDadj (95 % CI) 5 –e 6. 89 [211. 77 2 (22. 02) ]}.

Conclusions: An (inter) actively delivered tailored intervention implementing a guideline for acute cough is successful in optimizing antibiotic prescribing without affecting patients ’ symptom resol-ution. Further research efforts should be devoted to cost-effectiveness studies of such interventions...|$|E
40|$|Randomized {{response}} (RR) is {{a well-known}} method for measuring sensitive behavior. Yet this method is not often applied because: (i) of its lower efficiency and the resulting need for larger sample sizes which make applications of RR costly; (ii) despite its privacy-protection mechanism the RR design may not be followed by every respondent; and (iii) the incorrect belief that RR yields estimates only of aggregate-level behavior but that these estimates cannot be linked to individual-level covariates. This paper addresses the efficiency problem by applying item randomized-response (IRR) models {{for the analysis of}} multivariate RR data. In these models, a person parameter is estimated based on multiple measures of a sensitive behavior under study which allow for more powerful analyses of individual differences than available from univariate RR data. Response behavior that does not follow the RR design is approached by introducing mixture components in the IRR models with one component consisting of respondents who answer truthfully and another component consisting of respondents who do not provide truthful responses. An analysis of data from two large-scale Dutch surveys conducted among recipients of <b>invalidity</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits shows that the willingness of a respondent to answer truthfully is related to the educational level of the respondents and the perceived clarity of the instructions. A person is more willing to comply when the expected benefits of noncompliance are minor and social control is strong.
