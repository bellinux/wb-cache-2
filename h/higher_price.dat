5|$|Industry {{observers}} have attributed Lexus' early marketing successes {{to higher levels}} of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors, which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass-market cars.

Lexus has since grown to command <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> premiums than rival Japanese makes, with new models further increasing in price and reaching the more than $100,000 ultra-luxury category long dominated by rival European marques.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods.

Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers.

5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>price.</b> The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E
5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a <b>higher</b> <b>price,</b> just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; {{for the first six months}} of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>prices</b> {{are often}} {{reported}} {{as an obstacle}} that inhibits the purchase of organic food products. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate how organic food products perform at different price levels and whether <b>high</b> <b>prices</b> are an advantage or a disadvantage for consumers’ repeat purchase of organic food. Based on analyses of actual purchase data, this study explores the effect of two product attributes (production method and price) on repeat purchase. The analysis is based on purchase data for four product categories (red meat, chicken, milk and hard cheese) registered by the GfK panel in 2011 in Denmark. The results show that within product categories, repeat purchase is linked more to production method than to price, and it is more prevalent for organic compared to conventional food, and for <b>high</b> <b>price</b> compared to low and medium price. Cross-purchasing of both organic and <b>high</b> <b>price</b> products is <b>high.</b> Low <b>price</b> leads to <b>highest</b> repeat purchase within individual organic product categories. <b>High</b> <b>price</b> is linked to the highest levels of cross-purchase across organic products. However, other market performance criteria are better for the organic medium price tier. These findings have several practical implications. For producers, it is important to know that low price actually stimulates repeat purchase. For retailers, <b>high</b> <b>price</b> levels might stimulate cross-purchases in a wider organic assortment...|$|R
5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a <b>higher</b> <b>price,</b> generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly <b>higher</b> <b>price.</b> After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
