This system evolved out of the wagering of small stakes on club games in the early 19th century.|$|E

500|$|As well as gaining {{critical}} acclaim, {{the series}} {{has been the}} subject of controversy over its content. This controversy began with the localized banner title of the original Persona, which raised concerns due to its religious implications. Kurt Katala, writing for 1UP.com in 2006 about the controversial content of the Megami Tensei franchise as a whole, mentioned Innocent Sins references to homosexuality, schoolyard violence, and Nazism, considering them possible reasons why the title was not originally released in the West. In 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Persona 3 was given the [...] "Most controversial game that created no controversy" [...] award: the writers said [...] "Rockstar's Hot Coffee sex scandal and Bullys boy-on-boy kissing's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating".

Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon why they had fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with you, you're only the driver." ...|$|E

[...] In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: [...] "I don't understand it. All we're trying to do is destroy everything." [...] At the end of August came SPOTS—Sex Pistols On Tour Secretly, a surreptitious UK tour with the band playing under pseudonyms to avoid cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Alongside its {{critical}} acclaim, {{the series}} has garnered controversy both in Japan and overseas. Amongst the material cited are its demon negotiation mechanic, depictions of suicide and cannibalism, religious criticism, its use and mixture of Christian and occult imagery, political references, depictions of homosexuality, and its sometimes-strange demon designs. Specific examples {{have been cited}} by western journalists. The original release of Persona caused concern due to the title's religious implications. 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Persona 3 was given the [...] "Most controversial game that created no controversy" [...] award: the writers said [...] "Rockstar's Hot Coffee sex scandal and Bullys boy-on-boy kissing's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating." [...] GamesRadar included the series on its list of [...] "Controversies Waiting to Happen", saying {{that the lack of}} public outcry was due to its niche status when compared to other series with similar content. Writing for 1UP.com in a later article, Kalata traced this use of controversial content back to the Digital Devil Story novels, which depicted violence and rape committed by demons, and said that [...] "Such violence is not particularly rare in the land of Japanese animation, but it became even more disturbing in [...] ".|$|E

[...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need {{to be the one}} who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go".

500|$|Best {{was sacked}} from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, by manager Brian Epstein acting {{on behalf of}} Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Accounts vary of Aspinall during this event. According to MerseyBeat editor Bill Harry, Aspinall was waiting downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop, and {{was the first one to}} talk to the by then ex-Beatle in the Grapes pub, across from the Cavern. Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for the band as well, but Best {{strongly}} advised him not to. Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best and was told, [...] "It’s <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with you. You’re only the driver." [...] However, in a 2007 interview, Aspinall provided Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn with a distinctly different version of events, saying that he was physically present when Epstein sacked Best, that he told Best unprompted that he planned to continue working for the band, and that on his first subsequent encounter with the other band members, their first question to him was how Best had taken being sacked. At any rate, Aspinall stayed with the band, but he ended his affair with Best's mother, a relationship that had led to the birth of baby Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best. Aspinall denied the story for years before publicly acknowledging that he was indeed Roag's father.|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll I Do, a nifty, '60s-style soul stirrer, it's clear that Jackson's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team has obviously {{been listening to the}} competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but she gets the job done." ...|$|E
