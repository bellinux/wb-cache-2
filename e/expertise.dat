40|$|International audienceOur paper {{deals with}} the update of component-based {{software}} architectures, i. e. all the modifications which can be performed on the architecture's elements to satisfy various requirements. Current researches on the component-based software engineering propose various mechanisms to adapt, evolve, customize, or reconfigure such architectures. We are convince that these mechanisms, even powerful, still require the architects' <b>expertises.</b> Moreover, it is noticed that these <b>expertises</b> conform to a style, i. e. a way of update which privileges certain concerns rather than others. It is what explains why a solution is selected instead of another, for the same main update issue. Our goal is to define updating styles, to represent and reuse update <b>expertises.</b> We wish to use this work to build an environment based on an updating style library in order to assist architects in modifying their component-based architectures...|$|R

5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess <b>expertise.</b> The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of <b>expertise</b> has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of <b>expertise</b> in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E
