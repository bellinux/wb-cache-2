2500|$|A shorter {{version of}} “Strix's” article {{appeared}} in The Spectator {{and this is}} the fourth essay of the book. “Strix”, pseudonym of [...] Peter Fleming, was a British adventurer and travel writer, who was James Bond author Ian Fleming’s elder brother and a friend of Nancy. He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally, and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the [...] "national interest". <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> article hoping (ironically) that the U-young will strive for a clear, classless medium of communication in which all say [...] "Pardon?" [...] and none say [...] "What?", and every ball is a dance and every man's wife is [...] "the" [...] wife, but then saying that he will be surprised and disappointed if they do anything of the sort.|$|E

6000|$|... [Then, raising himself, <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> brother's eyes, {{and as he}} [...] does so, catches {{sight of}} a paper pinned to the couch; detaches [...] it and reads:] ...|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> piano softly, softly {{changes his}} coat for a pea-jacket, with a goodly wicker-cased bottle in its largest pocket, {{and putting on}} a low-crowned, flap-brimmed hat, goes softly out. Why does he move so softly to-night? No outward reason is {{apparent}} for it. Can there be any sympathetic reason crouching darkly within him? ...|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> {{professional}} career with two {{seasons in the}} Continental Basketball Association.|$|R
60|$|His voice sank {{to a low}} mumble, and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> eyes wearily.|$|R

6000|$|... "To be sure, a {{man must}} {{like to take}} a kind leave of his own wife before <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes for ever; and I dare say {{it would be a great}} relief to you to tell him that you have {{forgotten}} his desertion of you, and all the hardships it has brought upon you in searching for him, and in earning your own livelihood as a common sailor." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the back}} of the tent drops into place, and all is {{darkness}} again--whatever it is is inside the tent with him. He hears it creeping close to him--now it is beside him. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes and waits for the mighty paw. Upon his upturned face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark, and then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his name.|$|E
6000|$|... "The evil {{nature is}} growing {{stronger}} every day. He is developing [...] {{a sort of}} ferocious cunning to help him in his crimes. He [...] wanders about in the dark, wearing a black velvet suit with [...] holes for his eyes, and leaving only his hands exposed. I have [...] watched him come into a half-darkened room and one can see [...] nothing but the hands and the eyes; sometimes if <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> [...] eyes, only the hands." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> eyes again, and I did not further disturb him.|$|R
60|$|Then, hearing Markey {{open the}} door, <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> eyes and feigned sleep.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in a treasure that fastens upon a man's mind. He will pray and blaspheme and still persevere, and will curse the day he ever heard of it, and will let his last hour come upon him unawares, still believing that he missed it only by a foot. He will see it every time <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes. He will never forget it till he is dead--and even then----Doctor, {{did you ever hear}} of the miserable gringos on Azuera, that cannot die? Ha! ha! Sailors like myself. There is no getting away from a treasure that once fastens upon your mind." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{might tell}} Mark Twain that in France {{a man who}} was seen tipsy in his club would {{immediately}} see his name canceled from membership. A man who had settled his fortune on his wife to avoid meeting his creditors would be refused admission into any decent society. Many a Frenchman has blown his brains out rather than declare himself a bankrupt. Now would Mark Twain remark to this: 'An American is not such a fool: when a creditor stands in his way <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> doors, and reopens them the following day. When he has been a bankrupt three times he can retire from business?']--It is a good answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Friedrich's {{own view}} of these sad matters, as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> History of the Seven-Years War [at [...] "Berlin, 17th December, 1763"], is in these words: 'May Heaven grant,--if Heaven deign {{to look down}} on the paltry {{concerns}} of men,--that the unalterable and flourishing destiny of this Country preserve the Sovereigns who shall govern it from the scourges and calamities which Prussia has suffered in these times of trouble and subversion; that they may never again be forced to recur to the violent and fatal remedies which we (L'ON) have been obliged to employ in maintenance of the State against the ambitious hatred of the Sovereigns of Europe, who wished to annihilate the House of Brandenburg, and exterminate from the world whatever bore the Prussian name!'"

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> eyes languidly, {{and kept}} them closed until {{the men had}} departed.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> eyes. The cigar {{dropped from}} his fingers. There {{was a long}} silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{and with}} a smile he fell asleep. Uncle Tom too was free.|$|R
60|$|And thus vanishes, in sour dark clouds, {{the once}} great Belleisle. Grandiose, {{something}} almost of great in him, of sublime,--alas, yes, of too sublime; and of unfortunate beyond proportion, paying the debt of many foregoers! He too is a notability gone out, {{the last of}} his kind. Twenty years ago, he crossed the OEil-de-Boeuf with Papers, just setting out to cut Teutschland in Four; and in the Rue de Lille, No. 54, with that grandiose Enterprise drawing to its issue in universal defeat, disgrace, discontent and preparation for the General Overturn (CULBUTE GENERALE of 1789)) <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> weary old eyes. Choiseul succeeds him as War-Minister; War-Minister and Prime-Minister both in one;--and by many arts of legerdemain, and another real spasm of effort upon Hanover to do the impossible there, is leading France with winged steps the same road.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} is taken by surprise, never having dreamt {{of a state}} of {{existence}} where existence itself seems suspended. He shakes himself in his coat, to see whether it be empty or no. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes, to test the reality of the glassy expanse. He fetches a deep breath, by way of experiment, {{and for the sake of}} witnessing the effect. If a reader of books, Priestley on Necessity occurs to him; and he believes in that old Sir Anthony Absolute to the very last chapter. His faith in Malte Brun, however, begins to fail; for the geography, which from boyhood he had implicitly confided in, always assured him, that though expatiating all over the globe, the sea was at least margined by land. That over against America, for example, was Asia. But it is a calm, and he grows madly skeptical.|$|E
6000|$|BLOOM: (Bloom trickleaps to the {{curbstone}} and halts again. He brushes a mudflake {{from his}} cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. Day {{the wheel of}} the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (<b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes an instant) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow! ...|$|E

60|$|The Reverend Mr. Crane (so often {{chaplain}} of the Legislature, {{and known}} to the irreverent as the chaplain of the Northeastern) is praying now for guidance in the counsels of this great gathering of the people's representatives. God will hear Mr. Botcher better if <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes; which he does. Now the platform is being read by State Senator Billings; closed eyes would best suit this proceeding, too. As a parallel to that platform, one can think only of the Ten Commandments. The Republican Party (chosen children of Israel) must be kept free from the domination of corporations. (Cheers and banner waving for a full minute.) Some better method of choosing delegates which will more truly reflect {{the will of the}} people. (Plank of the Honourable Jacob Botcher, whose conscience is awakening.) Never mind the rest. It is a triumph for Mr. Crewe, and is all printed in that orthodox (reform) newspaper, the State Tribune, with urgent editorials that it must be carried out to the letter.|$|E
60|$|Of course if {{you come}} to the place fresh from New York, you are deceived. Your {{standard}} of vision is all astray, You do think the place is quiet. You do imagine that Mr. Smith is asleep merely because <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes as he stands. But live in Mariposa for six months or a year and then you will begin to understand it better; the buildings get higher and higher; the Mariposa House grows more and more luxurious; McCarthy's block towers to the sky; the 'buses roar and hum to the station; the trains shriek; the traffic multiplies; the people move faster and faster; a dense crowd swirls to and fro in the post-office and the five and ten cent store--and amusements! well, now! lacrosse, baseball, excursions, dances, the Fireman's Ball every winter and the Catholic picnic every summer; and music--the town band in the park every Wednesday evening, and the Oddfellows' brass band on the street every other Friday; the Mariposa Quartette, the Salvation Army--why, after a few months' residence you begin to realize that the place is a mere mad round of gaiety.|$|E
6000|$|For these catholic {{principles}} he {{was most}} roughly handled. Deune, in a pamphlet in the Editor's possession, called him a devil; and likened him to Timri, who slew his master. The most learned of the Baptist ministers entered upon the controversy. They invited him to a grand religious tournament, where he would have stood one against a legion. A great meeting was appointed, in London, for a public disputation--as was common among the puritans--and in which the poor country mechanic was to be overwhelmed with scholastic learning and violence; but Bunyan wisely avoided a collision which could have answered no valuable purpose, and which bid fair to excite angry feelings. He had appealed to the press as the calmest and best mode of controversy; and to that mode of appeal he adhered. Three learned men undertook the cause against Bunyan: these were, D'Anvers, W. Kiffin, and T. Paul. When these lettered, able, and distinguished disputants published their joint answer, it contained much scurrilous abuse. Their brother, Bunyan, was in prison, and they visited him with gall and wormwood. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> reply with these remarkable words, 'Thine to serve thee, Christians, so long as I can look out at those eyes that have had so much dirt thrown at them by many.' ...|$|E
