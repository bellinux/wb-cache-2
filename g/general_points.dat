5|$|After the Second World War, no one {{dominated}} the Tour until Louison Bobet, who won three consecutive Tours from 1953 to 1955—he {{was the first}} person to achieve this feat. This was bettered by the French cyclist Jacques Anquetil, who won four successive Tours from 1961 to 1964. Anquetil, who also won in 1957, became the first to win five Tours. Anquetil's five victories were matched when Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx won four successive Tours from 1969 to 1972 and the 1974 Tour. Merckx is the only person to have won the <b>general,</b> <b>points</b> and king of the mountains classifications in the same Tour. He achieved this in 1969, when he won his first Tour.|$|E

40|$|Why should I be moral? My {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to exploring how David Hume’s moral theory may answer this question. According to Hume’s psychology of action, only passions, desires and dispositions have motivational force, but reason alone has not. As Hume believes that morality is action-guided, he bases his moral theory on sentiments. The advantage of a sentiment-based theory is that it easily explains why we follow morality: as we have moral sentiments, {{we already have a}} motive to follow morality. However, it seems that a moral theory based on sentiments hardly explains why we follow impartial judgments, for original sentiments arising from sympathy are always partial. proposes a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view to correct unregulated sympathy. Adopting a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view, we leave aside personal interest and view a person through the eyes of those who are in his narrow circle according to the effects his character tends to cause. However, there seems be tension between sentimentalism and Hume’s <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view. It is doubtful whether the judgments made from a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view are still sentiment-based and how we are moved to leave our personal standpoint to take up a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view when we are naturally more concerned with our own self-interest. Hence, the main difficulty for Hume’s moral theory is to explain what causes us to adopt a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view and act morally in a sentimentalist framework. I suggest that {{to get rid of the}} contradiction in the soul caused by our sympathy with others’ sentiments is the primary motive for us to adopt a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> of view. Moreover, understanding the limitations of human nature, we do not have overly high expectation of people; hence, we are satisfied with a person if he benefits his narrow circle and therefore limit ourselves to a <b>general</b> <b>point</b> view. published_or_final_versionPhilosophyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
