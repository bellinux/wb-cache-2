25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game {{was up in the}} Peloponnese. On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> that he had declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E

If there was ever a time for a Butthole Surfers album it's fucking now. It just doesn't get any weirder than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck Kleinhans {{states that}} the {{difference}} between a guilty pleasure and a cult film {{can be as simple as}} the number of fans; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> that home video makes fans difficult to count. [...] As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as camp, irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof. [...] Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the film's faults, can make minor celebrities of the film's cast, though the benefits are not always clear. [...] Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously. [...] Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. [...] This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle, method-inspired acting. [...] Mark Chalon Smith of the Los Angeles Times says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. [...] Smith {{states that the}} early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema. [...] Films such as [...] Myra Breckinridge (1970) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted, and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. [...] Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.|$|E

2500|$|Still, some {{observers}} believe that, given the depressed {{state of the}} industry and the rapidly strengthening economic and political ties among Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan, the distinctive entity of Hong Kong cinema that emerged after World War II may have a limited lifespan. [...] The lines between the mainland and Hong Kong industries are ever more blurred, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> that China is producing increasing numbers of slick, mass-appeal popular films. [...] Predictions are notoriously difficult in this rapidly changing part of the world, but the trend may be towards a more pan-Chinese cinema, as existed {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
2500|$|The Bonds {{controversy}} continues, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> {{that he has}} {{surpassed the}} All-Time Home Run record with 762 career home runs; the media continues to pressure Bonds with questions over the issue.

[...] Bonds had admitted that he did use a clear substance and lotion {{given to him by}} his trainer but had no idea that they were any sort of performance enhancers. Bonds claimed that to his knowledge, the substances given to him were legal to treat his arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|Claymoor {{soon became}} one of the regulars at the journalists' hangout, Casa Capșa, frequenting a society that also {{included}} Nicolae Filipescu and N. T. Orășanu. Memoirist Constantin Bacalbașa recalls him as [...] "perfectly collegial", [...] "a very decent man". However, he also cautions that Claymoor [...] "was a journalist, but by no means was he one of the journalistic world; he lived inside the boyar society that had spawned and raised him". More controversially, from 1888, when he became a Romanian delegate to the Paris World Fair, Claymoor was depicted as a political client of the ruling Conservative Party. Reports of that have it that he was also considered for the Prefecture of Constanța County by the Theodor Rosetti cabinet. A local correspondent for Telegraphul noted, tongue-in-cheek: [...] "High-society ladies are in favor of [...] appointment, and so is the Muslim population, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> [...] that we are celebrating Bayram." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later that year, her {{writings}} on arson attacks in Frankfurt as {{protests against the}} Vietnam War resulted in her developing an acquaintance with the perpetrators, most significantly Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. She stopped writing for konkret which had in her opinion evolved into a completely commercial magazine {{in the early part}} of 1969, and many other authors followed her. She stated that neither she nor her collaborators wanted to give a left-wing alibi to the magazine, that sooner or later [...] "would become part of the counter-revolution, a thing that I cannot gloss over with my co-operation, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> that it is impossible to deter its course". Later, they organised an occupation at konkrets office (along with several members of the [...] ), to distribute proclamations to the employees, something that failed since Röhl learned about it, and moved the employees to their homes to continue their work from there. Finally, Röhl's house was vandalised by some of the protesters. Meinhof arrived in Röhl's villa at 11:30, after police and journalists had already arrived. She was accused by Röhl (and subsequently described by the media) as the organizer of the vandalism. It was difficult to prove, as she was not there when it happened.|$|E
