40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the in vitro <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation</b> of a sustained release formulation for {{human growth hormone}} (hGH) based on hydroxyethyl methacrylated dextran (dex-HEMA) microspheres in Pit- 1 deficient Snell dwarf mice and in healthy human volunteers. Materials and Methods. A hGH-loaded microsphere formulation was developed and tested in Snell dwarf mice (pharmacodynamic study) and in healthy human volunteers (pharmacokinetic study). Results. Single subcutaneous administration of the microspheres in mice resulted in a good correlation between hGH released in vitro and in vivo effects for the hGH-loaded microsphere formulation similar to daily injected hGH indicating a retained bioactivity. Testing the microspheres in healthy volunteers showed an increase (over 7 – 8 days) in hGH serum concentrations (peak concentrations: 1 – 2. 5 ng/ml). A good in vitro <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation</b> was obtained between the measured and calculated (from in vitro release data) hGH serum concentrations. Moreover, an increased serum concentration of biomarkers (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) was found again indicating that bioactive hGH {{was released from the}} microspheres. Conclusions. Good in vitro in vivo correlations were obtained for hGH-loaded dex-HEMA microspheres, which is an important advantage in predicting the effect of the controlled drug delivery product in a clinical situations.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} {{the contribution of}} OATP 1 B transport proteins in the hepatic clearance of HIV protease inhibitors in humans. We measured the uptake of HIV protease inhibitors in OATP 1 B 1 / 1 B 3 -expressing CHO cells and extrapolated these to uptake clearance values in human hepatocytes by applying a relative activity factor between OATP-transfected cells and human hepatocytes. Metabolic clearance values of all HIV protease inhibitors were determined in pooled human liver microsomes. Based on the individual processes or on the combination of both uptake and metabolism, the in vivo hepatic clearance was calculated. Subsequently, we compared the calculated and published in vivo clearance values. Our results revealed an improved in vitro – <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation</b> between predicted and reported clearance values when only uptake clearance values were used (R 2 = 0. 71) as compared to prediction based on only metabolism (R 2 = 0. 44).

In vitro biochemical information concerning the detoxication of environmental chemicals is also presented. The discussion leads to a more complete appreciation for the use of in vitro measurements for <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlations.</b> The concept of interspecies scaling in the interpolation and extrapolation of fundamental biochemical metabolic processes is illustrated with a number of examples. Additional examples of <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> <b>correlations</b> are presented <b>in</b> the evaluation of the impact of chemical exposure to humans. Finally, several important metabolic detoxication enzymes are presented, including the mammalian microsomal cytochrome P 450 and flavin-containing monooxygenases as well as carboxylesterases and glucuronosyltransferases, to provide insight into the processes of chemical detoxication in mammalian tissue and blood. Because interspecies scaling and the pharmacokinetics of chemical disposition have already shown their usefulness in understanding some examples of chemical disposition, our summary focuses on showing the usefulness of the pharmacokinetic equations and providing confidence in using the approach for <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> <b>correlations.</b> Ultimately, the presentation may provide the reader with a conceptual framework for future evaluation of the human health risks associated with environmental toxicants.

40|$|Numerous chronic lung {{diseases}} are characterised by oxidative stress or more accurately, perturbations in redox cycling and signalling. Cellular redox alterations lead to phenotypic adaptations such as increased cell proliferation, altered differentiation and induction of apoptosis. Biomarkers that reflect changes in cellular oxidation {{states as a}} function of normal redox signalling as well as following environmental insults would be extremely useful for studying disease processes in the lung in vitro and in vivo. One current area of interest in this field is the Peroxiredoxins (Prxs), a family of ubiquitously expressed antioxidant (AO) enzymes. The aim of this project was to assess the utility of measuring the changes in Prx expression levels and oxidation states as a quantitative biomarker of oxidative lung injury. Utilising normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) primary cells, which were cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), Prx status was analysed throughout culture morphogenesis, and following oxidative insult via glucose oxidase (GOx) and cigarette smoke (CS) exposures. Human <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation</b> was also undertaken, using lung tissue from COPD (GOLD 4) patients. Results were analysed using conventional toxicology, Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. Preliminary results revealed elevated basal levels of oxidative stress within the NHBE model, which was alleviated via the addition of AO to the media. Following GOx and CS exposures, there was increased Prx hyperoxidation in conjunction with variations in expression. A dose-dependant response to GOx and CS was observed in the NHBE cultures +AO. Variations in Prx expression levels and oxidation state were also detected throughout the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation,</b> with specific Prx responses observed in the different stages of airway remodelling. The Prxs were determined to be sensitive and reliable biomarkers of intracellular oxidative stress, injury severity and epithelial remodelling, thus indicating a role for the Prxs as an 'early stage' biomarker, with disruptions in redox state occurring in advance of phenotypic or morphological adaptations. Additionally, by eliminating the issue of interspecies reactivity, there may be a potential role for the NHBE-Prx system as an in vivo pre-screening tool.

Bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cell colony formation, both granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythrocyte (BFU-E), was shown to be decreased in number in SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys. SIVmac was readily isolated from bone marrow cells of infected monkeys and was shown to be harbored in macrophages rather than T lymphocytes. The in vitro infection of normal bone marrow cells by SIVmac inhibited colony formation. A striking <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation</b> between increased SIVmac load in bone marrow cells and decreased hematopoietic progenitor cell colony growth was also shown. Finally, inhibition of SIVmac replication in bone marrow macrophages resulted in increased progenitor cell colony growth from bone marrow cells. These {{results suggest that the}} infection of bone marrow macrophages by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus may contribute to depressed bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cell growth. Moreover, inhibition of AIDS virus replication in these macrophages might induce significant improvement in hematopoietic function...|$|E

We also report pharmaceutical perspectives of these topics and compare methods and interpretations for the drug development process...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} EU {{ban on the}} use {{of animals}} in the testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients from 2009 together with the ethical reasons for avoiding tests on human beings have recently prompted the development of guidelines on in vitro alternative methods and an extensive search for novel validated in vitro permeation models. The prediction of the percutaneous absorption by means of in vitro methodologies requires good <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation.</b> Moreover, due to differences in the type of vehicle (conventional vehicles or particulate carriers) and in the physicochemical properties of the substance, such as its solubility, the selection of appropriate in vitro conditions is crucial. In particular, the validation of an in vitro skin penetration model appears quite difficult for highly lipophilic substances, because of their limited rate of transfer between stratum corneum and the viable epidermis, due to their low solubility in most physiological receptor fluids. This chapter focuses on comparative <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> skin permeation of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, a highly lipophilic UV-A absorber (log Po/w = 5. 6), methylbenzylidene camphor (log Po/w = 4. 8) a less lipophilic sunscreen agent, and glycolic acid, a hydrophilic active substance (log Po/w < 0). Special attention is paid to the influence of the in vitro receptor medium on the <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation.</b> Skin absorptio...|$|R
40|$|A {{biopharmaceutics}} drug {{classification scheme}} for correlating in vitro drug product dissolution and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> bioavailability is proposed based on recognizing that drug dissolution and gastrointestinal permeability are the fundamental parameters controlling rate {{and extent of}} drug absorption. This analysis uses a transport model and human permeability results for estimating <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> drug absorption to illustrate the primary importance of solubility and permeability on drug absorption. The fundamental parameters which define oral drug absorption in humans resulting from this analysis are discussed and used {{as a basis for}} this classification scheme. These Biopharmaceutic Drug Classes are defined as: Case 1. High solubility-high permeability drugs, Case 2. Low solubility-high permeability drugs, Case 3. High solubility-low permeability drugs, and Case 4. Low solubility-low permeability drugs. Based on this classification scheme, suggestions are made for setting standards for in vitro drug dissolution testing methodology which will correlate with the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> process. This methodology must be based on the physiological and physical chemical properties controlling drug absorption. This analysis points out conditions under which no <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> <b>correlation</b> may be expected e. g. rapidly dissolving low permeability drugs. Furthermore, it is suggested for example that for very rapidly dissolving high solubility drugs, e. g. 85 % dissolution in less than 15 minutes, a simple one point dissolution test, is all that may be needed to insure bioavailability. For slowly dissolving drugs a dissolution profile is required with multiple time points in systems which would include low pH, physiological pH, and surfactants and the in vitro conditions should mimic the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> processes. This classification scheme provides a basis for establishing <b>in</b> vitro-in <b>vivo</b> <b>correlations</b> and for estimating the absorption of drugs based on the fundamental dissolution and permeability properties of physiologic importance...|$|R
