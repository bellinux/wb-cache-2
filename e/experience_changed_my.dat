40|$|My name is Joyce Liu and I {{am going}} into my 4 th {{year of the}} Honours Double Major in Biology and Physiology program. I decided to pursue a double major because I was {{intrigued}} by many {{different aspects of the}} biological sciences. Specifically, I was very interested in translational research; how findings from basic science can be applied and used to further understand human diseases and behaviour. One area that I wished to learn more about was behavioural genetics. Through the Work Study program at Western, I was able to complement my studies with my interests by participating in research with Ryan Calhoun, a PhD candidate at Dr. Amanda Moehring’s lab. I found this experience to be very rewarding because I witnessed first-hand the amount of dedication, hard work, and commitment that goes into research. It has really inspired me to push myself further in hopes of making a difference in the scientific community.

Key organizational implications were found. First, {{a significant amount of}} private knowledge was harvested from a broad population of organization members.

40|$|The book known {{nowadays}} as Naufragios by Álvar Núez Cabeza de Vaca {{is one of}} {{the most}} important testimonies about the discovery and conquest of the New World. The first half of the 16 th century saw many exploration and conquest travels in which thousands of sailors, explorers, conquerors and soldiers had to face the reality of the just discovered continent. It is really interesting to see how those who wrote about this event experienced it. Naufragios has always been read as a source of historical and anthropological information, but it has been also studied for the literature elements which we can find in it. In my thesis, I tried to look at the work in its complexity: see the literature influences in it and find those elements that we could call literature elements, but also I wanted to focus on the unusual experience of the author and look into the testimony of his experience with the American reality and see how this <b>experience</b> <b>changed</b> him. <b>My</b> thesis begins with a historical introduction which I consider very important to situate the work in its context.

My second serious relationship was ending, and I was feeling very confined and conflicted. I needed to get some space, so I went out to the Mojave desert for a three-day camping weekend with two friends. On the Friday, I hiked up a mountain alone. I knew nothing about meditation or spiritual practice. I was just sitting there, thinking about my life and the things going on. I felt I had gotten pretty screwed up for such a young age.I could see my VW camper, my home for the weekend, parked a few miles away, [...] But at the same time, I was aware that my home was back in Long Beach, California.

40|$|This {{research}} {{arose from}} <b>my</b> curiosity about <b>change,</b> and <b>my</b> dissatisfaction with models and tools {{which do not}} explain my real life, messy, and sometimes disappointing, experiences of trying to instigate <b>change.</b> <b>My</b> aim, therefore, has been to explore {{what is it like}} to experience and make sense of change as it is happening in my working life as a Nurse Practitioner and Primary Care Trust Board member, in primary health care in the National Health Service. Essentially I argue that the dominant way of thinking about change assumes it is a "thing" to be planned and then applied. I believe the error is in thinking we can produce change as if we are in control of a system. An alternative way of thinking about <b>change</b> arising from <b>my</b> <b>experiences</b> is that it can only express our intention for the future but is not controllable in the way often implied. I also suggest <b>change</b> is <b>experienced</b> as movement in the present where, often with hindsight, we experience a shift in patterns of how we speak about or experience something. Early on, my search was for a way of explaining <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>change</b> by initially drawing on the theories of complexity, which point to emergent pattern which arises spontaneously from local interaction, without any external blueprint or plan. I then turn to the theory of complex responsive processes of human relating (Stacey et al, 2000) which views human interaction as itself inherently pattern forming and therefore ordinary everyday interaction as the source of change. I take the theory of complex responsive processes as the foundational theory for my research by asking "What is it like to <b>experience</b> <b>change</b> in primary health care from a complex responsive processes perspective? " My methodology, which is consistent with this perspective, focuses on my own experiences, as emergent exploration of experience (Stacey and Griffin, 2005). In other words I am reflexively exploring my own experience by using narratives, stories and analysis intertwined, to reflect as closely as possible the messy reality of the way we are continuously making sense of <b>experience</b> and <b>change.</b> <b>My</b> <b>experience</b> seeing patients in primary health care; managing a nursing team; and sitting on the Board of a Primary Care Trust highlights the emotional, fantasy laden aspects of experience which are often disregarded or viewed as common knowledge. Similarly, there are feelings of anxiety surrounding any <b>change</b> where <b>my</b> identity feels threatened and there are changes in power relating between people (Elias, 1939). I argue that tools, models and labels serve to relieve feelings of anxiety, by providing an illusion of control, but may in themselves also increase anxiety and block the potential for change. During the research, my own practice has changed by becoming more reflexive as I focus on my own participation, whilst adding further dimensions to the theory. Firstly, I argue that focusing attention in this way implies a heightened awareness of responsibility and potential for one's own actions. I cannot know the result of my actions but know that they may have some effect, large or small. Secondly, I argue that the dominant discourse may perpetuate the way change is viewed as a "thing" external to every day experience. Rather than focusing on control, process thinking conveys a different reality of continuous sensemaking. Lastly, I argue that focusing attention on feelings, emotions and the environment as simultaneous rather than separate aspects of experience becomes important when experiencing and making sense of change from this perspective. I argue, therefore, that a complex responsive processes perspective challenges the dominant perspective on change by providing a way of understanding which resonates with my experiences, has significant implications for my own practice, and validates paying attention to ordinary everyday <b>experience</b> in which <b>change</b> is continually emerging...|$|R
40|$|This Quests {{topic is}} an area that I have spent most of my {{professional}} life examining, and one that, in the great ironies of the Universe, I am now living. As a masters student, I was studying Special Education, when I got the chance to work as a teacher on one of the first Javits grants. From 1992 - 1994, I had the honor of working with Drs. Elizabeth Nielsen and Dennis Higgins in Albuquerque, New Mexico on their Twice-Exceptional Child Project focusing on children with learning disabilities. It was an <b>experience</b> that <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> life. For the first time, I found myself teaching students who confounded me at every corner. Francisco was a 10 -year old student who could tell me jokes about the first Gulf War. Miss Hughes, do you think that if Kuwait imported broccoli, we would be in this war? He was fascinated with rockets and if he could have gotten the proper fuel, would have built a working model in his garage. Yet, Francisco not only couldnt read, he didnt even know his letters. He acted out in class and threw chairs when he was angry. I learned about the Orton-Gillingham method, intensive phonetics, direct instruction, behavior modification, and many other special education terms and curricular approaches. I was so fascinated with this topic that I got my masters degree in both Learning Disabilities and Gifted, and my Ph. D. with concentrations in both Special Education and Gifted Education. I chose the College of William and Mary because of the dual program and Joyce VanTassel-Baskas work with gifted children in poverty. For I had grown up in poverty in rural southwestern Colorado.
