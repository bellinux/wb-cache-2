25|$|In 1961 the <b>drillship</b> Cuss 1 {{was fitted}} with four {{steerable}} propellers, {{in an attempt}} to drill the first Moho well. It was possible to keep the ship in position above the well off La Jolla, California, at a depth of 948 meters.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, it was {{reported}} that Sevmorput would be converted into the world's first nuclear-powered <b>drillship</b> due to lack of demand for cargo operators for lighters and the need of specialized drilling vessels in the Russian Arctic. The conversion at the Zvezdochka plant in Severodvinsk was to take only 18 months. However, the renovation project was revoked in February 2008.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011, Shell Oil Company {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Arctia Offshore and chartered the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to serve as primary ice management vessels in the Chukchi Sea during the summer seasons. The primary purpose of Fennica would be to protect the <b>drillship</b> Noble Discoverer by steering large ice floes so that they don't endanger the drilling operation. The decision to charter the Finnish icebreakers to support Arctic offshore drilling has been widely criticized due potential environmental damage in case of oil spill. On 16 March 2012, some 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard to protest Shell's drilling operations in Alaska.|$|E

25|$|Tiwari was lead {{counsel in}} three major public inquiries: the 1978 {{inquiry into the}} {{explosion}} and fire aboard the Greek tanker S.T. Spyros that killed 76 people; the 1984 commission of inquiry into the collision of the <b>drillship</b> Eniwetok into the Sentosa cableway, causing the deaths of seven people when two cable-cars fell into the ocean; and the inquiry into the collapse of Hotel New World in 1988. As Deputy Senior State Counsel, he also represented the state {{in a number of}} important cases. In 1985, he successfully argued before Justice T. S. Sinnathuray in the High Court that since the Military Court of Appeal was a superior court of record, its jurisdiction and the exercise of its powers to hear appeals from subordinate military courts could not be challenged in the High Court by way of judicial review. He also acted for the Government in the 1988 habeas corpus applications of persons detained under the Internal Security Act during Operation Spectrum before the High Court in De Souza Kevin Desmond v. Minister for Home Affairs and Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs, and in the appeal from those judgments to the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs. In the latter case, the Court of Appeal held in a landmark decision that the executive's decision to detain a person under the Act on national security grounds was reviewable by the courts. The effect of this decision was legislatively reversed in 1989, and Tiwari also represented the Government in challenges to the legality of the amending legislation in the case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs.|$|E
500|$|Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{had long}} been {{interested}} in finding Titanic. Despite early negotiations with possible backers being abandoned when it emerged {{that they wanted to}} turn the wreck into souvenir paperweights, more sympathetic backers joined Ballard to form a company named Seasonics International Ltd. as a vehicle for rediscovering and exploring Titanic. In October 1977 he made his first attempt to find the ship with the aid of the Alcoa Corporation's deep sea salvage vessel Seaprobe. This was essentially a <b>drillship</b> with sonar equipment and cameras attached {{to the end of the}} drilling pipe. It could lift objects from the seabed using a remote-controlled mechanical claw. The expedition ended in failure when the drilling pipe broke, sending [...] of pipe and $600,000 worth of electronics plunging to the sea bed.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{purchase}} of an offshore lease in 2005, Shell initiated its US$4.5billion Arctic drilling program in 2006, after the corporation purchased the [...] "Kulluk" [...] oil rig and leased the Noble Discoverer <b>drillship.</b> At inception, the project was led by Pete Slaiby, a Shell executive who had previously worked in the North Sea. However, after {{the purchase}} of a second offshore lease in 2008, Shell only commenced drilling work in 2012, due to the refurbishment of rigs, permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits. The plans to drill in the Arctic led to protests from environmental groups, particularly Greenpeace; furthermore, analysts in the energy field, as well as related industries, also expressed skepticism due to perceptions that drilling in the region is [...] "too dangerous because of harsh conditions and remote locations".|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Canadian Marine Drilling Ltd., a {{subsidiary}} of Dome Petroleum, brought a small armada to the Beaufort. It included three reinforced <b>drillships</b> and a support fleet of four supply boats, work and supply barges and a tugboat. This equipment expanded the explorable regions in the Beaufort Sea. <b>Drillships,</b> however, had their limitations for Beaufort work. Icebreakers {{and other forms of}} ice management could generally conquer the difficulties of the melting icecap in the summer. But after freeze-up began, the growing icecap would push the drill ship off location if it did not use icebreakers to keep the ice under control. CanMar's fleet eventually grew to include 5 <b>drillships,</b> the SSDC (Single Steel Drilling Caisson) and the Canmar Kigoriak, an Arctic Class 4 Icebreaker.|$|R

50|$|In 1961 Global Marine {{started a}} new <b>drillship</b> era. They ordered several {{self-propelled}} drillships each with a rated centerline drilling of 20,000 foot-wells in water depths of 600 feet. The first was named CUSS (Glomar) II, a 5,500-deadweight-ton vessel, Costing around $4.5 million. Built by a Gulf Coast shipyard, the vessel was almost {{twice the size of}} the CUSS I, and became the world’s first <b>drillship</b> built as new construction which set sail in 1962.|$|E
50|$|Drillships {{have the}} {{functional}} ability of semi-submersible drilling rigs and {{also have a}} few unique features that separate them from all others. First being the ship-shaped design. A <b>drillship</b> has greater mobility and can move quickly under its own propulsion from drill site to drill site in contrast to semi-submersibles and jackup barges and platforms. Drillships {{have the ability to}} save time sailing between oilfields worldwide. A <b>drillship</b> takes 20 days to move from the Gulf of Mexico to the Offshore Angola. Whereas, a semi-submersible drilling unit must be towed and takes 70 days.Drillship construction cost is much higher than that of a semi-submersible. But although mobility comes at a high price, the <b>drillship</b> owners can charge higher day rates and get the benefit of lower idle times between assignments.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{well was}} drilled in 1991, with Sonat's Discoverer Seven Seas <b>drillship,</b> on Mississippi Canyon block 854. Construction was finished in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The company {{owns and}} {{operates}} 4 ultra-deepwater <b>drillships</b> (including 2 under construction), 2 ultra-deepwater semisubmersibles (can drill in water up to 12,000' deep), 2 deepwater semisubmersibles, and 5 high-specification jackup rigs.|$|R
25|$|In the autumn, the Canmar icebreakers {{would return}} to {{continue}} ice management around the <b>drillships</b> until ice would become too thick for the mooring systems. By the end of November, the <b>drillships</b> would be escorted back for winter lay-up and Robert LeMeur would carry out final supply runs to the drilling islands. Although the vessel would typically be laid up for winter in mid-December, she was capable of continuing supply operations through the winter. In some years, Robert LeMeur was involved {{in research and development}} projects during the winter months or drydocked on Canmar's floating dock for inspection and repairs.|$|R
50|$|There are {{basically}} {{two kinds of}} mobile deepwater drilling rigs: semi-submersible drilling rigs and <b>drillships.</b> Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar platform (or tension-leg platform).|$|R
