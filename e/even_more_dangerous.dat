Meanwhile, Silik (John Fleck), the leader of the Suliban Cabal, had boarded Enterprise and manages to steal a shuttlepod to fly to Earth. Tucker and Mayweather are then sent to find Silik along with the shuttlepod. Archer contacts Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) using a stolen communicator and is transported back to Enterprise. Before dying, Daniels asks Archer to stop the Na'Kuhl from using the conduit and becoming <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous.</b> On Earth, the away team find and destroy the shuttlepod, but are captured and taken in for interrogation.|$|E

In {{the case of}} benzodiazepines, {{not only do they}} have additive effects, barbiturates also increase the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine binding site, leading to exaggerated benzodiazepine effects. (ex. If a benzodiazepine increases the frequency of channel opening by 300%, and a barbiturate increases the duration of their opening by 300%, then the combined effects of the drugs increase the channels overall function by 900%, not 600%).|$|E

25|$|The Siberian Traps had unusual {{features}} {{that made them}} <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous.</b> Pure flood basalts produce fluid, low-viscosity lava and do not hurl debris into the atmosphere.

However, Alaskan king crab fishing is considered <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> than the average commercial fishing job, due to the conditions on the Bering Sea during the seasons they fish for crab. According to the pilot episode, the death rate during the main crab seasons averages out to nearly one fisherman per week, while the injury rate for crews on most crab boats is nearly 100% due to the severe weather conditions (frigid gales, rogue waves, ice formations on and around the boat) and the danger of working with such heavy machinery on a constantly rolling boat deck. Alaskan king crab fishing reported over 300 fatalities per 100,000 as of 2005, with over 80% of those deaths caused by drowning or hypothermia.|$|E
