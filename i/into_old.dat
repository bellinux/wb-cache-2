5|$|Haakon {{also had}} the popular {{religious}} text Visio Tnugdali translated <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> Norse as Duggals leiðsla. The literature also appealed to women, and both Haakon's wife Margrete and his daughter Kristina owned richly illustrated psalters.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of {{the myths}} recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> French. However, de Troyes {{was not alone in}} making use of Ovid's material. Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his {{unfinished}} work The Legend of Good Women and briefly alluded to the myth in his Troilus and Criseyde. John Gower included the tale in his Confessio Amantis. References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova, ars subtilior, and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.|$|E

5|$|Kogălniceanu {{was educated}} at Trei Ierarhi monastery in Iași, before being tutored by Gherman Vida, a monk {{who belonged to}} the Transylvanian School, and who was an {{associate}} of Gheorghe Șincai. He completed his primary education in Miroslava, where he attended the Cuénim boarding school. It was during this early period that he first met the poet Vasile Alecsandri (they studied under both Vida and Cuénim), Costache Negri and Cuza. At the time, Kogălniceanu became a passionate student of history, beginning his investigations <b>into</b> <b>old</b> Moldavian chronicles.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Plegmund except that he was of Mercian descent. A later tradition, dating 300 years after his death, stated that Plegmund lived as a hermit at Plemstall in Cheshire. His {{reputation}} as a scholar {{attracted the attention of}} King Alfred the Great, who was trying to revive scholarship. Some time before 887, Alfred summoned Plegmund to his court. There he worked with three other scholars, Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester, Æthelstan and Wærwulf in working on translating Pope Gregory the Great's treatise Pastoral Care <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> English.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{language}} has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries, and is divided by linguists <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> Irish from the 6th to 10th century, Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland {{for most of}} those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{indicate}} the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village {{from at least}} the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating {{the existence of the}} Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> House Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants of these families continue to live in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist. The naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region, including East Worldham, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789).|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{challenged}} {{herself in}} the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which became the focus of her career in later life. She remained active <b>into</b> <b>old</b> age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.|$|E

5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> World and New World lineages.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E
5|$|The Voortrekkers faced {{competition}} for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a recent offshoot from the Zulu Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger {{took part in the}} Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter's laager, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well <b>into</b> <b>old</b> age.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark for {{the emergence of a new}} Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E
5|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{began in}} the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, the Welsh metal mines {{declined}} and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up to half the workers in the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15–20% by 1850. At the peak of the Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work <b>into</b> <b>old</b> age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, Scully {{correctly}} deduces that Arlen was {{blinded by}} reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen <b>into</b> <b>old</b> bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks {{in dire need}} of medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the creature approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased creature then turns into Stites.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Gorman alleges, Kelly {{was looking}} after the daughter, Alice, both {{during and after}} the raid. Gorman asserts that at first Kelly was content to hide the child, but then she, along with her friends Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman and Elizabeth Stride, decided to {{blackmail}} the government. Gorman accuses Salisbury of conspiring with his fellow freemasons, including senior policemen in the London Metropolitan Police, to stop the scandal by staging the murders of the women. Gorman says Salisbury assigned the task to Gull, who lured the four women into a carriage individually where Gull murdered them with the assistance of coachman John Netley and Sir Robert Anderson, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard. Gorman claims a fifth victim, Catherine Eddowes, was killed accidentally in a case of mistaken identity because she used the alias Mary Ann Kelly and was confused with Mary Jane Kelly. Gorman alleges that Netley tried to kill the young Alice twice but after the second unsuccessful attempt several witnesses chased Netley, who threw himself into the Thames and drowned. Gorman completes the story by saying that Alice lived well <b>into</b> <b>old</b> age, later becoming Walter Sickert's mistress, and that Alice and Walter Sickert are his parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} the English Benedictine reform were Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester (963–984), and Oswald, Archbishop of York (971–992). Dunstan and Æthelwold reached {{maturity}} in Æthelstan's cosmopolitan, intellectual court in the 930s, where they met monks from the European reformed houses which provided {{the inspiration for the}} English movement. In the early 940s Dunstan was appointed Abbot of Glastonbury, where he was joined by Æthelwold, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform. The Rule of Saint Benedict was translated <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> English at this time, probably by Æthelwold, and it is the only surviving prose translation of the Rule into a European vernacular in the early Middle Ages. In about 954 Æthelwold wished to go to the Continent to study reforms there at first hand, but King Eadred (946–955) refused him permission and appointed him Abbot of Abingdon, which became the second centre. Dunstan was exiled by King Eadwig (955–959) between 956 and 958, and he spent this time observing Benedictine practices at St Peter's Abbey in Ghent. Æthelwold on the other hand appears to have been on good terms with Eadwig, an early indication that the reformers were not united politically. Oswald was a nephew of Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury from 941 to 958. Oda, a supporter of reform, introduced Oswald to Fleury, where he was ordained and spent {{a large part of the}} 950s.|$|E
5|$|Under Haakon's rule, medieval Norway is {{considered}} to have reached its zenith or golden age. His reputation and formidable naval fleet allowed him to maintain friendships with both the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, despite their conflict. He was at different points offered the Imperial Crown by the Pope, the Irish High Kingship by a delegation of Irish kings, and the command of the French crusader fleet by the French king. He amplified the influence of European culture in Norway by importing and translating contemporary European literature <b>into</b> <b>Old</b> Norse, and by constructing monumental European-style stone buildings. In conjunction with this he employed an active and aggressive foreign policy, {{and at the end}} of his rule added Iceland and the Norse Greenland community to his kingdom, leaving Norway at its territorial height. Although he for the moment managed to secure Norwegian control of the islands off the northern and western shores of Great Britain, he fell ill and died when wintering in Orkney following some military engagements with the expanding Scottish kingdom.|$|E
