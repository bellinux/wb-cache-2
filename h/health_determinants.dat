5000|$|Population {{health has}} been defined as"the health {{outcomes}} {{of a group of}} individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group". It is an approach to health that aims to improve the health of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are [...] "health outcomes, patterns of <b>health</b> <b>determinants,</b> and policies and interventions". [...] A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the social determinants of health, SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations. The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream medicine. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of public health agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries. [...] In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Landmines {{injuries}} {{are considered a}} major public health issue. Cambodia is the 4 th most land mined country in the world. Landmine accident survivors face challenges with poverty and pain, with little chance of improving their lives on their own. Trauma Care Foundation Cambodia started with community based self-help groups in 2000. The aim is to study was to evaluate the impact of self- help group on <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> in mine accident survivors and war victims. 								 Method: Pre- and post-intervention interviews, about different <b>health</b> <b>determinants,</b> were conducted on 91 self-help group members, all participating between 2 and 8 years, from Battambang and Pailin provinces in Cambodia. The main denominator of these <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> was poverty, including underlying factors for poverty. This pretest-posttest assessment of changes in <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> and following participation in SHG has been conducted using non-parametric statistical analyses. 					 Results: Statistical significant improvement was detected in <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> such as; housing standard (p=<. 001), total income sources (p=<. 001), total number of animal species (p=<. 001), months with lack of food (p=. 011), total social participation (p=<. 001), socioeconomic position (p=<. 001). No significant change was detected in <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> such as hectares of farming area (p=. 399). 						 Conclusion: A correlation between SHG and improvement in <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> seems likely. Further research with a more direct focus on health, including all self- help group members, not only the mine accident survivors, with a control group with individuals from the same districts, with and without landmine injuries, might substantiate a causality between the self-help groups and the improvements in <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> and health.

40|$|From 1990 - 2010, {{worldwide}} {{child mortality}} declined by 43 %, and maternal mortality declined by 40 %. This paper compares two sources of progress: improvements in societal coverage of <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> versus {{improvements in the}} impact of <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> {{as a result of}} technical change. This paper decomposes the progress made by 146 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in lowering childhood and maternal mortality into one component due to better <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> like literacy, income, and health coverage and a second component due to changes in the impact of these <b>health</b> <b>determinants.</b> <b>Health</b> <b>determinants</b> were selected from eight distinct health-impacting sectors. <b>Health</b> <b>determinants</b> were selected from eight distinct health-impacting sectors. Regression models are used to estimate impact size in 1990 and again in 2010. Changes in the levels of <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> were measured using secondary data. The model shows that respectively 100 % and 89 % of the reductions in maternal and child mortality since 1990 were due to improvements in nationwide coverage of <b>health</b> <b>determinants.</b> The relative share of overall improvement attributable to any single determinant varies by country and by model specification. However, in aggregate, approximately 50 % of the mortality reductions were due to improvements in the health sector, and the other 50 % of the mortality reductions were due to gains outside the health sector. Overall, countries improved maternal and child health (MCH) from 1990 to 2010 mainly through improvements in the societal coverage of a broad array of health system, social, economic and environmental determinants of child health. These findings vindicate efforts by the global community to obtain such improvements, and align with the post- 2015 development agenda that builds on the lessons from the MDGs and highlights the importance of promoting health and sustainable development in a more integrated manner across sectors...|$|E
40|$|Some <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> require {{relatively}} stronger {{health system}} capacity and socioeconomic development {{than others to}} impact child mortality. Few quantitative analyses have analyzed how the impact of <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> varies by mortality level. 149 low- and middle-income countries were stratified into high, moderate, low, and very low baseline levels of child mortality in 1990. Data for 52 <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> were collected for these countries for 1980 - 2010. To quantify how changes in <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> were associated with mortality decline, univariable and multivariable regression models were constructed. An advanced statistical technique that is new for child mortality analyses-MM-estimation with first differences and country clustering-controlled for outliers, fixed effects, and variation across decades. Some <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> (immunizations, education) were consistently associated with child mortality reduction across all mortality levels.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES—(1) To {{identify}} and to categorise the various city indicators {{that are related}} to health levels; (2) to demonstrate the extent of the influence on health of these categorised health determinants; and (3) to demonstrate both the interactive associations among the <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> and the magnitude of influence of each health determinant on the people's health.  DESIGN—By using city statistics of study areas, the health index and health determinant indices were formulated. The extent of influence of <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> on the health index was examined by regression analysis; the interrelations between the <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> and the health index were examined by correlation analysis.  SETTING—All the administrative units in Japan with populations more than 100   000 were selected as study areas to analyse the relation of health and <b>health</b> <b>determinants.</b>  MAIN RESULTS—The nine health determinant indices used—healthcare resources, preventive health activities, environmental quality, housing, urban clutter, local economy, employment, income, and education—explained 51. 6 % of the variances of the health index as a whole in the cities studies. The health determinant indices showed interrelations with each other, in addition to individual health determinant indices having a high correlation with the health level index of the population.  CONCLUSIONS—Both individually and collectively the <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> are closely related to the health status of a population and individual determinants interact with each other. Simultaneous analysis of the interrelations among <b>health</b> <b>determinants</b> and health status would contribute to widen integration oriented perspective in policy interventions based on collaboration between different sectors of society.    Keywords: indicators; health determinants; Healthy Citie...|$|E

40|$|Background: The <b>health</b> <b>determinant</b> model {{indicates}} that certain sociocultural, sociodemographic, environmental, and lifestyle factors influence health status and wellbeing of any population group {{in any given}} nation (Dahlgren & Whitehead, 1991). Previous studies have suggested the need for regional and interregional comparison of health inequalities due to the interaction of these factors. However, few studies have undertaken such investigation, especially among university students in developing countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the health status and lifestyle behaviours by sex and ethnicity among university students in Nigeria. Method: The study was cross sectional. Full time university students were recruited from six universities within three ethnic groups in Nigeria for the study. Data collection was both subjective and objective. The subjective data was based on an anonymous questionnaire, while the objective data involved direct measurements of height in (m) weight in (kg), and blood pressure (mmHg). Ultimately, 1549 responses were valid, while 563 responses were rejected for various reasons including missing data especially sex and ethnicity. The variables examined were, socio-demographic, general health, mental health, cognitive resources and lifestyle behaviours. Descriptive tests, chi-square tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted. Results: Regarding regional characteristics in socioeconomic status, the result indicated sex and ethnicity effects, and irrespective of ethnicity, female students had better monthly income than male students did. The result suggested that students from the Hausa ethnic group reported better monthly income than students from the other ethnic groups. There is evidence that income have a significant effect on <b>health</b> <b>determinant</b> factors. For example, income affects the choice of residential location, ability to pay for health care services, register for gym for physical activity, afford healthy lifestyles, (e. g. eating fruits and vegetables), participate in social activities and maintain positive self- esteem (WHO, 2006; Varela-Mato et al., 2012). With regard to social support, the result indicated sex*ethnicity effects, where female students from the Hausa and Igbo ethnic groups reported better social support than male students, in contrast to the Yoruba ethnic group, where male students reported better social support than females. Students from the Hausa ethnic group saw their GPs more often, had regular medications and had depression more than other ethnic groups. In addition, the result indicated higher prevalence of smoking and the use of psychotic drugs among students from the Hausa ethnic group than other groups. On the other hand, the Yoruba ethnic group had the lowest monthly income, saw their GPs few times and had less frequent medication than the other ethnic groups. In addition, students from the Yoruba ethnic group had low consumption of fruits and are more physically inactive compared to other ethnic groups. Regarding sex characteristics, the study suggested that irrespective of ethnicity female students are less healthy when compared to male students. In addition, significant sex *ethnic interaction effects (P < 0. 001) were observed, in most variables examined in the study, indicating that the students health and lifestyles are both sex and ethnicity dependent. The study suggested that female students from the Hausa ethnic group reported better income and social support, compared to students from the other ethnic groups; however, they also reported regular medication, overweight or obesity, mental health problems, and poor cognitive health than female students from Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups. In addition, the Hausa male students’ preferred smaller female body size compared to male students from the other ethnic groups. On the other hand, Igbo female students had a better cognitive health and preferred small female body size than female students from the other ethnic groups. The Yoruba female students are less overweight or obese, but had the highest preference for big female body size and are the least depressed group in the sample. With regard to male students, the result suggested that Igbo male students had regular medication and depression more than other male groups. They also preferred bigger female body size and had better cognitive health than other male groups. On the other hand, Yoruba males reported overweight or obese, than the other male groups. Conclusion: The findings indicated that the health of female students in the sample was poorer than the health of male students; with female students from the Hausa ethnic group, demonstrating the worst possible health outcome. The result also suggested that both high and low socioeconomic statuses are associated with health compromising behaviours among university students in Nigeria. The findings indicated that high cognitive health appraisal might be related to students reporting better mental health especially depression in both male and female students. This study is the first to report that there is an interaction between the different layers of health, in the <b>health</b> <b>determinant</b> model proposed by Dahlgren and Whitehead (1991). Secondly, this study has made a major contribution to the understanding that people who live among regions with conflict and violence may report poor health (both physical and mental) compared to those that live in a conflict free zones. Consequently, the results of the present study suggest that conflict and violence be included among the <b>health</b> <b>determinant</b> factors in the <b>health</b> <b>determinant</b> model proposed by Dahlgren and Whitehead (1991) ...|$|R
