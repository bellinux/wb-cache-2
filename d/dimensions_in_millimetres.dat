40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} the range of the sizes for the different parts of the cerebral ventricular system. These simple measurements should be applicable to the brain Computed Tomography Scan reading without any need for advanced morphometric software package. Three hundred (150 females and 150 males) normal brain CT scans were obtained from a private Diagnostic Radiology centre in Harare for ventricular dimensions measurements (bifrontal, third ventricular and fourth ventricular dimensions). 18 hydrocephalus patients were also included in the study. A MILLENSYS DICOM Viewer Version 9 Â® USA software program was used to measure ventricular <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>millimetres.</b> This study found an average (MeanÂ±SE) frontal horn diameter, third ventricle width, fourth ventricle width, fourth ventricle height, Frontal Horn ratio (A/B), and the third ventricle ratio (C/D) for the sample being 31. 8 Â± 0. 2 mm, 3. 25 Â± 0. 09 mm, 10. 6 Â± 0. 1 mm, 10. 5 Â± 0. 1, 0. 313 Â± 0. 002, and 0. 030 Â± 0. 002, respectively. Except for the fourth height which was not significantly affected by age (p= 0. 515), the present study showed that there was a significant difference between different age groups on all of the above measurements and ratios (p< 0. 01) Criteria have been developed that are measurable, reproducible and applicable in routine diagnosis of dilated cerebral ventricles in adults. In general, the maximum frontal tips diameter greater than 48...|$|E

50|$|In the United States, several firms {{produced}} {{this kind of}} technical pen: WRICO, Leroy, and Koh-I-Noor. Each had its own proprietary sequence of line widths, meaning that the widths were not standardized across the industry, and each company's specifications for the widths did not match the others. And the specifications were given as fractions of an inch instead of fractions of a millimeter. In the case of technical pens made for the US market, they were marked with both proprietary symbolic expressions (4×0, 3×0, 2×0, 0, 1, 2 etc.) and standard metric <b>dimensions</b> denominated <b>in</b> <b>millimetres.</b>|$|R
40|$|Dental {{implants}} {{are exposed}} to dynamic loading, caused by the masticatory process, with axial and extra-axial forces in a stochastic manner. The material wear {{as a result of}} this fatigue loading has so far been discussed in the literature only by means of its consequences while the causes for the latter remain unknown. Hence, dental implants have been investigated in vitro under load to shed light on the reasons for implant failure. Implants made of titanium are opaque objects with typical <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> the <b>millimetre</b> range: by applying synchrotron-based radiography with high spatial resolution and high contrast one can depict their inner structure in a non-destructive and scale-preserving manner. The implant-abutment system could thus be studied for the very first time in vitro before, during and after loading. Within the frame of this work the existence of a microgap between implant and abutment has been proved. The opening of this gap has been studied under load. The gap width was quantitatively determined by comparing measured and simulated radiographs of the implants...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of uniform-sized nanoparticles has potential application {{in a wide}} variety of fields, but is still a challenge. One main reason that many lab-scale manufactured nanoparticles have not appeared in industry is because there is lack of control on physical properties and surface functionality of nanoparticles during massive production. Recently, a process called 2 ̆ 2 Flash Nanoprecipitation (FNP) 2 ̆ 2 has been developed to produce nanoparticles with controlled size and high drug-loading rate. In FNP, fast mixing is required to make sure that solvent and non-solvent mix homogeneously so that competitive precipitation of organics and polymer could result in functional nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. A multi-inlet vortex reactor (MIVR) has been developed to provide fast mixing for the FNP. The MIVR includes four inlets which are tangential to the mixing chamber of reactor. The MIVR has the operational advantage of providing different inlet-flow momentum and configurations compared to other reactors used in the FNP such as confined impinging jet reactor (CIJR). Former studies have already shown its ability of providing fast mixing and successfully producing functional nanoparticles in the FNP. However, until now all previous investigations about the MIVR only focused <b>in</b> its micro-scale (<b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>millimetre).</b> While the micro-scale MIVR does show great promise in the {{production of}} functional nanoparticles, the small dimensions and correspondingly small output of the micro-scale MIVR limit its usefulness to producing functional nanopraticles for applications requiring small production run such as high-value pharmaceutical agents. Some applications such as nanoparticle used in pesticides and cosmetics may require larger production run than the micro-scale MIVR can provide, making it economically unrealistic based on the relatively high capital and operating costs needed for a large number of reactors operating in parallel. For this reason, in the study we are interested in investigating the feasibility of scaling up the FNP process to a macro-scale MIVR capable of generating large quantities of functional nanoparticles, both rapidly and economically, and consequently developing experimentally verified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models that can be used as design tools for further optimizing reactor design and operation parameters to produce customized functional nanoparticles. To accomplish this investigation, a macro-scale MIVR has been built with optical access. Non-intrusive, optical-based measurement techniques including particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) were used to measure flow field and mixing, and related CFD models, specifically turbulence models were validated and developed for optimizing the MIVR and future model development of the FNP process...|$|R
40|$|Hot-embossing is an {{economical}} {{manufacturing process}} for the structuring of glass. For structures with <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> the <b>millimetre</b> and micrometre range and high aspect ratios {{it is necessary to}} work under isothermal process conditions. In order to prevent the sticking of the glass to the tool, the glass substrates were coated with thin metal, carbon and oxide layers were applied on the glass substrate. The layers were examined with respect to their behaviour change and suitability for the embossing process. All layers showed a clear reduction of the adhesive forces and a shift of the sticking temperature to higher temperature ranges. Some layers led even to the abolition of any sticking in the entire viscosity range relevant for the hot-embossing of glass. The examined layers behave ductile with small strains; however, under larger elongations tend to cracking. Fluidic demonstration structures were realized and hot-embossed successfully in float glass. The lateral design geometries of the channels and chambers lay between 10 µm and 2 mm with embossing depths up to 2 mm. The largest aspect ratio of embossing depth to structural width amounted to 3. The attainable accuracies and surface qualities correspond thereby to that of the used mould insert. The results of the research show the extraordinary potential of the new coating strategy for the hot-embossing of glass...|$|R
