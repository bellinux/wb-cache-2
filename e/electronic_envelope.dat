The model of ball lightning is offered, which exterior <b>electronic</b> <b>envelope</b> is retained by interior volumetric positive charge.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electronic}} {{structure of a}} new type of Fibonacci superlattice based on Si delta-doped GaAs. Assuming that delta-doped layers are equally spaced, quasiperiodicity is introduced by selecting two different donor concentrations and arranging them according to the Fibonacci series along the growth direction. The one-electron potential due to delta-doping is obtained by means of the Thomas-Fermi approach. The resulting energy spectrum is then found by solving the corresponding effective-mass wave equation. We find that a self-similar spectrum {{can be seen in the}} band structure. Electronic transport properties of samples are also discussed and related to the degree of spatial localization of <b>electronic</b> <b>envelope</b> functions...|$|E

The basic approach to EELE establishment is investigated in detail. The interrelationship between storage life and working life of electronic equipment is demonstrated by virtue of EELE, which validates its preliminary application and advantages. The new philosophy can be further applied to accelerated experiments and service life prediction for electronic equipments...|$|R
40|$|In {{procurement}} system, either paper-based or electronic, {{the seller}} should submit documents to the buyer. The documents are usually restricted and confidential, containing information that {{should only be}} read by purchasing committee, never be read by any other parties, especially the competitors. Therefore special treatment to hide the confidentialily should {{be applied to the}} documents envelope, so that the system can meet the required information security principles such as authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation. In this paper a method to create <b>electronic</b> secure <b>envelope</b> containing e-procurement submission document is proposed. Assymmetric Cryptosystem using RSA algorithm is used to develop a document submission system. Before the submission process, the seller should authenticate himself using his private key. Documents to be submitted will be compressed with a random session/envelope key. The session key will be sealed with both private key of the selles and the public key of purchasing committee so that anyone else can not decrypt the compressed envelope. Only the seller (owner of the documents) and the purchasing committee can decrypt the encrypted documents. The submission process is performed using upload capability of hyper-text transmission protocol (HTTP) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{theoretical}} electronic structure of Fibonacci superlattices of narrow-gap III-V semiconductors. The electron dynamics is accurately described within the envelope-function approximation in a two-band model. Quasiperiodicity is introduced by considering two different Ill-V semiconductor layers and arranging {{them according to}} the Fibonacci series along the growth direction. The resulting energy spectrum is then found by solving exactly the corresponding effective-mass (Dirac-like) wave equation using tranfer-matrix techniques. We find that a self-similar electronic spectrum {{can be seen in}} the band structure. Electronic transport properties of samples are also studied and related to the degree of spatial localization of <b>electronic</b> <b>envelope</b> functions via the Landauer resistance and Lyapunov coefficient. As a working example, we consider type II InAs/GaSb superlattices and discuss in detail our results in this system...|$|E
40|$|Modelling of {{electron}} {{states in}} quantum-wire systems- influence of stochastic {{effects on the}} confining potential Mikhail Vladimirovich Deryabin and Morten Willatzen Abstract—In this work, we address theoretically the influence of red and white Gaussian noise for electronic energies and eigenstates of cylindrically shaped quantum dots. The stochastic effect can be imagined as resulting from crystal-growth statistical fluctuations in the quantum-dot material composition. In particular we obtain analytical expressions for the eigenvalue shifts and <b>electronic</b> <b>envelope</b> functions in the k · p formalism due to stochastic variations in the confining band-edge potential. It is shown that white noise in the band-edge potential leaves electronic properties almost unaffected while red noise may lead to changes in state energies and envelopefunction amplitudes of several percentages. In the latter case, the ensemble-averaged envelope function decays {{as a function of}} distance. It is also shown that, in a stochastic system, constant ensembleaveraged envelope functions are the only bounded solutions for the infinite quantum-wire problem and the energy spectrum is completely discrete. In other words, the infinite stochastic quantum wire behaves, ensemble-averaged, as an atom. Keywords—cylindrical quantum dots, electronic eigenenergies, red and white Gaussian noise, ensemble averaging effects. I...|$|E
40|$|Emission {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used {{for the first time in}} a spectroscopic study of a family of uranium(IV) halide complexes in non-aqueous media. The room temperature electronic absorption spectra of the simple coordination compounds [Li(THF) (4) ][UX 5 (THF) ] (X = Cl, Br, I), [Et 4 N](2) [UCl 6] and UCl 4 in THF have been recorded and all transitions assigned with the aid of a comprehensive computational study using CASSCF and CASPT 2 techniques. Excitation into a band of f-d and LMCT character followed by energy transfer into the 5 f-orbital manifold accounts for the UV-visible radiative transitions observed in the emission spectra, which have been fully assigned as arising from transitions from the 5 f(1) 6 d(1) <b>electronic</b> configuration to <b>envelopes</b> of states arising from the ground state 5 f(2) configuration. The bonding in [Li(THF) (4) ][UCl 5 (THF) ] has been further elucidated utilising NBO and AIM calculations which describe the nature of the U-Cl bond as predominantly ionic with some dative covalent character and substantial overlap between the Cl 3 p orbitals and 5 f and 6 d orbitals on uranium. These studies indicate that the emission spectral fingerprint of simple U(IV) compounds of O-h, C- 4 v and C- 2 v symmetry are similar and characteristic and may be used as a diagnostic tool to assign U(IV) species in solution and by inference, in the environment, in the presence of [UO 2](2 +) ...|$|R
