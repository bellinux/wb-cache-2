50|$|The second main type of {{concrete}} pump is either {{mounted on a}} truck or placed on a trailer, and it is {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> or trailer-mounted concrete pump. This pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine. Those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed. <b>Line</b> <b>pumps</b> normally pump concrete at lower volumes than boom pumps and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming pools, sidewalks, and single family home concrete slabs and most ground slabs.|$|R
40|$|The dental {{neonatal}} {{line of the}} {{sika deer}} (Cervus nippon) was identified experimentally using chronological labeling methods. In the <b>enamel,</b> prominent dark <b>lines</b> were observed under transmitted light, {{and the number of}} increments between the dark line and labeling line was almost consistent with the day-age at the time of labeling injection. Therefore, we identified the dark <b>line</b> as the <b>enamel</b> neonatal <b>line.</b> In the dentin, the bright line was observed under polarized light. Since the bright line corresponded to the <b>enamel</b> neonatal <b>line,</b> we recognized the bright line as the dentin neonatal line. Neonatal lines intersected with the enamel-dentin junction at approximately one-third cervical in the first molar. Using these features, it would make possible to distinguish the neonatal line in wild sika deer...|$|R
40|$|Dens invaginatus {{results from}} an infolding {{of the outer}} surface of a tooth. The {{clinical}} importance of dens invaginatus results from the risk of pulpal disease. So, all clinicians {{should be aware of}} this anomaly. The presence of double dens invaginatus is extremely rare. This article presents three cases of double dens invaginatus in permanent maxillary lateral incisors, one with preventive restoration on its palatal surface. They were classified as double dens invaginatus because of two <b>enamel</b> <b>lined</b> invaginations presented in the crowns of these teeth...|$|R

40|$|A mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow {{modeling}} method {{has been developed}} to provide a fast capability for modeling turbopumps of rocket engines. Based on this method, a mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow code PUMPA has been written that can predict the performance of pumps at off-design operating conditions, given {{the loss of the}} diffusion system at the design point. The pump code can model axial flow inducers, mixed-flow and centrifugal pumps. The code can model multistage pumps in series. The code features rapid input setup and computer run time, and is an effective analysis and conceptual design tool. The map generation capability of the code provides the map information needed for interfacing with a rocket engine system modeling code. The off-design and multistage modeling capabilities of the code permit parametric design space exploration of candidate pump configurations and provide pump performance data for engine system evaluation. The PUMPA code has been integrated with the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) code and an expander rocket engine system has been simulated. The mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow code runs {{as an integral part of}} the NPSS rocket engine system simulation and provides key pump performance information directly to the system model at all operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{clinical}} study was to evaluate whether or not an association exists between the presence of <b>enamel</b> craze <b>lines</b> and the prevalence of tooth sensitivity (TS) after in-office bleaching. Subjects that met the inclusion criteria (N = 23) were screened to detect the existence of <b>enamel</b> craze <b>lines.</b> In total, 460 teeth were subjected to bleaching where 49 % of them presented <b>enamel</b> craze <b>lines.</b> After bleaching (15 % hydrogen peroxide), the {{subjects were asked to}} rate the level of TS by answering a self-administered questionnaire. The majority of subjects (91 %) experienced TS at the first day of bleaching. The TS prevalence decreased gradually to 22 % at second day, to 17 % at third day, and to 9 % at fourth day. After the fourth day, no subject reported TS. While 15 % of teeth with craze lines presented TS, 11 % of teeth with no craze lines also showed TS. A positive but weak correlation (r = 0. 214) was found between the existence of <b>enamel</b> craze <b>lines</b> and TS. In this {{clinical study}}, higher incidence of TS was found with the use of 15 % hydrogen peroxide bleaching agent compared to the previous studies. Patients who would undergo in-office bleaching should be informed that tooth sensitivity is a very often side effect but it may disappear within 1 week...|$|R

40|$|The (CH 3 OH) -C- 13 isotopomer of {{methanol}} {{has been}} reinvestigated {{as a source}} of far-infrared (FIR) laser emission by the use of the extended line coverage available from an efficient CO 2 laser recently developed for optical pumping. With this system we have observed 19 new FIR laser <b>Lines,</b> <b>pumped</b> by 11 different CO 2 transitions, with five of the <b>pump</b> <b>lines</b> belonging to the new 9 HP CO 2 hot band. Accurate heterodyne frequency measurements of the FIR laser and the pump offset have been made for 16 FIR laser lines, including three previously reported in the literature. High-resolution Fourier-transform spectroscopic results for the GO-stretching and the CH 3 -rocking infrared fundamentals of (CH 3 OH) -C- 13 have been applied to assign the <b>pump</b> and lasing <b>lines</b> for five of the transition systems.

30|$|Visual {{inspection}} of the Brooklyn Museum’s lamp reveals {{the order in which}} its decorative materials were applied (Fig.  1 d). Thin red <b>enamel</b> <b>lines</b> overlap gilding, while thicker polychrome enamels overlap both gilding and thin red enamel, meaning that the gilding was applied first, followed by the thin red enamel, and finally the thicker polychrome enamels. Close examination of the gilding and identification of a few gold flakes within the colorless glass indicate that the gold was finely ground to less than one micrometer thick and applied in a medium, rather than as gold leaf. Gold particles could be suspended in a medium, such as a mixture of water and gum Arabic or a light oil, and applied to the glass surface with a brush or stylus before firing [26, 27].|$|R
5000|$|The one {{jerrycan}} in American possession {{was sent}} to Camp Holabird, Maryland, where it was redesigned. The new design retained the handles, size and shape. The US can could be stacked interchangeably with German or British cans. The weld was replaced with rolled seams which were prone to leakage. For fuel cans, the lining was removed and a wrench and funnel were required. A similar water can was also adopted, with a flip-top lid and <b>enamel</b> <b>lining.</b> [...] The US designed jerrycan was widely used by US Army and Marine Corps units. In all overseas theaters, fuel and other petroleum products represented about 50% of all supply needs, measured by weight.
