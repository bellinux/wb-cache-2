50|$|A typical {{example is}} a web server log which {{maintains}} a history of page requests. The W3C maintains a standard format (the Common Log Format) for web server log files, but other proprietary formats exist. More recent entries are typically appended {{to the end of}} the file. Information about the request, including client IP address, request date/time, page requested, HTTP code, bytes served, user agent, and referrer are typically added. This data can be combined into a single file, or separated into distinct logs, such as an access log, <b>error</b> <b>log,</b> or referrer log. However, server logs typically do not collect user-specific information.|$|E

50|$|The Electronic Disturbance Theater {{took notice}} {{of these actions}} when others did not and {{arranged}} their first act of electronic civil disobedience against the Mexican Government. In a subsequent version of FloodNet, those who had downloaded the FloodNet program {{in support of the}} Zapatistas were asked to repeatedly input the names of those that had lost their lives {{at the hands of the}} Mexican Army in military attacks. This would then target the servers to return an error message each time these URLs would be requested. This data request would be stored in a server's <b>error</b> <b>log</b> and in the eyes of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Electronic Disturbance Theater group, a symbolic list of those 45 Acteal civilians who had died straight to their murderers. If enough people used the FloodNet applet, this would cause the computer server running the website to overload, so that when a regular visitor or someone working within the site tried to access the website or send company based emails and files, the pages would either load extremely slowly or not at all. This worked on the same basis of a real sit-in demonstration, where the protesters block the entrance to a public building of their oppressors and preventing access to the building.|$|E

Of course no single project can be expected to illuminate all the aspects of software development. But the <b>error</b> <b>log</b> of TEX seems to provide useful data for understanding the problems of crafting a medium-size piece of software. It's hard to teach students the concept of "scale"- the enormous difference between textbook examples and larger systems- but I think that a reasonable appreciation of the complexity of a medium-size project can be acquired by spending about two hours reading through a complete log such as the one in 161.
