5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species.

5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals.

This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, <b>explaining</b> <b>the</b> paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the quaestor Tribonian to oversee this task.
