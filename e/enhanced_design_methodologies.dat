40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to model an <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> applied to the {{conception}} of an innovative product in a SME environment. This approach includes C-K theory in a context of disruptive innovation. In general, the industrial design process consists of four major steps: the egodesign phase where the designer conceptualizes a user need, a techno-design phase where designer and engineer find solutions to materialize the concept, a -design phase where social actors involved authorize it and then the ergodesign phase where the user adopts the final product. A methodological reflection leads to the modelling of the innovative <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> reasoning (where major actors are replaced by a bunch of various stakeholders). The specific SME’s case was successful. Using the model, the <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> project management was efficient. But some more complex application cases would help secure it...|$|R
40|$|The SACRES {{project is}} dealing with the {{development}} of new <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> and associated tools for safety critical embedded systems. Emphasis is put on formal techniques for modular verification of the specifications, distributed code generation, and generated code validation against specifications. This is allowed by using a single formal model which is that of the Dc+ format, which provides a common semantic framework for all tools as well as end user specification formalisms. Modular and distributed code generation is the main subject of this paper. Distributed code generation aims at reducing the dependency of the design with respect to the target architecture. Modularity helps reuse of existing designs, and makes it possible to address much larger systems. 1 Introduction The overall objective of the SACRES project is to provide designers of embedded control systems, in particular safety critical systems, with an <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> supported by a toolset [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> for optimal mixture proportion of concrete composition {{with respect to}} accuracy {{in the case of}} using prediction models based on a limited database. In proposed methodology, the search space is constrained as the domain defined by a limited database instead of constructing the database covering the region represented by the possible ranges of all variables in the input space. A model for defining the search space which is expressed by the effective region in this paper and evaluating whether a mix proportion is effective is added to the optimization process, yielding highly reliable results. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a genetic algorithm, an artificial neural network, and a convex hull were adopted as an optimum technique, a prediction model for material properties, and an evaluation model for the effective region, respectively. And then, it was applied to an optimization problem wherein the minimum cost should be obtained under a given strength requirement. Experimental test results show that the mix proportion obtained from the proposed methodology considering the regional characteristics of the database is found to be more accurate and feasible than that obtained from a general optimum technique that does not consider this aspect. close 3...|$|R

40|$|An <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> for {{minimizing}} the error in on-line Kalman filter-based aircraft engine performance estimation applications {{is presented in}} this paper. It specific-ally addresses the under-determined estimation problem, {{in which there are}} more unknown parameters than available sensor measurements. This work builds upon an existing technique for systematically selecting a model tuning parameter vector of appropriate dimension to enable estimation by a Kalman filter, while {{minimizing the}} estimation error in the parameters of interest. While the existing technique was optimized for open-loop engine operation at a fixed design point, in this paper an alternative formulation is presented that enables the technique to be optimized for an engine operating under closed-loop control throughout the flight envelope. The theoretical Kalman filter mean squared estimation error at a steady-state closed-loop operating point is derived, and the tuner selection approach applied to minimize this error is discussed. A technique for constructing a globally optimal tuning parameter vector, which enables full-envelope application of the technology, is also presented, along with design steps for adjusting the dynamic response of the Kalman filter state estimates. Results from the application of the technique to linear and nonlinear aircraft engine simulations are presented and compared to the conventional approach of tuner selection. The new methodology is shown to yield a significant improvement in on-line Kalman filter estimation accuracy...|$|R

Existing laboratory and bench scale facilities {{are being used to}} generate critical missing data which will be used to improve the NO{sub x} and carbon burnout submodels in comprehensive combustion simulation tools currently being used by industrial boiler manufacturers. ABB/Combustion Engineering is providing needed fundamental data on the extent of volatile evolution from commercial coals as well as background information on current design needs in industrial practice. Since they will ultimately be a recipient of the <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> <b>methodology,</b> they are also providing ongoing review of the practical applicability of the tools being developed.

40|$|Designing an {{industrial}} hypermedia application {{can be extremely}} difficult and complex due to the large volume of information. The aim of this programme is therefore to develop <b>enhanced</b> <b>design</b> and authoring <b>methodologies,</b> while addressing the issues faced by an enterprise when developing a large-scale industrial hypermedia application. The main <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> currently discussed in the literature assume that the authors of a hypermedia application have complete control over {{the content of the}} information space. In addition, no one model covers all the requirements for developing {{an industrial}} hypermedia application. The <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> presented satisfies the requirements found in the industrial environment in a holistic approach. That is, it takes into account the information structures and constraints that exist within the industrial environment, and the background of the people who will have to design and implement the industrial hypermedia system. While the general authoring methodologies address some of the requirements of an industrial environment, the size and complexity of the required system, aggravates some of the problems found in general hypermedia authoring. Hence, an authoring methodology is presented that addresses these issues in relation to the industrial environment. The methodologies have been used to produce a prototype application. This will be used to evaluate the usability of a hypermedia system within the factory environment...|$|R

This, in part, entails developing applications that have interfaces that are well designed. It is therefore important that computer science students gain formal education in <b>design</b> <b>methodology.</b> The best way to teach design is debatable, but one teaching tool gaining popularity in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the use of case studies. We aim to increase the usefulness of the case study as a tool to teach <b>design</b> <b>methodology.</b> A case study is a collection of artifacts and data used to communicate a story. In the field of HCI cases communicate how a designer accomplished designing a certain aspect or, in some cases, the entirety of a design.

Although {{the adoption of}} composites is rising, there are still open issues to be investigated, in particular, understanding their failure mechanism has {{a prominent role in}} <b>enhancing</b> component <b>designs.</b> Numerous <b>methodologies</b> are available to compute accurate stress/strain fields for laminated structures, multi-scale approaches are required when micro- and macro-scales are accounted for. Despite the increasing development in computer hardware, the computational effort of these methods is still prohibitive for extensive applications, especially when a high number of layers is considered. Then, the reduction of the computational time and cost required to perform failure analysis is still a challenging task. This work proposes two multiscale approaches for the failure analysis of fiber-reinforced composites. A concurrent multiscale approach ("Component-Wise") and a hierarchical method are developed based on the 1 D Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). 1 D higher order elements are very powerful tools for multiscale analysis since they provide accurate stress and strain fields with very low computational cost...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is {{a control}} system <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> {{founded on the}} premise that {{feedback}} is necessary only because of system uncertainty. Articulating flexible structures, such as flexible manipulators, present a difficult closed-loop control problem. In such servo systems, the coupling of the rigid and flexible modes and the non-minimum phase dynamics severely limit system stability and performance. The difficulties in controlling these structures is exacerbated by the denumerably infinite number of flexible modes and associated difficulties in developing accurate dynamic models for controller design. As such, the control of articulating flexible structures presents a non-trivial testbed for the design of QFT based robust control systems. This dissertation examines the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) QFT based control of an articulating flexible structure and presents an enhancement of the theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT <b>design</b> <b>methodologies.</b> The control problem under consideration is the active vibration control of an articulating single-link flexible manipulator. This is facilitated by an actuation scheme comprised of a combination of spatially discrete actuation, {{in the form of a}} DC motor to perform articulation, and spatially distributed actuation, in the form of a piezoelectric transducer for active vibration control. In the process of developing and experimentally validating the QFT based control system, shortcomings in the theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> are addressed. Robust stability theorems are developed for the two main MIMO QFT <b>design</b> <b>methodologies,</b> namely the sequential and non-sequential MIMO QFT <b>design</b> <b>methodologies.</b> The theorems complement and extend the existing theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT <b>design</b> <b>methodologies.</b> The dissertation results expose salient features of the MIMO QFT <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> and provide connections to other multivariable <b>design</b> <b>methodologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{engineering}} <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> helps {{designers to}} design {{in a systematic}} way. Based on the findings from a literature review, engineering <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> can be categorised into three types: prescriptive, descriptive and normative. Most established <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> are of the prescriptive type and {{they are based on}} step-oriented models. However, designers in industry are not found to be too keen on using any of these <b>design</b> <b>methodologies.</b> Among the reasons for not adopting these methodologies are that the prescriptive and normative <b>design</b> <b>methodologies</b> were found to be influencing the design strategies and approaches of a designer while the descriptive types were mostly used to study the design process. Though designers have their own design strategies and approaches, they also need design support. The descriptive type will not interfere with the designer’s strategies but they do suffer from a lack of structure in supporting designers. The goal of this research is to derive a <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> framework to support designers without influencing their design approaches and strategies. A descriptive <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> framework to support designers is proposed in this research work. This framework was derived based on four aspects: a descriptive type based on a function-oriented model, the types of support facilities that can be provided, identification of critical design factors as design parameters for the framework and lastly, the adaptation of the Ishikawa fishbone diagram to represent the framework. The novel descriptive <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> was applied in two case studies: the first with an experienced designer without using any design methods and second, with a novice designer adopting a design approach based on the step-oriented model. The second case study included an additional design tool based on TRIZ to verify the effectiveness of the novel descriptive <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> working with other tools. The designers’ feedback and observations from these both case studies showed that the novel descriptive <b>design</b> <b>methodology</b> was able to support designers in many ways. In particular it was able to accommodate different design approaches and strategies without influencing the designer, providing both methodology-related and computational-platform related support facilities as well as working in a complementary way with other design tools.
