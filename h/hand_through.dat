5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating. Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance. Once inside the ambulance, Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> {{a crack in the}} debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E

5|$|When {{the group}} lands in Kuldahar, they {{discover}} {{it has been}} invaded by the Legion of the Chimera. They meet the Archdruid of Kuldahar, who tells them that a portal has been opened to allow yuan-ti from the Jungles of Chult to assault Kuldahar. After the group prevents the attack, the Archdruid tells them that they may reach the Severed <b>Hand</b> <b>through</b> an exit at the bottom floor of the Dragon's Eye. The group travels through Dragon's Eye, and proceeds to the Severed Hand. Once inside, they learn that the war between the Ten Towns and the Legion of the Chimera {{was caused by the}} mayor of Bryn Shander, who had sent Isair and Madae poisoned food. They also discover that a mythal that was cast on the Severed Hand has been corrupted, and the structure will be transported to the plane of limbo. Eventually, the group finds Isair and Madae, and kills them.|$|E

Our method combines efficiently calculated color likelihood maps with {{a modified version}} of the Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) tracker. The proposed algorithm allows to robustly track <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> image sequences and additionally provides accurate hand segmentations per frame. Experimental evaluation proves the high accuracy of the segmentation results and a first application for human-computer interaction is presented. 1...|$|R

25|$|It was {{thanks to}} Culshaw's devotion to Wagnerian {{intentions}} – ever {{encouraged by the}} engineer who was at his right <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the whole project, Gordon Parry, himself a devoted Wagnerian – that in the Solti Ring cycle one is able to hear the scores in a way literally impossible in the theatre.

25|$|The Russian psychic Nina Kulagina came to wide public {{attention}} following {{the publication of}} Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder's best seller, Psychic Discoveries Behind The Iron Curtain. The alleged Soviet psychic of the late 1960s and early 1970s was filmed apparently performing telekinesis while seated in numerous black-and-white short films. She was also mentioned in the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report from 1978. Magicians and skeptics have argued that Kulagina's feats could easily be performed by one practiced in sleight of <b>hand,</b> <b>through</b> means such as cleverly concealed or disguised threads, small pieces of magnetic metal, or mirrors.|$|E

25|$|In their {{research}} {{there were only}} two players who had a significantly lower number of runs than expected by chance. No shooter had significantly more runs than would be expected by chance. About half of the shooters (12 of 23 = 52%) had fewer runs than expected, and about half (11 of 23 = 48%) had more runs than expected. The researchers also compared the shooters hits and misses. The data were more in accordance with chance than the hot <b>hand.</b> <b>Through</b> their analysis of the data the conclusion was drawn that there was nothing that supported the hot hand hypothesis.|$|E

The Federal's guns had to be pulled by <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> swamp over moveable tram sections, the men working in brackish alligator-infested marsh, sinking in over their waist most of the day. The artillery then had to be placed on board-and-bag platforms to avoid their loss by sinking into the morass. The soldiers rested during the day.|$|E
25|$|Guizot's view of {{politics}} was essentially historical and philosophical. His tastes and his acquirements gave him little {{insight into the}} practical business of administrative government. Of finance he knew nothing; trade and commerce were strange to him; military and naval affairs were unfamiliar to him; all these subjects he dealt with by second <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> his friends, Pierre Sylvain Dumon (1797–1870), Charles Marie Tanneguy, Comte Duchâttel (1803–1867), or Marshal Bugeaud. The consequence was that few measures of practical improvement were carried by his administration. Still less did the government lend an ear to the cry for parliamentary reform.|$|E

Carter (1979), (where it effectively gave the Presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress or the Senate). The Court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority, as in Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935), the Steel Seizure Case (1952), and United States v. Nixon (1974).|$|E
25|$|Seishirō {{encounters}} Subaru for {{one final}} {{fight in the}} Rainbow Bridge. After some time of fighting, Seishirō heads in for the finishing blow. Hokuto's final spell takes effect, leaving Subaru with his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> Seishirō's chest, killing the Sakurazukamori instead. Hokuto's final wish was Subaru could not be killed {{the same way she}} was. Seishirō knew this, effectively committing suicide as Fūma states Subaru's wish was dying at Seishirō's hands. After the battle, Fūma offers Subaru Seishirō's remaining intact eye, revealing that it was Seishirō's wish to erase Fūma's trace on Subaru, which Subaru accepts. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the 14th Sakurazukamori and one of the Dragons of Earth. A sidestory in the series also shows Seishiro becoming the Sakurazukamori by killing his mother who tells him he will also be killed by the person he loves.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 {{there were}} 13 state {{contests}} before Super Tuesday, seven caucuses and 5 primaries. Missouri had a nonbinding straw poll {{in the form}} of a primary. Santorum spent months in Iowa, traveling to all 99 counties and holding some 381 town hall meetings. This one state campaign succeeded when he tied with Romney in the Iowa Caucuses on January 3. This first in the nation caucus propelled him into a national campaign while it ended Michele Bachmann's campaign. On the night of the caucuses, Romney was reported the winner of Iowa by only eight votes over Santorum, but after the results were certified, Santorum was declared the winner, beating Romney by 34 votes, despite the results from 8 districts being lost. Newt Gingrich said after Iowa that his positive campaign had been a weakness, and had allowed his rivals to gain the upper <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> negative attacks paid by super PACs supporting them.|$|E
