5|$|On April 16, 2010, the {{day prior}} to the annual Vaisakhi Parade held in Surrey, B.C., one of the parade {{organizers}} issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the parade, their safety could not be guaranteed. This was {{due in part to}} comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T-shirts, a terrorist organization that is banned in India, Britain, the United States, and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} her son Kwame was very ill. The {{following}} month, Queen Elizabeth II made her {{first visit to}} Ghana. While inspecting the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and President Nkrumah passed by the boy's bed. Since he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his parents displayed on his bedside table, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had visited Kumasi previously and had met Peggy Appiah, turned back, as he was leaving, to send his regards. President Nkrumah's reported anger at being embarrassed in this way -this was the husband of a foreign head of state sending a greeting to {{the wife of a}} man Nkrumah had in political detention – was reportedly {{one of the reasons that}} Kwame Appiah's doctor was deported.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2011, David Pollack at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted that, [...] "Al jazeera Arabic did {{not report}} on the {{hardening}} of the Bahraini opposition on March 8, when the Coalition for a Bahraini Republic {{called for an end}} to the monarchy, nor did it cover protests held there on March 9, 10, and 13, the critical days leading to Saudi Arabia's decision to send troops into Bahrain." [...] In one extreme example Pollack noted that at one point Al Jazeera English <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Saudi troops headed across the causeway connecting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain while Al Jazeera Arabic ran a completely different headline proclaiming [...] "Bahrain's Government Rejects Foreign Intervention" [...] — alluding to a rejection Iranian interference.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{has spoken}} highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it {{possibly}} the best {{car in the}} world, and used 20 minutes of a Top Gear episode putting the Yeti {{through a number of}} challenges to support his point. Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa's latest sports car, [...] "Cameron Diaz on wheels". Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls. Of the Monaro he said, [...] "It's like they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> me on their desk and said [...] 'Let's build that bloke a car!'" [...] and [...] "I can't believe it... I've fallen in love... with a Vauxhall!" [...] Clarkson suffered two slipped discs that he attributed to driving the Monaro, which he described as being [...] "back-breakingly marvellous".

2500|$|In May 1998, India {{conducted}} five {{nuclear tests}} at the Pokharan range in Rajasthan. Earlier a staunch supporter of nuclear disarmament, Fernandes openly endorsed the NDA government's decision {{to test the}} nuclear bombs. He was also involved in skirmishes with the then Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy, Vishnu Bhagwat, over promotion of Vice-Admiral Harinder Singh as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. Bhagwat was subsequently sacked over the issue. After the Tehelka defence scandal broke out in March 2001, Fernandes quit as defence minister, but was reappointed to the post later. Fernandes {{has been the only}} defence minister of a nuclear power who has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima bombing in his office. He has made 18 visits to the icy heights of the [...] Siachen glacier in Kashmir, which holds the record of being [...] "the world's highest battlefield". He was known for overseeing a huge increase in India's defence budget as compared to the allocations made by previous governments.|$|E

Nor could it," [...] wrote Justice Brennan in his dissent. He and Justice Marshall agreed with the lower courts that there was sufficient indication that the column was opinion to protect it as such: {{it was on the}} sports page, it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the author with [...] "TD Says" [...] in it, and in the text itself, [...] "Diadiun not only reveals the facts upon which he is relying, but he makes it clear at which point he runs out of facts and is simply guessing." [...] He notes that Diadiun used [...] "apparently" [...] when referring to Milkovich and Scott's testimony in Columbus and that no one could take [...] "knows in his heart" [...] as a statement of literal fact, as it is inherently hyperbolic. [...] "Readers could see that Diadiun was focused on the court's reversal of the OHSAA's decision, and was angrily supposing what must have led to it," [...] he concluded. Citing several recent historical incidents where many commentators had speculated as to what had occurred with much less complete knowledge of the facts, he said [...] "conjecture is a means of fueling a national discourse on such questions and stimulating public pressure for answers from those who know more ... Punishing (it) protects reputation only at the cost of expunging a genuinely useful mechanism for public debate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{attempting}} to give precise figures, some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated {{the number of}} murders by this order from 1865 to 1875; {{but no one can}} go through the evidence without being convinced that a great many men were killed to satisfy the vengeful spirit of the Molly Maguires. Some of the victims were men so useful, so conspicuous, and so beloved in their communities that their assassinations caused a profound and enduring impression. In some cases, so Dewees (who has written a very useful story) asserts, robbery was added to murder: superintendents, who were carrying the money for the monthly pay of the miners and laborers, were waylaid as they drove along some lonely road in the desolate country. While the murders were numerous, still more numerous were the threats of murder and warnings to leave the country written on a sheet of paper with a rude picture of a coffin or a pistol and sometimes both. One notice read: [...] "Mr. John Taylor-We will give you one week to go, but if you are alive on next Saturday you will die." [...] Another, to three bosses, charged with [...] "cheating thy men" [...] <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> three pistols and a coffin and on the coffin was written, [...] "This is your home." [...] In other mining districts and in manufacturing localities, during strikes and times of turbulence similar warnings have been common and have been laughed at by mining bosses, superintendents, and proprietors; but, in the anthracite region between 1865 and 1876 the bravest of men could not forget how many of his fellows had been shot and suppress a feeling of uneasiness when he found such a missive on his doorstep or posted up on the door of his office at the mine. Many a superintendent and mining boss left his house in the morning with his hand on his revolver, wondering if he would ever see wife and children again.|$|E

The new bridge is within a minute's walk of the monument; and we went thither, and leaned over its parapet to admire the beautiful Doon, flowing wildly and sweetly between its deep and wooded banks. I never saw a lovelier scene; although this might have been even lovelier, if a kindly sun had shone upon it. The ivy-grown, ancient bridge, with its high arch, through which we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the river and the green banks beyond, was absolutely the most picturesque object, in a quiet and gentle way, that ever blessed my eyes.

60|$|And moreover, besides, {{the thing}} they always said about {{them seemed to}} me to be stretchers.

Thirteen acres, you see, for just one building; it's a farm. If it hadn't been in Sunday-school, I would 'a' judged it was a lie; and outside I was certain of it. And he said there was a hole in the pyramid, and you could go in there with candles, and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel, and come to a large room in the stomach of that stone mountain, and there you would find a big stone chest with a king in it, four thousand years old. I said to myself, then, if that ain't a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him, for even Methusalem warn't that old, and nobody claims it.|$|E
