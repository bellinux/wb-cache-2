Between permanently fixed and completely flexible however, are heterogeneous approaches. They have different implications for {{the extent to which}} national authorities participate in foreign exchange markets. According to their degree of flexibility, post-Bretton Woods-exchange rate regimes are arranged into three categories: currency unions, dollarized regimes, currency boards and conventional currency pegs are described as “fixed-rate regimes”; Horizontal bands, crawling pegs and crawling bands are grouped into “intermediate regimes”; Managed and independent floats are described as flexible regimes.All monetary regimes except for the permanently fixed regime experience the time inconsistency problem and exchange rate volatility, albeit to different degrees.|$|E

By focusing on {{the roles of the}} dollar, the yen, and the euro as anchor currencies for <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stabilization, the paper claims that the dollar played a dominant role as a de jure or de facto anchor for emerging East Asia until the 1997 – 98 currency crisis.

40|$|IT is {{now more}} than a decade since the world {{abandoned}} the system of fixed but adjustable <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> which was the center-piece of the old Bretton Woods system. That system collapsed in 1973 with no official agreement on what was to replace it, and the major currencies were set afloat in world currency markets. These arrangements, which at first had no official international sanction, were later legitimised by the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF in 1978 which allowed members to adopt <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangements</b> of their choice. The new system, which some have called a "non-system", is characterized by a mix of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Major currencies float relatively freely in world currency markets.

40|$|Currently, five Central and Eastern European (CEE) {{countries}} are negotiating about the {{membership in the}} European Union: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovak Republic. There is a broad consensus that they will eventually become members of the European Monetary Union. This requires careful analysis of the appropriate exchange rate regime prior to the accession. The <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the EU applicants plays an important - but not exclusive - role in their policy-mix. The history of transition economies {{as well as of}} other emerging markets illustrates that exchange rate policies as such are not a distinctive factor for the success and failure of monetary policy with respect to price stability. In this paper it is argued that this outcome has not emerged by chance. There is no naturally superior exchange rate regime that can be applied to all advanced countries in transition aiming at stability. By way of contrast, an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangement</b> is part of the monetary regime, which itself is a component of the economic order. The latter consists of both politically chosen and spontaneously evolved institutions. This leads to the hypothesis that the choice of an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangement</b> in CEE is constrained by this institutional setting. The theoretical considerations as well as empirical evidence indeed suggest that for guaranteeing stability, beside the legal monetary commitment (part of which being the exchange rate regime) the institutional framework in the country is decisive. If the latter matches the commitment, the credibility of a monetary regime is relatively high, obviously encouraging monetary stability. Therefore, the institutional setting in each country should be analysed extensively before an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangement</b> is chosen. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the effect of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangements</b> on international tourism. The ambiguity of literature about the effect of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility contrasts with the magnitude of the impact of a common currency on trade. On the basis of a gravity equation we estimate a moderate effect of a currency union on tourism of almost 12 %. Furthermore, we estimate a gravity equation for international trade, obtaining that the common currency effect on trade is reduced when tourism is introduced as a regressor. This suggests that tourism flows may contribute to explain the excessive magnitude of the estimated effect of a common currency on trade in this literature. Finally, we analyze the impact of several de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangements</b> on tourism, finding that less flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> promotes tourism flows.

Thus, a monetary union within the EAEU would not be feasible for Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, a monetary union between Kazakhstan and Russia might become feasible, but not necessarily beneficial for Kazakhstan in the long-term perspective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the factors which determine the strength of commitment that policymakers choose to back up a fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system. In practice the commitment level is achieved by choosing a particular set of monetary and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The authors develop a Barro-Gordon type model in which the policymaker has to decide how much to commit under uncertainty. An important assumption is that the stronger the commitment to the fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> the greater the political cost of reneging on it. Thus, prior to deciding on the choice of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangements</b> the policymaker has to weigh the benefits, to the disinflation program, from making a strong commitment against the potential costs of being forced to renege on it.

The paper finds that a more flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arrangement,</b> for example a peg to a common European currency, is appealing because it better reflects trade flows and may reduce exchange rate variability with non-CFA countries in West and Central Africa, thus aiding regional development.
