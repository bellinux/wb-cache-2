50|$|<b>Epristeride</b> {{is unique}} in its {{mechanism}} of action relative to finasteride and dutasteride in that it binds irreversibly to 5α-reductase and results {{in the formation of}} an unproductive complex of the 5α-reductase enzyme, the substrate testosterone, and the cofactor NADPH. For this reason, testosterone is caught in a trap, and it was initially speculated that the reciprocal increase in intraprostatic levels of testosterone seen with finasteride and dutasteride should not happen with <b>epristeride.</b> However, subsequent clinical data have not supported this hypothesis. Moreover, {{in spite of the fact}} that <b>epristeride</b> is a very potent inhibitor of 5α-reductase type II (0.18-2 nM), it has been found to reduce circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by only 25 to 54% following 8 days of therapy over a dosage range of 0.4 to 160 mg/day. For this reason, relative to other 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride, the degree of DHT suppression with <b>epristeride</b> falls short of that desirable for full clinical benefit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Epristeride</b> (INN, USAN, BAN, JAN) (brand names Aipuliete, Chuanliu; former {{developmental}} code names ONO-9302, SKF-105,657) is a steroidal 5α-reductase inhibitor {{that has}} been marketed in China since 2000 {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is a selective, transition-state, non-competitive or uncompetitive, irreversible inhibitor of 5α-reductase, and is specific to the type II isoform of the enzyme similarly to finasteride and turosteride.|$|E
5000|$|Androgen {{synthesis}} inhibitors: {{drugs that}} directly inhibit the enzymatic biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or DHT. Examples include the CYP17A1 inhibitors ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and seviteronel, the CYP11A1 (P450scc) inhibitor aminoglutethimide, and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride, dutasteride, <b>epristeride,</b> alfatradiol, and saw palmetto extract (Serenoa repens).

These drugs also inhibit the formation of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), and 3α-androstanediol from progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and DHT, respectively, which may contribute to side effects such as depression and sexual dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH), skin {{disorders such as}} acne, male pattern baldness and hirsutism are androgen-re-lated disorders, and {{are associated}} with elevated levels of di-hydrotestosterone (DHT). 4) 5 a-Reductase is an NADPH-de-pendent enzyme responsible for the conversion of testos-terone to DHT. As a consequence, a 5 a-reductase inhibitor is expected to provide a potential treatment for BPH. Several 5 a-reductase inhibitors have been reported which might pro-vide a novel therapeutic treatment for androgen-related disor-ders, 5, 6) including both steroidal inhibitors, finasteride 5 a) and <b>epristeride,</b> 5 b) and a nonsteroidal inhibitor, ONO- 38056 a) (Fig. 1). Following the discovery of these inhibitors, the existence of two different 5 a-reductase isozymes, called type 1 and type 2 5 a-reductase, {{have been reported in}} humans and rats. 7 — 9) The type 1 enzyme is normal in men with congenital 5 a-reductase deficiency and is expressed in skin tissue throughout the body that has an optimal pH of between 6 and 9. The type 2 enzyme is defective in men with congenital 5 a-reductase deficiency and is the dominant form of the en-zyme in genital tissue, including prostate that has an optimal pH of about 5. 5. However, the physiological role of these isozymes has yet to be fully elucidated. Steroidal inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy for the treatment of BPH; however, there is a possibility of adverse effects due to their steroidal structures. 10) On the other hand, nonsteroidal in-hibitors have not shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of BPH. Finasteride showed strong inhibitory activity (IC 505 4. 1 nM) 11) for human prostatic 5 a-reductase, whereas ONO- 3805 showed only moderate activity (IC 505538 nM) 11) which might not be sufficient to show clinical efficacy. We consid-ered that a more potent nonsteroidal inhibitor of human pro-static 5 a-reductase than ONO- 3805 could show clinical effi-cacy for the treatment of BPH and have reduced potential for side effects compared to steroidal inhibitors. To develop po-tent nonsteroidal 5 a-reductase inhibitors, we began a chemi-cal file screening program and found that the benzoic acid derivative 1 showed moderate inhibitory activity for 5 a-re-ductase in HS 27 human foreskin fibroblast cells 8) with an IC 50 value of 317 nM. In order to increase the inhibitory activ-ity against human prostatic 5 a-reductase, we began modifi...|$|E
