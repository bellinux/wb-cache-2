5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that <b>hurts</b> <b>the</b> vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches {{at the mouth of}} a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.|$|E
25|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{went into}} effect on January 1, 1994, {{which led to the}} {{elimination}} of tariffs and other trade barriers between Mexico and the U.S. and serves as a multilateral platform for cooperation between both countries. The agreement increased trade volume and cooperation in both countries. The free trade agreement has been increasingly opposed by Mexican and U.S. farmers, with many groups and the political left presenting that it <b>hurts</b> <b>the</b> interest of traditional, small and local farmers in both countries. Allegations of violations of labor and environmental laws have been considered by the trilateral institutions. The Bush Administration argued that NAFTA had had modest positive impacts on all three member countries, but Mexican farmers have strongly criticized the effects of the agreement as they have become overshadowed by the large corporations benefiting from NAFTA. Notable bilateral trade disputes relate to trucking, tuna, sweeteners and anti-dumping measures.|$|E

500|$|The {{growth of}} lesbian {{feminism}} in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused {{to work with}} gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—entrapment and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized {{as an alternative to}} sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed [...] "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars".

500|$|Sellers's last {{film was}} The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous {{adventure}} novels by Sax Rohmer; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The {{production of the}} film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—Richard Quine and John Avildsen—fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as [...] "an indefensibly inept comedy", adding that [...] "it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. [...] "Manchu" [...] will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as Tell Me Where It <b>Hurts,</b> <b>The</b> Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda".|$|E

[...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press that the band [...] " [...] spot-on when they floor it or put it in park; it’s the sputtering along in-between that <b>hurts</b> <b>the</b> record." [...] Despite not mastering [...] "the art of the middle ground," [...] they take [...] "immense leaps forward musically on their third album."
