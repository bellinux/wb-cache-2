25|$|Family {{members who}} {{identify}} {{more with the}} culture of their home country may experience frustration when they attempt to instill their cultural values into younger family members. Popular media, schools, and peers act as powerful socializing agents {{and members of the}} older generation may feel that they cannot compete with these pervasive cultural and social forces. Parents may blame television and magazines for the unwanted change they see in their children and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>decide</b> to act by cracking down on their children's access to popular media, this may lead to further generational schisms.|$|E
25|$|She {{decided to}} open a child care center in Montgomery County, but she found the state {{licensing}} process to be burdensome. She reasoned {{that it must be}} even more burdensome for individuals who have limited or no English-speaking abilities, leaving them at risk of fines and closures <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>decide</b> to provide unlicensed child care services. In 1998, Navarro co-founded Centro Familia, a small local nonprofit organization that trained people so they can be licensed in child care. She volunteered for the organization at no pay until the organization received enough state and county grant money that it could pay her a salary and hire four instructors two years later. She was with the organization until 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Paddick published in The Daily Telegraph on 17 November 2007 detailing his thinking on becoming London Mayor, {{he made a}} revealing comment possibly connected with difficulties that have arisen because of the de Menezes killing: [...] "Policing is a dangerous job, we should trust the professional judgement of officers on the front line. We shouldn't prosecute them or their bosses <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>decide</b> to put {{their lives on the}} line for the public." [...] In addition, on 26 November 2007 in The Independent Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: [...] "Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding that someone will be held to account if something goes wrong. An innocent man was killed by the police and in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{characteristic}} of Neocolonialism is that Colonial powers continue {{to exploit the}} resources of their colonized counterpart for economic or political interests. [...] "Wild Seed" [...] exhibits neocolonialism {{in the relationship between}} Doro and Anyanwu and the relationship between Doro and his descendants. Doro uses Anyanwu's children in order to continue his exploitation of her supernatural abilities. He notes that [...] "Her children would hold her even if her husband did not." [...] Anyanwu does not want to endanger her children by attempting to escape or kill Doro. Even after she tries {{to start a new life}} on a plantation, he breeds with her to pass on her supernatural abilities to his children. He has a vested interest in her powers, and he refuses to let her go. Anyanwu's children face the same struggle when attempting to escape Doro. Doro threatens them with death in order to keep them under his control. He purposely creates villages for his people so that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>decide</b> to leave they will be left with nothing. They rely on Doro for kinship and protection. In return, Doro uses them for his own gains.|$|E

Were you selected for this, as we consider it, great honor, there would be at least a year before you; and you might then, in some manner, make your escape beyond our boundaries.

60|$|The {{political}} emancipation {{of women}} is {{likely to lead to}} a comparatively stringent enforcement by law of sexual morality (that is why so many of us dread it); and this will soon compel us to consider what our sexual morality shall be. At present a ridiculous distinction is made between vice and crime, in order that men may be vicious with impunity. Adultery, for instance, though it is sometimes fiercely punished by giving an injured husband crushing damages in a divorce suit (injured wives are not considered in this way), is not now directly prosecuted; and this impunity extends to illicit relations between unmarried persons who have reached what is called the age of consent. There are other matters, such as notification of contagious disease and solicitation, in which the hand of the law has been brought down on one sex only. Outrages which were capital offences within the memory of persons still living when committed on women outside marriage, can still be inflicted by men on their wives without legal remedy. At all such points the code will be screwed up by the operation of Votes for Women, if there be any virtue in the franchise at all. The result will be that men will find the more ascetic side of our sexual morality taken seriously by the law. It is easy to foresee the consequences. No man will take much trouble to alter laws which he can evade, or which are either not enforced or enforced on women only. But when these laws take him by the collar and thrust him into prison, he suddenly becomes keenly critical of them, and of the arguments by which they are supported. Now we have seen that our marriage laws will not stand criticism, and that they have held out so far only because they are so worked as to fit roughly our state of society, in which women are neither politically nor personally free, in which indeed women are called womanly only when they regard themselves as existing solely for the use of men. When Liberalism enfranchises them politically, and Socialism emancipates them economically, they will no longer allow the law to take immorality so easily. Both men and women will be forced to behave morally in sex matters; and when they find that this is inevitable they will raise the question of what behavior really should be established as moral. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>decide</b> in favor of our present professed morality they will have to make a revolutionary change in their habits by becoming in fact what they only pretend to be at present. If, on the other hand, they find that this would be an unbearable tyranny, without even the excuse of justice or sound eugenics, they will reconsider their morality and remodel the law.|$|E
