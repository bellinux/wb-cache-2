5|$|Unbiunium, {{also known}} as eka-actinium or element 121, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Ubu and atomic number 121. Unbiunium and Ubu are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, it <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first of the superactinides, and the third element in the eighth period: analogously to lanthanum and actinium, it {{could be considered the}} fifth member of group 3 and the first member of the fifth-row transition metals. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior {{common to the}} halogens. For example, the extant {{members of the group}} routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, one having eight electrons (octet) in its valence shell. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts− couple is predicted to be −0.25V; this value is negative and thus tennessine should not be reduced to the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all {{the previous}} halogens.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, {{speculation}} {{began on}} what Hunt would do past the expiration {{of his contract}} {{at the end of}} the 2009 season. With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, Hunt <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated their intentions to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated their intentions to make a bid for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000. The Broncos however, were still expected to be a factor in his decision with the possibility of the captaincy a possible lure to remain with the Broncos.|$|E
5|$|NuScale <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first SMR to market, {{because its}} cooling {{is similar to}} the systems used in {{conventional}} power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and {{do not have access to}} natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna resurrected {{the question of}} which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern–Levison parameter estimated to be much less than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is bright enough, and therefore large enough, that this <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case, and several astronomers have called it one.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener hassium <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E
