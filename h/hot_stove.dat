40|$|The <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} equipment devices in the blast furnace iron making process. The temperature and duration of hot air are the crucial parameters to assess the performance of the <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove.</b> In order to sustain the desired high temperature air, it requires rapid completed combustion reaction, stable flue gas flow structure, and uniform temperature distribution throughout the regenerator. In the present work, a 3 D numerical model with all essential turbulence, heat transfer, and combustion considerations has been developed to assess the performance of a typical <b>hot</b> air <b>stove.</b> The flow field of the whole domain and temperature distribution within the regenerator were simulated using the model. The predicted results show that the velocity at each nozzle varies substantially due to the uneven pressure distribution in cavity of the traditional <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove,</b> generating the eccentric vortex that leads to nonuniform temperature distribution in the regenerator. In order to solve this problem, a new structure design of top combustion regenerative <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> is proposed. Numerical simulations were then carried out to compare based on the performance of the new <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> design against the traditional <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove...</b>|$|R

Even more seats were added in 1965 and new mezzanine galleries were constructed in 1966 and 1967. By 1968, seating capacity for hockey had grown to 16,485.

2500|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of neural}} circuit is a reflex arc, which {{begins with a}} sensory input and ends with a motor output, passing through a sequence of neurons connected in series. [...] This can be shown in the [...] "withdrawal reflex" [...] causing a hand to jerk back after a <b>hot</b> <b>stove</b> is touched. [...] The circuit begins with sensory receptors in the skin that are activated by harmful levels of heat: [...] a special type of molecular structure embedded in the membrane causes heat to change the electrical field across the membrane. [...] If the change in electrical potential {{is large enough to}} pass the given threshold, it evokes an action potential, which is transmitted along the axon of the receptor cell, into the spinal cord. [...] There the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with other cells, some of which project (send axonal output) to the same region of the spinal cord, others projecting into the brain. [...] One target is a set of spinal interneurons that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles. [...] The interneurons excite the motor neurons, and if the excitation is strong enough, some of the motor neurons generate action potentials, which travel down their axons {{to the point where they}} make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle cells. [...] The excitatory signals induce contraction of the muscle cells, which causes the joint angles in the arm to change, pulling the arm away.|$|E

Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{improvement}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the operation of a block of <b>hot</b> blast <b>stoves</b> of the blast furnace in order to rise the temperature of the blast-furnace air was considered. It was shown that an increase of the temperature of the blast-furnace air without the use of natural gas and oxygen for combustion is possible due to the changing of the operation modes of a block of <b>hot</b> blast <b>stoves</b> and at the increase of the pressure of the exchange gas. An analysis of the recent researches and publications describing the methods for determining the parameters of the operation of the block of <b>hot</b> blast <b>stoves</b> of the blast furnace was performed; their advantages and disadvantages were described. The goal of the research was set. A database of process parameters of the block was processed to determine the main characteristics of the operation of <b>hot</b> blast <b>stoves</b> of the blast furnace. Averaged values of the basic technical and design parameters were obtained; they characterize the operation of each <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> of the block with the use of which the adjustment of a mathematical model of the operation of each of <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> of the block was achieved. A method for determining the main unit operating parameters on the block on the account of the desired blast temperature was designed. The values of the duration of the cycle "heating + air blasting" depending on the set-point temperature of the smoke at various values of air blasting temperatures were determined for each <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> of the block using a mathematical model. The authors suggested to use such dependencies to determine the temporal parameters of the operation of the block of <b>hot</b> blast <b>stoves.</b> The obtained values of the duration of heating periods and air blasting of each <b>hot</b> blast <b>stove</b> of the block should be corrected if the continuity of the air blast supply to the blast furnace is not ensured.

40|$|With oxygen {{enrichment}} in <b>hot</b> <b>stoves</b> the high calorific {{coke oven gas}} can be saved due {{to the possibility of}} using lower calorific gases which enables replacement of other imported fuels such as oil or LPG. The application of increased oxygen use in <b>hot</b> <b>stoves</b> or increased O 2 in blast, will also potentially lead to lower coke rate.

An analysis of the influence of increased {{oxygen enrichment}} on the entire energy system has been carried out by use of an optimization model.
