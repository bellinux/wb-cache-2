Clark and his officers recruited volunteers from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. The men gathered in early May near the Falls of the Ohio, south of Fort Pitt.

In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.|$|E
5|$|Human {{reactions}} to the sea are found in, for example, literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music, {{as well as in}} mythology and the psychotherapeutic interpretation of dreams. The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in myth and legend; its mention in proverbs and folk song; the use of ships in votive offerings; the importance of ships and the sea in initiation ceremonies and in mortuary rites; children playing with toy boats; adults making model ships; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters.

25|$|By medieval standards, {{conditions}} for Jews under Islam were generally more formalized {{and better than}} those of Jews in Christian lands, {{in part due to}} the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews <b>in</b> <b>lands</b> with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status <b>in</b> <b>lands</b> with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of massacres and ethnic cleansing of Jews in North Africa, especially in Morocco, Libya and Algeria where eventually Jews were forced to live in ghettos. Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the Middle Ages in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. At certain times in Yemen, Morocco and Baghdad, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{valuation}} {{data from}} Quotable Value New Zealand to examine {{changes in the}} value of the rural <b>land</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand between 1989 and 2003. The value of rural land reflects the profitability of agriculture as well as the returns to alternative land uses, and has a large impact on the prosperity of rural areas. The paper highlights the importance of both changes <b>in</b> <b>land</b> use and changes {{in the value of}} <b>land</b> <b>in</b> different uses in explaining overall changes <b>in</b> <b>land</b> values. It also examines the relationship among productive characteristics of the land, the local climate, various local amenities, and changes <b>in</b> <b>land</b> values and land use to better understand what factors have been driving overall changes in the value of rural land across New Zealand. We find that the real value of rural <b>land</b> <b>in</b> all uses increased substantially over the years being examined. <b>Land</b> use <b>in</b> rural areas also changed considerably during this period, but these changes <b>in</b> <b>land</b> use were essentially uncorrelated with changes <b>in</b> <b>land</b> values. Our regression results indicate that rural land values increased the most in less populated areas with good climates and local amenities. Initial land use also plays an important role in explaining the variation in changes <b>in</b> rural <b>land</b> values with greater increases <b>in</b> <b>land</b> values found <b>in</b> areas with more land initially devoted to urban uses and commercial forestry, and less land initially devoted to horticulture and lifestyle uses.

40|$|Rationale To {{identify}} the possible savings {{in the cost}} of primary health care of chronic disease associated with the participation by Aboriginal people <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management. <b>In</b> so-doing we investigate the connection of health of Aboriginal people and the extent of their involvement <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management <b>in</b> remote-very remote Australia. Methods Possible savings in primary care costs for hypertension, renal disease and diabetes were estimated using multivariate regression to examine associations between Aboriginal involvement <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management and Northern Territory Government-defined chronic disease outcomes, controlling for socio-demographics and health behaviours. Participants were 298 Aboriginal adults aged 15 - 54 from a remote Aboriginal community, classified by their chronic disease status and a previously validated measure of self-reported participation <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management activities. Results Land management participants were significantly less likely to have diabetes, renal disease or hypertension. Using the sampled mean value of engagement <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management, we found the expected net annual savings for the community from involvement <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management of $ 268, 000. This equates to a net present value of primary health care savings in chronic disease care for the sampled community over 25 years of $ 4. 08 million. This estimate does not include further savings in other primary health conditions nor costs anticipated in referred and hospital-based health care for chronic disease. Conclusion While the association between involvement <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management and better health requires further clarification, our findings indicate that significant and substantial primary health care cost savings may be associated with greater participation <b>in</b> <b>land</b> management activities. These estimated savings are in addition to the market and non-market economic benefits of a healthier population and environmental benefits.
