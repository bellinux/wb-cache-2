40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} to {{establish}} a simple approach for prediction of the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> of a wood particle assuming that the thermo-physical properties remain constant and ignition takes place at a characteristic ignition temperature. Using a time and space integral method, explicit relationships are derived for computation of the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> of particles of three common shapes (slab, cylinder and sphere), which may be characterized as thermally thin or thermally thick. It is shown through a dimensionless analysis that the dimensionless <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> can be described as a function of non-dimensional ignition temperature, reactor temperature or external incident heat flux, and parameter K which represents the ratio of conduction heat transfer to the external radiation heat transfer. The numerical results reveal that for the dimensionless ignition temperature between 1. 25 and 2. 25 and for values of K up to 8000 (corresponding to woody materials), the variation of the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> of a thermally thin particle with K and the dimensionless ignition temperature is linear, whereas the dependence of the <b>ignition</b> <b>time</b> of a thermally thick particle on the above two parameters obeys a quadratic function.

40|$|Applications {{of natural}} gases that contain {{high levels of}} {{hydrogen}} have become a primary interest in the gas turbine market. For reheat gas turbines, understanding of the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>times</b> of high-hydrogen natural gases is important for two reasons. First, if the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time</b> is too short, autoignition can occur in the mixer before the primary combustor. Second, the flame in the secondary burner is stabilized by the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time</b> of the fuel. While the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>times</b> of hydrogen and of the individual hydrocarbons in natural gases can be considered well known, {{there have been few}} previous experimental studies into the effects of different levels of hydrogen on the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>times</b> of natural gases at gas turbine conditions. In order {{to examine the effects of}} hydrogen content at gas turbine conditions, shock-tube experiments were performed on nine combinations of an L 9 matrix. The L 9 matrix was developed by varying four factors: natural gas higher-order hydrocarbon content of 0, 18. 75, or 37. 5 %; hydrogen content of the total fuel mixture of 30, 60, or 80 %; equivalence ratios of 0. 3, 0. 5, or 1; and pressures of 1, 10, or 30 atm. Temperatures ranged from 1092 K to 1722 K, and all mixtures were diluted in 90 % Ar. Correlations for each combination were developed from the <b>ignition</b> delay <b>times</b> and, using these correlations, a factor sensitivity analysis was performed. It was found that hydrogen played the most significant role in <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time.</b> Pressure was almost as important as hydrogen content, especially as temperature increased.

Further analysis was performed using <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time</b> calculations for the full matrix of combinations (27 combinations for each natural gas) using a detailed chemical kinetics mechanism.
