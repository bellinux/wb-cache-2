5|$|Hall {{initially}} {{sought to}} appeal to the State Council of the LCL. Although the body had no binding authority over the parliamentary caucus, which chose the leader, Hall and his followers saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for a media victory. The motion went narrowly against Hall, but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked a tenuous {{border between the}} American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war because they saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to halt the {{expansion}} of the American colonies and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E

5|$|At the time, digital {{distribution}} was gaining popularity. The two saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would {{require them to}} first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies. Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees. The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game Flow—a component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming PlayStation Network distribution system, and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E

50|$|The first fair in Blenheim Township, Oxford County, {{was held}} in 1850 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{community}} event on John Spiers Farm, just outside of Drumbo. <b>It</b> started <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for local farmers to showcase their crops and livestock.

5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{was also}} {{building}} branches in North Wales, which {{were intended to}} link up to the River Dee at Chester, but eventually linked to the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction, just {{to the north of}} Nantwich, in 1805. The canal then became the middle section of a much longer and more profitable canal. The two companies merged in 1813, becoming the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. When the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was proposed in 1826, which would provide a link from Nantwich to Wolverhampton and the Birmingham canal system, the company saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to build the Middlewich Branch, which would provide a connection to Manchester and the Potteries. The branch opened in 1833, and the Junction Canal opened in 1835. Amalgamation followed in 1845, with the new company retaining the name of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. The following year, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company was formed from the Ellesmere and Chester company, which also took over a number of canals which joined theirs. Plans to convert some of the canals to railways were put on hold in the 1847, when the canal company was leased to the London and North Western Railway. Under railway control, the canals continued to operate successfully, but decline set in during the 20th century, and when many of the adjoining canals were closed in 1944, the sections which had been the Ellesmere and Chester Canal and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, together with the Middlewich Branch, were retained.|$|E

25|$|Reactions to Chiang's {{kidnapping}} in Yan'an were mixed. Some, including Mao Zedong and Zhu De, viewed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to have Chiang killed. Others, including Zhou Enlai and Zhang Wentian, saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to achieve}} a united-front policy against the Japanese, which would strengthen the overall position of the CCP. Debate within Yan'an ended when a long telegram from Joseph Stalin arrived, urging the CCP to work towards Chiang's release, explaining that a united-front was the best position from which to resist the Japanese, and that only Chiang had the prestige and authority to carry out such a plan.|$|E
