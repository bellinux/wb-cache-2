40|$|Over-height {{trucks are}} not only a hazard to the over-height trucks themselves, but they {{pose a threat to}} the bridges they come into contact with, and most {{importantly}} the other drivers on the road way when a collision takes place with a low clearance structure. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an over-height detection system that is affordable yet also reliable. At this time there exist over-height detection systems using laser and infrared beam devices however, they are expensive. This high cost makes it impossible for Department of Transportations across the nation to implement these systems at all low-clearance headroom roadways. In this research a machine vision based system is proposed to detect the height of trucks and provide a warning for over-height vehicles. The <b>height</b> <b>determination</b> will be completed using line detection and blob tracking; these two methods will be overlapped where an upper point of the truck can be compared to a lower point on the ground. These 2 D coordinates will then be translated into 3 D world coordinates that will provide an approximation of the truck height. If the truck is over the set height then a warning will sound. The accuracy of the test proves that the method is a reliable method of <b>height</b> <b>determination,</b> achieving a 96. 59 % accuracy rate for measured trucks. The method does have an error rate of 3. 3 %. The merit of this work is the creation of an automatic image based method which can provide <b>height</b> <b>determination</b> of trucks and is a low cost alternative to the current expensive laser and infrared detection systems.

Cloud-top heights can be inferred using this technique of both the BUV radiance and its degree of polarization are measured by a spacecraft and compared with theoretical values. The cases of satellites with high-inclination orbits and geosynchronous satellites are discussed here. Based on calculations of radiance and polarization, the resolutions of cloud-top <b>height</b> <b>determinations</b> are roughly estimated in both cases. The estimates show that inference is possible {{as long as the}} angle between the direction of the sun and the satellite from the point of interest in the atmosphere is larger than about 10 deg. The estimates also indicate that the cloud-top-height resolution depends on solar zenith angle theta(0) in the case of nadir observation by satellites in nonequatorial orbits: The resolution is about 0. 5 km for theta(0) = 30 and about 0. 3 km for larger theta(0). On the other hand, when observations are made by geosynchronous satellites, the resolution depends strongly on the latitude of the point of interest, alpha(1); a resolution within 0. 4 km can be achieved for alpha(1) {{less than or equal to}} 65 deg (0. 2 km resolution can be obtained for middle latitudes).
