5|$|All {{members of}} the SASR are {{parachute}} qualified, and each member of a patrol {{has at least one}} specialisation, including medic, signaller, explosive expert or linguist. Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and building clearance. This training is conducted in a range of advanced facilities, including electronic indoor and outdoor CQB ranges, outdoor sniper range, and urban training facilities at Swanbourne. Additional facilities include a special urban complex, vertical plunging range, method of entry house, and simulated oil rig and aircraft mock-ups in order to provide realistic training environments for potential operational scenarios. Free-Fall training includes <b>High</b> <b>Altitude</b> Parachute Operations (HAPO) either <b>High</b> <b>Altitude</b> Low Opening (HALO) or <b>High</b> <b>Altitude</b> High Opening (HAHO) conducted at a maximum of 25,000 feet. SASR personnel also provide training in weapons handling to ASIS operatives at Swan Island in Victoria. Despite a possible reduction in rank, SASR operators receive significant allowances, which make them among the highest-paid soldiers in the Australian Defence Force, with a trooper (equivalent to a private) reportedly earning about $100,000 per annum in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Superchargers in {{aircraft}} play {{an important}} role by providing additional air pressure at <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Because air pressure decreases at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> air compression is necessary {{in order to keep the}} airplane’s engine running at maximum efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|... == Surviving falls == A falling {{person at}} low {{altitude}} will reach terminal velocity after about 12 seconds, falling some 450 m (1,500 ft) in that time. He will then maintain this speed without falling any faster. Terminal velocity at <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes</b> is greater {{due to the}} thinner atmosphere and consequent lower air resistance; free-fallers from <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> including Kittinger, Baumgartner and Eustace discussed in this article, fell faster at <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes.</b>|$|R
30|$|The large eastward {{electric}} field lifts up the F layer to a <b>higher</b> <b>altitude</b> through E[*]×[*]B drift. At <b>higher</b> <b>altitude,</b> where {{the frequency of}} neutral-ion collisions is lower, {{the growth rate of}} plasma bubble becomes larger. This helps the bubble to grow and reach <b>higher</b> <b>altitude.</b> In short, our finding indicates that the key factor of plasma bubble extension is the altitude of bottomside F layer and the magnitude of PRE, not the duration of PRE.|$|R

50|$|Screamers {{are highly}} pneumatized birds with {{pneumatic}} diverticula traveling throughout {{the bones and}} into the skin. As screamers fly at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> it is hypothesized that the extreme pneumaticity in these birds is indicative of an adaptation for flying in <b>high</b> <b>altitudes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Situated {{along the}} {{southwest}} of the Serra de Santa Bárbara, the parish occupies a transition zone between oceanic and Mediterranean climate (on the Köppen-Geiger classification between Csb, on the lower areas, and Cfb, on <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes),</b> exposed to strong southwest winds, resulting in elevated humidity during periods of atmospheric instability, intense orthographic precipitation in the <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Precipitation along the massif results in flooding along the shallow ravines, which are unable to transport the water that flows from the <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect that}} <b>high</b> <b>altitudes</b> have on iron metabolism and summarizes {{the results of an}} iron-folate supplementation trial. The two main objectives of the trial were to determine hemoglobin cut-off values for the diagnosis of anemia in Bolivian women of childbearing age living at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> and to estimate the prevalence of anemia in this population. The study showed that nutritional anemia is an important public health problem in such populations and that many methods of assessing it lead to an underestimation of prevalence. The cutt-off values defined trough this study, one of the few iron supplementation trials conducted at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> confirm the need to establish revised hemoglobin values for the diagnosis of anemia in populations living at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
5|$|As a <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> {{species with}} limited contact with humans until the {{development}} of mountain tourism activities, the Alpine chough has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), a piano piece written in 1956–58. Le chocard des alpes ("The Alpine Chough") is the opening piece of Book 1 of the work.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude {{before or after}} diving can have a significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus forms from {{tropical}} cyclones, and {{is commonly}} seen fanning {{out from the}} eyewalls of hurricanes. A large shield of cirrus and cirrostratus typically accompanies the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> outflow of hurricanes or typhoons, and these can make the underlying rain bands—and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.|$|E

50|$|An {{altitude}} tent is {{a sealed}} tent used to simulate a <b>higher</b> <b>altitude</b> with reduced oxygen. The basic concept of living or training at altitude is {{to cause the}} body {{to adapt to the}} lower oxygen content by producing more oxygen-carrying red blood cells and hemoglobin. Training or spending time at a <b>higher</b> <b>altitude</b> will cause the body to adapt to the <b>higher</b> <b>altitude</b> and provide enhanced performance when returning to a lower altitude. Mountain climbers can use them to avoid altitude sickness, and athletes can use them to enhance performance at lower altitudes.|$|R
5|$|Sirius can be {{observed}} in daylight with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a <b>high</b> <b>altitude,</b> the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption characterized by interactions between lava and ice, often under a glacier. The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high latitude and <b>high</b> <b>altitude.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} subglacial volcanoes that are not actively erupting often dump heat into the ice covering them, producing meltwater. This meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous jökulhlaups (floods) and lahars.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures are {{relatively}} cold for its latitude {{due to the}} cold Malvinas Current and the <b>high</b> <b>altitude.</b> For example, in Tierra del Fuego temperatures are colder than at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since they {{are influenced by the}} cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the lower}} {{atmospheric}} pressure at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes,</b> the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower {{than it would be}} at low altitudes in order for inhalation to occur.

5|$|When {{the news}} of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a {{telegram}} to Bohr asking {{him to come to}} Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and <b>high</b> <b>altitude,</b> they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.|$|E

The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at <b>high</b> <b>altitude.</b>|$|E
