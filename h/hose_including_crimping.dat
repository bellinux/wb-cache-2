In the UK and other countries, the oxygen hose is blue (black hoses may still be found on old equipment), and the acetylene (fuel) hose is red. If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel, such as propane, is used, the fuel hose should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG.

50|$|Dantec’s FIRESAFE hose is fire {{resistant}} for {{in excess of}} 30 minutes at temperatures up to 1,200 °C. It is designed to carry highly flammable liquids in environments where there is increased risk of explosion.FIRESAFE is made {{of a series of}} specially designed ceramic cloths and heat reflective films which counter the radiant heat effects of fire. This construction allows vapour to burn off slowly as the increased heat of the liquid inside the hose vaporises and seeks to escape.

This construction retains the advantages of composite <b>hose</b> <b>including</b> flexibility and durability.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} tendon {{is dependent on}} the interaction of structural molecules that constitute the extracellular matrix. However, {{little is known about the}} role of elastic fibers that are present in this structure. Elastase treatments have been used to elucidate the mechanical role of elastic fibers in numerous tissues. Here, we show that a standard elastase treatment affects the mechanical properties of tendon, including the ultimate tensile strength and failure strain. Moreover, elastase-treated specimens exhibit significant structural and compositional changes <b>including</b> <b>crimp</b> undulation and release of glycosaminoglycans. These data demonstrate that a common elastase treatment has a complex digestion profile that influences the structure-function relationship of tendon. Thus, defining the mechanical role of elastic fibers in tendon using this technique is challenging. This introduces new and exciting questions regarding the function of elastic fibers in tendon, which may not be as well understood as previously thought...|$|R

40|$|Conference paperA {{finite element}} based micro-mechanical {{methodology}} for cyclic plasticity and fatigue crack initiation in cardiovascular stents is presented. The methodology {{is based on}} the combined use of a (global) three-dimensional continuum stent-artery model, a local micromechanical stent model, the development of a combined kinematic- isotropic hardening crystal plasticity constitutive formulation, and the application of micro- structure sensitive crack initiation parameters. The methodology is applied to 316 L stainless steel stents with random polycrystalline microstructures, based on scanning electron microscopy images of the grain morphology, under realistic elastic-plastic loading histories, <b>including</b> <b>crimp,</b> deployment and in-vivo systolic-diastolic cyclic pressurisation. Identification of the micro- mechanical cyclic plasticity and failure constants is achieved via application of an objective function and a unit cell representative volume element for 316 L stainless steel. Cyclic stent deformations are compared with the J 2 -predicted response and conventional fatigue life prediction techniques. It is shown that micro- mechanical fatigue analysis of stents is necessary due to the significant predicted effects of material inhomogeneity on micro-plasticity and micro-crack initiation...|$|R

50|$|With water troughs {{having been}} removed after the {{withdrawal}} of mainline steam, trains must now stop for water, being refilled via hoses from road going tankers (preferred over static hydrants due to pressure inconsistencies {{and the possibility of}} contamination), although main line water cranes do still exist in some places.With the locomotives often away from their home base, or even any kind of operating base, support crews numbering around half a dozen people usually travel with the train, their role being to prepare the locomotive, tend to it on water stops and repair any fixable issues arising, and clear the ashpan as part of a disposal routine {{at the end of the}} day. As a result, as well as the passenger coaches, main line steam trains will also feature a support coach, normally a passenger brake van of the British Railways Mark 1 or Mark 2 era, specially fitted out to provide seating/sleeping, catering and workshop facilities for the support crew, plus space to carry spares and equipment (i.e. <b>hoses),</b> <b>including</b> that required for the modern equipment needed on a main line equipped train. While on the move, one support crew member rides on the footplate, to act as the locomotive owner's representative and assist the train crew - who have general knowledge of steam locomotives and the UK mainline - by offering specialist knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of the specific locomotive, and reacting to matters arising. On the move, the remaining crew in the support coach will also record the locomotive's performance while operating, including punctuality and fuel efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate whether it may be feasible to simultaneously mix and retrieve radioactive waste slurries that are stored in million-gallon, double-shell tanks at the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington. Oscillating mixer pumps, located near the floor of these tanks, are used to mobilize and mix the slurry prior to retrieval. Operational scenarios that may be beneficial for retrieval may require simultaneous operation of a decant/transfer pump and the jet mixer pumps. The effects of jet-induced agitation and jet impingement upon the decant/transfer pump's flexible suction hose have not previously been experimentally evaluated. Possible effects of the jet impacting the <b>hose</b> <b>include</b> <b>hose</b> fatigue, hose collision or entanglement with other structures, and induced static and dynamic loads on the decant/transfer pump equipment. The objective of this work was to create operating conditions in a test tank that produce a dynamic response (in the flexible suction hose upon impingement from an above-floor jet) {{that is similar to}} that anticipated in the actual tank. A scaling analysis was conducted to define the interactions between the jet, the tank floor and the suction hose. The complexity of scaling the multi-layer flexible hose (matching its hydroelastic parameters at full and 1 / 4 -scale) led to an alternate approach, that of matching the expected full-scale forces on the full-scale hose in the scaled tank. Two types of tests {{were conducted}}: characterization of the jet velocity profile in the test tank at two axial locations from the nozzle and observation of the motion induced in the flexible retrieval hose from impact by the jet. The velocity profile of the jet in the test tank was measured to compare the measured profiles with profile predictions for an above-floor jet. These data were used to obtain a refined estimate of the velocity profile and therefore, the force acting upon the test article at a particular location in the tank. The hose motion and location within the test tank resulting from jet impingement were recorded by video. This visual record can be correlated with the data recorded by the data acquisition system. These data coupled with the velocity profile results, were used to estimate the forces required to induce motion in the hose...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} pinning on the flexural properties, fatigue life and failure mechanisms of carbon/epoxy laminates. Five-harness satin weave carbon/epoxy laminates were reinforced in the through-thickness direction with different volume fractions and sizes of fibrous composite pins. Microscopic examination of the laminates before flexural testing revealed that the pins caused considerable damage to the microstructure, <b>including</b> out-of-plane <b>crimping,</b> in-plane distortion and breakage of the fibres {{and the formation of}} resin-rich zones around each pin. The pins also caused swelling of the laminate that reduced the fibre volume content. Despite the damage, the pins did not affect the flexural modulus of the laminate. However, increasing the volume content or diameter of the pins caused a steady decline in the flexural strength and fatigue life, which appear to be governed by fiber rupture on the tensile side of the laminate. Property changes are discussed in terms of transitions in the dominant failure mechanisms due to the presence of pins...|$|R
