5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] is the twenty-seventh {{and final}} {{episode of the}} second season of the American {{television}} medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and the show's 36th episode overall. Written by Shonda Rhimes and directed by Mark Tinker, the episode was originally broadcast with [...] "Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response", in a two-hour season finale event on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on May15, 2006. Grey's Anatomy centers around {{a group of young}} doctors in training. In this episode, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and her fellow interns <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> a prom for Dr. Richard Webber's (James Pickens, Jr.) niece Camille Travis (Tessa Thompson). Further storylines include Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) recovering from his gunshot wound and Denny Duquette's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) death following his seemingly successful heart transplant surgery.|$|E
500|$|Both the {{physical}} appearance {{and behavior of}} Henry and Sam were designed to reflect that of Joel and Ellie; the backpack and jeans worn by both duos reflect {{the physical}} resemblance, while the behavioral resemblance was {{in that they are}} both forced to make tough decisions over time. After Brandon Scott was chosen to portray Henry, the team only showed him some artistic sketches of the game, avoiding specific details about the story. Scott enjoyed portraying the character, particularly {{due to the fact that}} he was allowed to introduce elements of his own personality. [...] "You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> ... because you get to just be the character," [...] Scott said. He also felt that recording the voice and actions simultaneously was [...] "exciting" [...] and helpful. The team felt that Henry's actions are dedicated to protecting Sam, and that Scott introduced that dedication to the character. Druckmann stated that Henry and Sam's relationship mirrored that of Joel and Ellie's. Ellie was seen by the team as a mentor to Sam. Johnson felt that Sam was [...] "genuinely scared", admiring this significant difference from the game's other characters.|$|E

60|$|Carl {{was still}} out for football, but he was rather light for a team largely {{composed}} of one-hundred-and-eighty-pound Norwegians. He had a chance, however. He drove the banker's car two or three evenings a week and cared for the banker's lawn and furnace and cow. He still boarded at Mrs. Henkel's, as did jolly Mae Thurston, whom he took for surreptitious rides in the banker's car, after which he wrote extra-long and pleasant letters to Gertie. It was becoming {{harder and harder to}} write to Gertie, because he had, in freshman year, exhausted all the things one can say about the weather without being profane. When, in October, a new bank clerk stormed, meteor-like, the Joralemon social horizon, and became devoted to Gertie, as faithfully reported in letters from Joe Jordan, Carl was melancholy over the loss of a comrade. But he strictly confined his mourning to leisure hours--and with books, football, and chores for the banker, he was a busy young man.... After about ten days it was a relief not to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> letters to Gertie. The emotions that should have gone to her Carl devoted to Professor Frazer's new course in modern drama.|$|E
6000|$|The Utopia of {{a modern}} dreamer must needs differ in one {{fundamental}} aspect from the Nowheres and Utopias men planned before Darwin quickened {{the thought of the}} world. Those were all perfect and static States, a balance of happiness won for ever against the forces of unrest and disorder that inhere in things. One beheld a healthy and simple generation enjoying the fruits of the earth in an atmosphere of virtue and happiness, to be followed by other virtuous, happy, and entirely similar generations, until the Gods grew weary. Change and development were dammed back by invincible dams for ever. But the Modern Utopia must be not static but kinetic, must shape not as a permanent state but as a hopeful stage, leading to a long ascent of stages. Nowadays we do not resist and overcome the great stream of things, but rather float upon it. We build now not citadels, but ships of state. For one ordered arrangement of citizens rejoicing in an equality of happiness safe and assured to them and their children for ever, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> [...] "a flexible common compromise, in which a perpetually novel succession of individualities may converge most effectually upon a comprehensive onward development." [...] That is the first, most generalised difference between a Utopia based upon modern conceptions and all the Utopias that were written in the former time.|$|E
6000|$|In {{dragging}} the reader thus {{for a moment}} behind the scenes, I am departing from a rule which I have hitherto imposed on myself so rigidly that I never permit myself, even in a stage direction, to let slip a word that could bludgeon {{the imagination of the}} reader by reminding him of the boards and the footlights and the sky borders {{and the rest of the}} theatrical scaffolding, for which nevertheless I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> as carefully as if I were the head carpenter as well as the author. But even at the risk of talking shop, an honest playwright should take at least one opportunity of acknowledging that his art is not only limited by the art of the actor, but often stimulated and developed by it. No sane and skilled author writes plays that present impossibilities to the actor or to the stage engineer. If, as occasionally happens, he asks them to do things that they have never done before and cannot conceive as presentable or possible (as Wagner and Thomas Hardy have done, for example), it is always found that the difficulties are not really insuperable, the author having foreseen unsuspected possibilities both in the actor and in the audience, whose will-to-make-believe can perform the quaintest miracles. Thus may authors advance the arts of acting and of staging plays. But the actor also may enlarge the scope of the drama by displaying powers not previously discovered by the author. If the best available actors are only Horatios, the authors will have to leave Hamlet out, and be content with Horatios for heroes. Some of the difference between Shakespeare's Orlandos and Bassanios and Bertrams and his Hamlets and Macbeths must have been due not only to his development as a dramatic poet, but to the development of Burbage as an actor. Playwrights do not write for ideal actors when their livelihood is at stake: if they did, they would write parts for heroes with twenty arms like an Indian god. Indeed the actor often influences the author too much; for I can remember a time (I am not implying that it is yet wholly past) when the art of writing a fashionable play had become very largely the art of writing it [...] "round" [...] the personalities of a group of fashionable performers of whom Burbage would certainly have said that their parts needed no acting. Everything has its abuse as well as its use.|$|E

The existence of such a conflict-free set of plans can be ensured if each agent is allowed to reserve time slots on the infrastructure resources it intends to use. In the multi-stage variant of the context-aware routing problem, each agent has a sequence of destination locations it must visit. A naive approach to solve the multi-stage variant is to make context-aware route plans between every two subsequent locations in the sequence, and then <b>to</b> concatenate these <b>plans</b> together.
