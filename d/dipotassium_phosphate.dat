Eight infants were given either Addiphos or <b>dipotassium</b> hydrogen <b>phosphate</b> alternately for 48 hour periods and similar amounts of calcium and phosphorus were delivered. There {{were no significant}} differences in calcium and phosphorus intake, calcium and phosphate plasma concentrations, or acid-base state between study periods on the two solutions. Seventeen infants were given the two solutions alternately for 72 hour periods; Addiphos was used to increase the amounts of calcium and phosphorus being delivered. Calcium and phosphorus intake was decreased on <b>dipotassium</b> hydrogen <b>phosphate,</b> but Addiphos significantly increased calcium and phosphorus intake and plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations. It also lowered the pH of the urine and raised the titratable acidity. Acid-base state, however, was not significantly different.

40|$|Abstract- Exo-polysaccharides like dextran {{produced}} by Weissella sp. {{have a wide}} range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical and other industries. This biopolymer and its derivatives like iron dextran, clinical dextran are rapidly emerging as a new and industrially important products. Dextran a polymer of glucose is produced using sucrose rich media with nitrogen source. It also requires efficient micronutrients and macronutrients for production. In the present study diverse micronutrients (chlorides) like ferric chloride, cupric chloride, magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, calcium chloride, cobalt chloride, mercuric chloride (sulphates) like ferrous sulphate, copper sulphate, magnesium sulphate, manganese sulphate, zinc sulphate, calcium sulphate, potassium hydrogen sulphate and macronutrients (<b>phosphate)</b> like <b>dipotassium</b> hydrogen <b>phosphate,</b> potassium dihydrogen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, calcium phosphate, aluminium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and zinc phosphate were screened using statistical design like Plackett-Burman.

The results indicated that there was higher dextran production in chloride micronutrients like magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, sulphate micronutrients like magnesium sulphate, manganese sulphate and macronutrient like <b>dipotassium</b> hydrogen <b>phosphate.</b> These studies indicate that micronutrients and macronutrients significantly influence dextran production.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} production medium in solid state fermentation for production of xylanase using Brevibacillus borstelensis MTCC 9874. The organism was isolated from Morang district of Nepal and it was grown for 96 h in five different mineral salt solutions (MMS) with rice husk and MSS- 1 was selected as a medium for further study based on xylanolytic activity measured using DNS method. Plackett Burman design (Minitab 15. 1) was done with six variables viz. <b>dipotassium</b> hydrogen <b>phosphate,</b> rice husk, sodium chloride, magnesium sulphate, sodium carbonate and calcium chloride.
