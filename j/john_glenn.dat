5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the village center, NY31 and NY370 split, with NY31 {{retaining}} the Genesee Street name and heading northeast towards Oneida Lake. NY370, meanwhile, travels southeast on Salina Street, loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward Syracuse. The route intersects NY631 before leaving Baldwinsville and heading into another rural section of Lysander. This open stretch ends at the canalside hamlet of Cold Springs, which serves as the beginning of the Syracuse suburbs. After passing through the community, NY370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of Salina. Not far from the canal is a junction with <b>John</b> <b>Glenn</b> Boulevard, a four-lane arterial connecting NY370 to Interstate690 (I-690).|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2016, the Ohio General Assembly {{passed a}} bill to rename the airport from Port Columbus International Airport to its current name, in honor of {{astronaut}} and four-term U.S. senator <b>John</b> <b>Glenn.</b> The name change was unanimously approved by the airport's nine-member board on May 24, 2016. Ohio Governor John Kasich signed the bill into law on June 14, 2016 with the name change becoming official 90 days later.

5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa.

Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E

5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused of {{corruption}} in 1989, igniting a major political scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), <b>John</b> <b>Glenn</b> (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|When NASA {{was created}} that same year, the Air Force program was {{transferred}} to it and renamed Project Mercury. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard Freedom7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight. <b>John</b> <b>Glenn</b> became the first American to be launched into orbit, by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962, aboard Friendship7. Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator <b>John</b> <b>Glenn,</b> the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services. They were concerned about information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E

5|$|Cordray {{was raised}} in Grove City, Ohio, where he {{attended}} public schools. While attending Grove City High School, Cordray became a champion {{on the high school}} quiz show In The Know and worked for minimum wage at McDonald's. He {{graduated from high school in}} 1977 as co-valedictorian of his class. His first job in politics was as an intern for United States Senator <b>John</b> <b>Glenn</b> as a junior at Michigan State University's James Madison College. Cordray earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and graduated summa cum laude with a BA in Legal & Political Theory in 1981. As a Marshall Scholar, he earned an MA with first class honours in Economics from Brasenose College, Oxford and earned a Varsity Blue in basketball in 1983. At the University of Chicago Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor with honors in 1986, he served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review. After starting work as a law clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court, he came back to his high school to deliver the commencement speech for the graduating class in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, {{the same way he}} had sounded out <b>John</b> <b>Glenn</b> a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E
