25|$|Alan Lomax foresaw that {{computers}} {{would be an}} ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to {{people of all ages}} and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an <b>interactive</b> <b>multi-media</b> computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance. Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.|$|E

People at the station and viewers were asked to provide images of themselves, which were then animated primarily at the mouth: viewers phoned in to the show and could then be these characters. The action was a mix of improvisational performance and storylines which Williams created (along with secondary, non-interactive characters.) M.

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of Schenkerian theory in the US, Great Britain, and mainland Europe in the past quarter century, the pedagogy of Schenkerian analysis has become an important issue. Schenker himself was suspicious of textbooks with their tendency for artificial codification and over-simplification; rather, he recognized that his “New Teaching” (“Die neue Lehre”) – {{as he called it}} – required a different, more “organic” pedagogical approach that was both personal and yet accessible to a wide audience. New digital technologies and the Internet now have made it possible to disseminate Schenker’s pedagogical approach by adapting interactive techniques of Web-based instruction. Schenker’s “new teaching” was as organic as his theory itself – and as novel in the connections it sought to draw between the individualed disciplines of theory, musicology, composition, and performance. The <b>interactive</b> and <b>multi-media</b> components of Web-based instruction enable us to realize Schenker’s own pedagogical approach to Schenkerian analysis instruction...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of users {{as well as their}} demand for more and richer con-tent has led to an exponential growth of Internet traffic for more than 15 years. In addition, new applications and use cases have changed the type of traffic. For example, social networking enables users to publish their own content. This user generated content is often published on popular sites such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Another example are the offerings of <b>interactive</b> and <b>multi-media</b> content by content providers, e. g., Google Maps or IPTV services. With the in-troduction of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) protocols in 1998 an even more radical change emerged because P 2 P protocols allow users to directly exchange large amounts of content: The peers transfer data without the need for an intermediary and often centralized server. However, as shown by recent studies Internet traffic is again dominated by HTTP, mostly at the expense of P 2 P. This traffic growth increases the demands on the infrastructure components that form the Internet, e. g., servers and routers. Moreover, most of the traffi...|$|R
