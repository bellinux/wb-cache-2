30|$|Citizen science {{projects}} can {{be classified}} into different types depending on several factors. For example, Roy et al. (2012) derived different clusters of citizen science projects based on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> on two dimensions. The first dimension accounted for the degree of mass participation (i.e. mass participation projects versus local monitoring projects), while the second dimension was interpreted as the degree of investment (i.e. investment of project managers, investment of background information and supporting material, and the time-investment of the participants). In this paper, we follow a similar thinking process in terms of classifying different types of citizen surveillance into a two-dimensional system. However, we specifically focus on the quantitative characteristics of the citizen-sourced data, {{because they are more}} relevant with respect to choosing an analysis method.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{their own}} {{learning}} styles can assist students {{as they relate to}} one another and ultimately to their future clients. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the preferred learning and personality styles of a convenience sample of Central Michigan University students enrolled in the following health-related professions: Athletic Training, Communication Disorders, Social Work, and Physician Assistant. Method: Students completed two self-administered online instruments used to measure learning styles, the VARK and the online version of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter II (KTS-II). Associations between VARK learning style scores and the online Keirsey Temperament Sorter II results were also examined. Results: Seventy-four percent of the students scored as Guardians (Sensing-Judging) based on the online KTS-II report and 62 % were multimodal learners on the online version of the VARK. Conclusion: This study confirmed previous findings that Guardian is the preferred temperament type on the MBTI/KTS-II for health professions students. Average scores on the VARK and the Keirsey did not differ between the various health-related disciplines; however, students scoring as Idealists (Intuition/Feeling) on the Keirsey had significantly higher Aural scores on the VARK when compared to those with Guardian temperaments. There was no significant difference found between Keirsey groups and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> on Vark-V (Visual), R/W (Read/Write), or K (Kinesthetic) learning style dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{investigate}} different types of feedback {{and how they are}} used in schools, and to see which of them are preferred when it comes to error correction. Feedback is used in schools every day even though {{it is difficult to know}} if students really learn from it. Students tend to only glance briefly at the paper or test when it is returned and then throw it away. They are interested in <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> but not really in how to improve their errors until next time. In this study, students wrote essays which were corrected with four different types of feedback and handed back to the students. The students got a chance to revise them and then the result was analyzed. The students were also given a questionnaire in order for me to find out what kind of feedback they liked the most and compare it to the result of the essay corrections. The different feedback types worked well with different students in general, although, underlining with description did not only work best, it was also chosen as the best type by most students. They seemed to think that this type was good for learning something from the feedback. Most students wanted to look for errors themselves instead of getting the correct answer from the teacher...|$|E

50|$|According to Isabel Briggs Myers, a person's {{decision-making}} process depends {{to a significant}} degree on their cognitive style. Myers developed a set of four bi-polar dimensions, called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The terminal points on these dimensions are: thinking and feeling; extroversion and introversion; judgment and perception; and sensing and intuition. She claimed that a person's decision-making style correlates well with <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>score</b> on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would {{tend to have a}} logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style. However, some psychologists say that the MBTI lacks reliability and validity and is poorly constructed.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{performance}} assessment tasks has {{increased over the}} years because some constructs are best assessed in this manner. Though there are benefits to using performance tasks, there are also drawbacks. The problems with performance assessments include scoring time, scoring costs, and problems with human raters. One solution for overcoming the drawbacks of performance assessments {{is the use of}} automated scoring programs. There are several automated scoring programs designed to score essays and other constructed responses. Much research has been conducted on these programs by program developers; however, relatively little research has used external criteria to evaluate automated programs. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate two popular automated scoring programs. The automated scoring programs were evaluated with respect to several criteria: the percent of exact and adjacent agreements, kappas, correlations, differences in score distributions, discrepant scoring, analysis of variance, and generalizability theory. The scoring results from the two automated scoring programs were compared to the scores from operational scoring and an expert panel of judges. ^ The results indicated close similarity between the two scoring program regarding <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> the essays. However, the results also revealed some subtle, but important, differences between the programs. One program exhibited higher correlations and agreement indices with both the operational and expert committee scores, although the magnitude of the different was small. Differences were also noted in the scores assigned to fake essays designed to trick the programs into providing a higher score. These results were consistent for both the full set of 500 scored essays and the subset of essays reviewed by the expert committee. Overall, both automated scoring programs did well judged on the criteria; however, one program did slightly better. The G-studies indicated that there were small differences among the raters and that the amount of error in the models was reduced as the number of human raters and automated scoring programs were increased. ^ In summary, results suggest automated scoring programs can approximate scores given by human raters, but they differ with respect to proximity to operational and expert scores, and their ability to identify dubious essays. ...|$|E

Second, respondents likely vary in <b>how</b> <b>they</b> distribute <b>scores.</b> For instance, some respondents will label a score as important, whereas others will label the same score as very important. Third, workers may over or underestimate their own skills, jobs tasks and job match, e.g. be ‘overconfident’.

All of the models stand in a runway lineup with Heidi Klum in the center, while the designers sit on the ground floor facing them. The models appear by wearing the same outfit (barefoot and a short black shift dress). The sequence by which designers select models is based upon <b>how</b> high <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> during the preceding episode's design competition as well as random pick from a bag: The winning designer has first pick, the runner-up selects second, the lowest-scoring designer picks last, etc. Because there is one more model than the number of designers {{at the beginning of the}} selection process, one model remains unpicked at the end, and will be sent home.

So if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Chemistry) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. When am I {{ever going}} to use this???? (Pleacher, 1998) Many {{students}} ask themselves this question throughout grade school, high school, and college during math class. A scientist knows the answer, but a non-scientist may feel that math classes are {{a waste of time}} (Angel and LaLonde, 1998). There exists a correlation between math and science; that is why those who struggle with math do not pursue the sciences. Through years of data, the strongest evidence in how a student will perform in their college chemistry class is <b>how</b> well <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> in their high school math courses and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> performed on the math portion of their SATs (Andrews and Andrews, 1979). Fifty percent of freshman chemistry students drop out or fail chemistry; these students switch to non-science majors or drop out of college altogether (Angel and LaLonde, 1998). Often times these dejected students pursue a liberal studies degree and in turn teach elementary school, teaching math. If these teachers never saw the connection between math and chemistry, <b>how</b> can <b>they</b> help their students understand when they are going to use the math they are learning? (Worthy, 1982) Something must be done to stop this cycle. Sources of Data: The practices and attitudes to math related chemistry questions by 376 science-major students enrolled in an undergraduate chemistry course at California State University, Sacramento, were characterized by an introductory math quiz and survey. An additional survey and a sequence of worksheets were administered throughout the course and responses to the worksheets and worksheet related exam questions were analyzed. Conclusions Reached: Students should have the option to complete mathematic worksheets that refresh their math knowledge and help them solverelated math questions on their chemistry exams. Students??? academic performance is enhanced by the use of worksheets that aid the practical application of mathematics to chemistry education. Chemistr...|$|R

If the same approach were used for drugs used in ulcerative colitis to quantify an advance over conditions existing at the time of its introduction <b>how</b> would <b>they</b> <b>score?</b> Because <b>they</b> were the first available drugs in their class and clearly constituted major advances, corticosteroids and sulphasalazine both score 95, the score being limited by a high level of side effects.

Steroid foams also score 80, particularly if the patient's vote is taken into account.

40|$|We test {{experimentally}} {{an explanation}} of over and under confidence as motivated by (perhaps unconscious) strategic concerns, and find compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis {{in the behavior of}} participants who send and respond to others' statements of confidence about <b>how</b> well <b>they</b> have <b>scored</b> on an IQ test. In two-player tournaments where the highest score wins, one is likely to enter at equilibrium when he knows that his stated confidence is higher than the other player's, but very unlikely when the reverse is true. Consistent with this behavior, stated confidence by males is inflated when deterrence is strategically optimal and is instead deflated by males and females when hustling (encouraging entry) is strategically optimal. This behavior is consistent with the equilibrium of the corresponding signaling game. Based on the theory of salient perturbations, we propose a strategic foundation of overconfidence. Since overconfident statements are used in familiar situations in which it is strategically effective, it may also occur in the absence of strategic benefits, provided the environment is similar...|$|R
40|$|Scores on the Massachusetts Teacher Tests {{of reading}} and writing are highly unreliable. The tests' margin of error is close to double to triple the range found on {{well-developed}} tests. A person retaking the MTT several times could have huge fluctuations in their scores even if their skill level did not change significantly. In fact, the 9 to 17 point margin of error calculated for the tests represents more than 10 percent of the grading scale (assumed to be 0 to 100). The large margin of error means there is both a high false-pass rate and a high false-failure rate. For example, a person who received a score of 72 on the writing test could have scored an 89 or a 55 {{simply because of the}} unreliability of the test. Since adults' reading and writing skills do not change a great deal over several months, this range of scores on the same test should not be possible. While this test is being touted as an accurate assessment of a person's fitness to be a teacher, one would expect the scores to accurately reflect a test-taker's verbal ability level. In addition to the large margin of error, the MTT contain questionable content that make them poor tools for measuring test-takers' reading and writing skills. The content and lack of correlation between the reading and writing scores reduces the meaningfulness, or validity, of the tests. The validity is affected not just by the content, but by a host of factors, such as the conditions under which tests were administered and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were <b>scored.</b> Interviews with a small sample of test-takers confirmed published reports concerning problems with the content and administration...|$|R
