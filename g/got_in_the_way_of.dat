25|$|In a 1998 Harvard Law Review {{article by}} Michael Heller, {{he noted that}} {{after the fall of}} Communism, in many Eastern European cities, {{there were a lot of}} open air kiosks but also a lot of empty stores. Upon investigation, he {{concluded}} that because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space, it was difficult or even impossible for a startup retailer to negotiate successfully for the use of that space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the effective use of space.|$|E
25|$|Hitler's {{interest}} in this strategy forced Göring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to Göring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, Directions for operations against the British War Economy, which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but Operation Eagle Attack and the following Battle of Britain had <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures.

25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as he walked out of the arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E

[...] The conductor and critic Trevor Harvey wrote in The Gramophone, however, that studio recordings could never recapture the thrill of Beecham performing live in the concert hall.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett had a {{tendency}} to avoid using chapters, arguing in a Book Sense interview that [...] "life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and Homer did not write in chapters", adding [...] "I'm blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults." [...] However, there have been exceptions; Going Postal and Making Money and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters. Pratchett offered explanations for his sporadic use of chapters; in the young adult titles, he said that he must use chapters because ' editor screams until [...] does', but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary 'stopping point' that <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the narrative.|$|E
50|$|Apparently, Allingham {{intended}} Abbershaw {{to be the}} hero/sleuth of {{this book}} and any future mysteries.

500|$|The {{style of}} Love in Several Masques, along with The Temple Beau (1730), {{exemplified}} Fielding's understanding of traditional Post-Restoration comedic form. Albert Rivero, a critic specialising in early 18th-century literature, believes that Fielding, in the play, [...] "recognizes {{that to have}} his plays acted at Drury Lane, he must have the approval of his famous contemporary [...] To gain that approval, Fielding must follow Cibber—if not write like him, certainly write plays that he will like." [...] However, Fielding did not respect Cibber's abilities, nor did he believe that the control Cibber took over the plays performed at the Theatre Royal were improved by Cibber's required changes. Instead, Fielding believed that Cibber <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> comedy. Regardless, there are similarities between the characters in Love in Several Masques and Cibber and Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Husband. In particular, Fielding's Lady Matchless resembles the character Lady Townly.|$|E
500|$|The Eliot Spitzer {{political}} surveillance controversy (popularly {{known as}} [...] "Troopergate") broke out on July 23, 2007, when New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office admonished Spitzer's administration for ordering the State Police to create special records of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno's whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City. A New York Times editorial suggested that Maloney {{might have been}} involved by withholding emails during the investigation, and the Times endorsed Maloney's 2012 election opponent because of its concerns about Maloney's handling of the investigation. The Wall Street Journal wrote in July 2012, [...] "generally, {{those involved in the}} investigation on both sides defend Mr. Maloney's conduct. Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff at the time, Steve Cohen, called the idea that Mr. Maloney <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the Attorney General's inquiry 'misinformed {{to the point of being}} laughable.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea behind}} using the sex gas came from Chibnall, but he {{admitted}} to having [...] "genuinely no idea where the episode came from". Davies stated [...] "when we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're {{going to do the}} sex monster." [...] He also emphasised that the episode is not solely about [...] "having a laugh" [...] with the sex gas, as it also has [...] "something to say about the world". The scene where Carys walks down the street featuring sex in advertisements and couples kissing in public was one of Davies' favourite scenes in the episode, as it explores how [...] the Western world is. The episode was originally much lighter in tone, however, the majority of the comedic moments had to be cut on the final script, as they <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the plot. Also, Carys was originally meant to have two or three boyfriends, but because of scheduling restrictions, there could only be one. This ended up being beneficial to the episode, as it made it more emotive. There was a scene that would be filmed with Carys and a second boyfriend, but that would be cut and added on the deleted scenes on the DVD boxset of the first series.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All we <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E
500|$|Phil Gallo of Variety called Veronica Mars [...] "the smartest teen-oriented drama since Freaks and Geeks". He enjoyed Bell's acting, {{describing}} her [...] "as charismatic {{as she is}} tough and intelligent, giving a multilayered perf that touches on simple 17-year-old insecurity and convincingly incorporates deeper issues concerning family, love and disappointment." [...] Gallo discussed the pilot's reliance on flashbacks and voiceover, and felt that neither <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the storytelling or felt too obvious. He praised Thomas' writing of the [...] "fine script" [...] and Piznarski's directing. Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Veronica Mars was more akin to Buffy Summers than Nancy Drew, with [...] "sharp wits, steely nerves and a wicked sense of humor". Bianco praised Bell's portrayal of the character, saying [...] "whether you buy the idea of teen crime-solvers or not, there's no questioning Bell's credentials as a TV star." [...] Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the pilot was [...] "showing signs of being network television's next Buffy", emanating from a tough, emotionally battered heroine. McFarland found the acting to be fantastic, and said that Bell and Colantoni [...] "create a wonderful father-daughter dynamic". Samantha Bonar of the Los Angeles Times thought that the writing was clever, and praised Bell ability to channel charisma, smarts and frustration.|$|E

500|$|This already {{applied at}} the top: the {{constitution}} contained an age-requirement {{for the members}} of the Uitvoerend Bewind, which favored the election of staid Patriot regents, and discriminated against the more talented [...] "young Turks" [...] that were appointed Agents, like Jacobus Spoors, Gerrit Jan Pijman and Isaac Jan Alexander Gogel. The tenor of the Bewind became more conservative in the ensuing years. The agents went to work energetically, however, and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country, in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure. The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces: Amstel (Amsterdam and immediate vicinity), Texel (the northern peninsula) and Delf (the southern part); and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities, like Overijssel and Drente into Ouden Yssel, and Frisia and Groningen into the Eems department. The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies (hence the small Amstel department with its large population). The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799. But, of course, such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas. In any case, the new local and departmental administrations, though elected, were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government. As the elections often put people in power who represented the old order (like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel) this was exceedingly unlikely. To put it differently, the political effort to attain [...] "national unity" [...] through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions of all stripes, <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the effort to create an efficient national unitary state, as envisioned by Gogel.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> allowing the player to tell {{what was going on in}} the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E
