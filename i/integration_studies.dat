40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} an <b>integration</b> <b>study</b> {{which combines}} Data Mining (DM) and Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS). This study, {{as a new}} paradigm for DM/ABMS, is concerned with two approaches: (i) applying DM techniques in ABMS investigation, and inversely (ii) utilizing ABMS results in DM research. Detailed description of each approach is presented in this paper. A conclusion and the future work of this (<b>integration)</b> <b>study</b> are given at the end...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between attachment styles and majority members' attitudes towards adaptation strategies of immigrants. A second purpose was to determine the construct validity and the stability of the Attachment Styles Questionnaire. A group of 177 first-year psychology students (Study 1), and a more representative group of 260 trust in others, adults (Study 2) filled Out the questionnaire about attachment, model of self, and attitude towards adaptation strategies of immigrants. During the follow-up, roughly one year later, both groups filled Out the attachment styles questionnaire a second time. In addition, the students answered the questions about the adaptation strategies. The construct validity and stability of the Attachment Styles Questionnaire were satisfactory. Furthermore, the secure attachment style appeared to be positively related to the attitude towards <b>integration</b> (<b>Study</b> 2). Fearful attachment was positively associated with the attitude towards assimilation (Study]), and negatively with the attitude towards <b>integration</b> (<b>Study</b> 2). Dismissive attachment was negatively related to <b>integration</b> (<b>Study</b> 1) and positively to separation (Study 2). The preoccupied attachment style appeared to be positively related to marginalization (Study 1). Moreover, the attachment styles predicted-to some extent-the attitudes towards adaptation strategies of immigrants over a period of roughly one year. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The Indian {{state of}} Gujarat is {{forecasting}} {{solar and wind}} generation expansion from 16 % to 32 % of installed generation capacity by 2015. Some states in India are already experiencing heavy wind power curtailment. Understanding how to integrate variable generation (VG) into the grid is {{of great interest to}} local transmission companies and India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. This paper describes the nature of a market-based <b>integration</b> <b>study</b> and how this approach, while new to Indian grid operation and planning, is necessary to understand how to operate and expand the grid to best accommodate the expansion of VG. Second, it discusses options in defining a study's scope, such as data granularity, generation modeling, and geographic scope. The paper also explores how Gujarat's method of grid operation and current system reliability will affect how an <b>integration</b> <b>study</b> can be performed...|$|R
