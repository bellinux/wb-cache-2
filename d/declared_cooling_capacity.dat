The cold side temperature (T(c)) and temperature difference between TEC cold and hot sides (DeltaT=T(h) -T(c), T(h) =temperature of hot side of TEC) were used as the parameters. The <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity,</b> junction temperature, coefficient of performance (COP) of TEC and the required heat sink thermal resistance at the TEC hot side were computed. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> could be increased as T(c) increased and DeltaT was reduced. The maximum <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> and chip junction temperature obtained were 207 W and 88 degreesC, respectively. The required heat sink thermal resistance on TEC hot side was 0. 054 degreesC/W. Larger <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> and higher COP could be obtained when the TEC was operated in the enforced regimes (DeltaT< 0). However, TEC performance was restricted by the T(c) values and heat sink thermal resistance at the TEC hot side.

For these cases, the <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> can increase significantly according to the scientific literature. However, current design standards and test methods provide only limited guidance on sizing of radiant floor cooling systems and their associated air systems {{in the presence of}} solar radiation. The goals of this study are to 1) review current radiant surface <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> estimation approaches; and 2) evaluate the impact of solar heat gain on radiant floor <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity.</b> Sensitivity simulation studies were conducted to investigate the influence of window-to-wall ratio, orientation, building aspect ratio, shading options, and floor material shortwave absorptivity.

The configuration of the regenerator material {{is one of the}} important parameters for the improvement of a 4 K-GM refrigerator. This study investigated the effect of the configuration of the regenerator material, specifically its diameter and porosity, on the performance of the cooler. Firstly, the <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> around 6 K was measured for various diameters of lead (Pb) spheres from 0. 06 mm to 1. 18 mm. Because of the larger heat-transfer area and higher coefficient of heat transfer associated with smaller spheres, they show a higher NTU, which improves the efficiency of the regenerator. But smaller spheres also lead to higher pressure drop in the regenerator, and that reduces the expansion work at the cold end. The study confirmed that an optimal diameter exists when the porosity of the Pb-sphere packed bed is kept constant. However, the noted improvement of <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> with change in diameter was not particularly remarkable. Secondly, the effect of the bed’s porosity on the <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> was measured by mixing two different diameters of Pb spheres. The lower porosity regenerators showed an improvement of <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> in some conditions.
