A guided-orientation method based on {{rotating magnetic field}} has prominent advantages on the twin parallel <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> and can apply in twin parallel <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells.</b> In this paper, RMRS, namely Rotating Magnet Ranging system, its operating principle was gave firstly while applied for drilling twin parallel <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells.</b> The rotating magnetic sub was characterized {{by a pair of}} orthogonal magnetic dipoles, and then build the model for positioning the twin parallel <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> Finally, the authors used the Maxwell software to simulate the algorithm based on the scene environment, and then proves that algorithm is correct and useful for guiding the well to drill and keeping the twin wells parallel...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to extended reach, horizontal drilling drastically increases production. In [...] "tight" [...] rock (low permeability) like the Barnett Shale, the gas uses fractures {{to move out}} of the rock and into the wellbore. The fractures may be natural or induced (see below). A <b>horizontal</b> <b>well</b> exposes more rock (and therefore more fractures) to the wellbore because it is usually designed with the horizontal portion of the well in the productive formation.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{very new}} and {{experimental}} method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the [...] "toe" [...] of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>well</b> toward the [...] "heel", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and {{have the advantage of}} not requiring energy to create steam.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been carried out on Formation damage in {{vertical}} wells but less investigation was conducted in <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> this therefore necessitates development of an approximate filtration theory through a compressible cake medium. A mathematical model was developed to describe the mechanisms and processes of filtration into the Formation through a compressible filter cake during drilling of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells.</b> Goodmans integration technique was adopted for the solution taking into consideration the effects of non-linearity and gravity. The result shows that the Cake thickness buildup at different values of constant of non-linearity is very small also depth of invasion was observed to increase at the beginning of drilling and reduced as time went by. The rapid decline in Solid pressure indicates more damage in <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> than other models used for vertical wells. An approximate analytical solution combining both the steady and transient components has been successfully applied to solve the filtration theory equation developed for <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells.</b> The model is easily applicable to estimate important values needed to know the status of the formation during the drilling of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> are {{applicable}} in low- {{as well as}} high-permeability gas reservoirs (Joshi 1991; Weihong et al. 2005). In low-permeability fields, <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> drain larger volumes than vertical wells and provide an alternative way to achieve long penetration lengths to the formation. In addition, they reduce near-wellbore turbulence and enhance well deliverability in high-permeability gas formations (Chaudhry 2003). Nevertheless, well testing analysis in <b>horizontal</b> gas <b>wells</b> is more difficult compared to the vertical gas wells due {{to the complexity of}} mathematical models and assumptions (Joshi 1991).|$|R

50|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>well</b> {{networks}} are basically {{the use of}} long pipes that lead {{in and out of}} the contaminated aquifer or plume used to inject oxidants and extract the treated ground water. Vertical wells networks consist of appropriately spaced injection wells with slightly overlapping radius of influence (ROI) to ensure reagent contact within the vertical and horizontal treatment zone. Injection wells can be permanently installed or be temporarily installed (i.e. by using direct push technology). <b>Horizontal</b> <b>well</b> networks use pipes that are slightly L-shaped at the bottom to inject oxidant and extract treated groundwater horizontally. Horizontal wells are used especially when oxidants need to be delivered to thin layers of saturation.|$|E
30|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> are {{frequently}} used in gas reservoirs {{to enhance the}} production performance by increasing the contact surface of the well with the formation. Although some methods have been presented to evaluate vertical well productivity in tight gas reservoirs, the detailed information regarding <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> {{has not yet been}} deeply addressed. This study uses a modified backpressure test method based on the isochronal test to determine the correct value of the productivity of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> in a pressure-dependent viscosity anisotropic tight gas formation. To use the isochronal test calculations in the modified backpressure test, the “process conversion-flowing pressure correction” approach was used to convert the modified backpressure test process into the isochronal test. The comparison between productivity values before and after correction with the simulation results validates that how this method can successfully estimate the productivity in <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells.</b> We perform a sensitivity analysis on the error between the pseudo-pressure before and after correction and show its variation with porosity, permeability, skin, formation thickness, and temperature. This can be helpful to understand the importance of correcting pseudo-pressure under different conditions. Results validate that the proposed method of productivity analysis is needed for <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> and should be applied especially in low permeable and thin (tight gas) formations to acquire the precise value of productivity.|$|R

40|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> {{can greatly}} {{increase}} the contact {{area of the}} wellbore and the pay zone; so they are commonly applied in oil reservoirs to enhance the production and ultimate recovery of oil and gas, especially, in low permeability formations. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a technique for the interpretation of transient pressure based on dimensionless pressure and pressure derivative. Type curve matching is one of the techniques that can be used to interpret the pressure data of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> in finite reservoirs. Starting from very short <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> to extra-long wells, the pressure behavior of the wells has been analyzed for different conditions. The effect of the outer boundaries of the reservoir on the pressure behavior of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> has been investigated for different configurations. Rectangular shape reservoirs with different dimensions have been used to study the pressure response in the well. Five flow regimes have been observed for regular length horizontal wells; early radial, early linear flow, pseudo radial flow, channel flow or late linear flow, and pseudosteady state flow. Four flow regimes have been observed for the extra-long wells: linear flow, pseudo radial flow, channel flow, and pseudo-steady state or boundary-affected flow. Of course, those flow regimes do not always take place under all conditions. Pseudo-steady state flow is expected to occur after long production time. A pressure drawdown test was solved using the proposed type curve matching technique. The study has shown that the effect of the boundary on the pressure response of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> and the type of flow regimes depend on the length of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wells</b> and the distance to the nearest boundary...|$|R
