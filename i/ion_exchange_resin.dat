25|$|The {{chemistry}} used is {{a variant}} of that described below, as {{it is based on}} sodium hydroxide. However, in a more recent design proposed by Klaus Lackner, the process can be carried out at only 40°C by using a polymer-based <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resin,</b> which takes advantage of changes in humidity to prompt the release of captured CO2, instead of using a kiln. This reduces the energy required to operate the process.|$|E
25|$|Cation {{exchange}} processes {{have previously}} been investigated {{as a potential}} treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resin</b> can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from mine water. Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.|$|E

Spent <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> were retained for eventual recovery of residual plutonium, typically by incineration followed by the aqueous extraction of plutonium from the resultant ash. The elimination of incineration as a recovery process in the late 1980 s and the absence of a suitable alternative process for plutonium recovery from resins led to a situation where spent <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> were simply placed into temporary storage. This report describes the method that Rocky Flats is currently using to stabilize residue <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins.</b> The objective of the resin stabilization program is: (1) to ensure their safety during interim storage at the site, and (2) to prepare them for ultimate shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.

25|$|Ion {{exchange}} chromatography (usually {{referred to}} as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resin</b> that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There {{are two types of}} ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.|$|E

Effect of initial metal ion concentration, agitation time and pH on adsorption capacities of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> {{was investigated in}} a batch mode. The adsorption process, which is pH dependent, shows maximum removal of copper in the pH range 2 - 7 for an initial copper concentration of 10 mg/L.

The batch sorption kinetics have been tested for a first-order, pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic reaction models. The rate constants of adsorption for all these kinetic models have been calculated. Results showed that the intraparticle diffusion and initial sorption into resins of Cu(II) in the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> was the main rate limiting step. The uptake of copper by the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> was reversible and thus has good potential for the removal/recovery of copper from aqueous solutions.

The size of the magnetic oxide can be predetermined depending on {{the choice of the}} particular resin which is again graded according to the channels in the porous resin.

The availability of various <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> commercially were an added attraction to these researchers. However, for the fabrication of metal–polymer composites, a different route has to be adopted.
