Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|E
500|$|After his open-heart {{surgery in}} 1979, {{clinical}} depression and health problems during the 1980s directly affected Steiger's career, {{and he often}} turned to B-movies, low-budget, independent productions and TV miniseries. He admitted that during this period he accepted [...] "everything I was offered", and knew {{that many of the}} films he appeared in were not great, but wanted to demonstrate his strong work ethic despite his issues. He later regretted the poorer films in which he appeared during the 1980s, and wished he had done more stage work. He sank into an even deeper depression when he was not involved in acting, but <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> him more that his acting career had taken {{a turn for the worse}} and was no longer challenging. The major studio producers were wary of his problems and considered him a liability. Steiger spoke about the experience to a younger colleague while advising: [...] "Never tell anyone if you've got heart problems, kid. Never." [...] His reputation as a fine character actor remained intact, and Joel Hirschhorn at the time considered his talent to be [...] "as strong as ever".|$|E

500|$|The burning {{aeroplane}} in the book's opening, and the suspicions {{it immediately}} arouses, quickly introduces {{the problems of}} terrorism and international security. The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at George Bush and Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far from my house, and <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> me that so many people seemed so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> me a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do it when I was your age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E
500|$|... "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] {{was written}} by Dana Gould and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.|$|E

[...] Frank McGuire, the Warriors' new coach, started the season vowing to get the ball to Chamberlain [...] "two-thirds of the time." [...] Sports Illustrated wrote that McGuire's [...] "eventual effect may be to measurably change the {{character}} of professional basketball from the brawling, hustling, cigar-in-the-face and eye-on-the-till game it has been for decades to the major league sport which it longs and deserves to be." [...] He was determined to play Chamberlain every minute of every game; the [...] and [...] center had missed only eight minutes and 33 seconds that season due to disqualification in a game from technical fouls. In three earlier games that week, Chamberlain had scored 67, 65, and 61 points respectively, giving him an already-record 15 times scoring 60 or more points in his career. He was closing in on 4,000 points for the season, needing 237 more; no other player had ever scored 3,000 points at that point. On December 8, 1961, in a triple overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers, he set a new NBA record by scoring 78 points, breaking the record of 71 previously set by Elgin Baylor. Legendary Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn often told the story that after the game, he asked Baylor if <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> him that Chamberlain had an extra 15 minutes to break the record. According to Hearn, Baylor said he wasn't concerned because [...] "someday that guy is going to score 100". Rival center Bill Russell predicted, [...] " [...] has the size, strength, and stamina to score one hundred some night." [...] In a high school game in 1955, Chamberlain had scored 90points in a 123–21 victory.

2500|$|With accompaniment by {{experimental}} rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed [...] "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley {{wrote about}} an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother.

Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression. Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: [...] "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd {{never been able to}} tell him anything. I used that show to pay my last respects."

2500|$|In Xenoblade Chronicles X, she voices Lin Lee Koo, one of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the story. She auditioned and won the role despite the only direction she was originally given was that the video game involved [...] "space travel". Morris sought to preserve Lin's characteristics as strong female figure in her portrayal, describing her as [...] "super smart and very self-reliant... She can cook dinner and also kick your ass." [...] Morris's take on the character did however include using a deeper, older-sounding voice for Lin, partially to accommodate for the age change, and partially because it was believed that Western audiences would find the high-pitched Japanese version [...] "grating". She voiced between 1,600 and 1,800 lines of dialogue for Lin – above average for a video game. In response to a controversy over Lin's bikini costumes being more covered up in the North American and European versions, Morris said that <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> her that Lin was only 13 years old, but sees the censorship more as localization and that it would make the game open up to a wider audience.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} titled One good Arab for The Guardian, Palestinian writer Sharif Nashashibi argues {{the film is}} one in a long {{tradition}} of Western works where Arabs are vilified and Americans are portrayed as heroes, only that this time <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> to add [...] "a token Arab 'good guy'", equating good with pro-American, [...] "to make up {{for the fact that the}} rest of the Arab characters are bad." [...] All other Arab characters in the movie, he says, [...] "are portrayed negatively - from the brutal, hate-filled, anti-western, religiously fanatical terrorists, to the inept, corrupt, heavy-handed, secretive and frustratingly bureaucratic Saudi authorities", as opposed to the [...] "humanity, grief, compassion, determination, ability and patriotism of most of the American characters". He concludes that [...] "The Kingdom perpetuates negative stereotypes for a quick buck and an adrenaline rush, at a time in the world where breeding such ignorance and prejudice has proven catastrophic." [...] He also took issue with what he perceived to be star Jamie Foxx's anti-Arab comments to Jon Stewart on the Daily Show, despite being [...] "treated 'like royalty' in the United Arab Emirates" [...] during the shooting.|$|E

Stiviano (born Maria Vanessa Perez and of African American and Mexican heritage, who had reportedly been dating Sterling while he was estranged from wife Rochelle Stein) after posting an Instagram photo featuring her, former Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson and another woman. Sterling stated that <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> him that she had [...] "broadcast that [...] associating with black people", and {{that he did not want}} Stiviano to bring them to the team's games. The remarks in the tape caused public backlash (including condemnations from many current and former NBA players such as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant); several sponsors also severed ties with the team, among them Kia Motors (for whom Blake Griffin serves as its television spokesperson), State Farm Insurance and Virgin America. Threats of boycotts against the Clippers were also considered, with the team itself briefly contemplating one of the April 27 playoff game against the Golden State Warriors (the fourth game in the team's first round playoff series) – players opted to protest Sterling's remarks by wearing their shirts inside-out, obscuring team logos.|$|E
