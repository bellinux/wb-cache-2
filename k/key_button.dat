30|$|After {{identifying}} a keystroke, the pre-IME Guard will translate {{it into a}} character. Now we give an example of keystroke translation. For Latin language, every keystroke can directly correspond to a character, but for non-Latin languages candidate words often need to be shown. Here, we only discuss Latin language translation with a qwerty keyboard. Supposing the user types “a” in the soft keyboard, then secure touch screen gets the touch point C(x, y). The preloaded keyboard layout helps the pre-IME Guard determine whether this point falls in the geo range of “a” <b>key</b> <b>button,</b> which {{is defined by the}} top-left point A(x 1, y 1) and the bottom-right point B(x 2, y 2). If it falls in, the pre-IME Guard translate the keystroke as a character “a”.|$|E

40|$|The key {{switches}} of {{the keyboard}} {{of a computer}} system are generally comprised of a key cap having a plunger, conductive rubber disposed above a membrane circuit and compressed by the plunger to trigger the membrane circuit causing it to produce an electric signal to the computer. Some key switches use springs. Some other keyboards use rubber domes or a dome sheet, which do the function of springs. When the user depresses the <b>key</b> <b>button</b> the spring or domes collapse. The key switch depresses the key stem, which actuates the button on the membrane circuit. When the user releases the button the springs or rubber domes push the button up to the rest position. This article illustrates 10 inventions on different key switch mechanism. The inventions are selected from US patent database. The inventions try to simplify the mechanism, reduce manufacturing cost, increase accuracy and reliability, and increase strength and robustness of the keys.

40|$|Laparoscopic jejunostomy in a {{child with}} chronic {{intestinal}} pseudobstruction Li Voti G., Amoroso S.,Milazzo M. Objective os the study: chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction (CIP) is a severe condition characterized by recurrent symptoms of bowel obstruction, {{in the absence of}} lumen occluding lesions. Because of motility disorders, since neonatal age these children show failure to thrive,vomiting,constipation and malnutrition. Long term enteral nutritional support, by gastrostomy or jejunostomy, appears the gold treatment. We performed a laparoscopy assisted jejunostomy in a patient with CIP. Our technique is described and results discussed. Methods and procedures: a 14 years old male child, affected by CIP, was admitted to our unit with severe malnutrition. He had undergone,two years before, a duodeno jejunal anastomosis because of o diagnosis of duodenal compression by superior mesenteric artery. He had no improvement from this operation. Xray study demonstrated a persistent gastroparesis. A short term trial of nasojejunal feeding was effective in weight gain. Because of special anatomical pattern determined from previous operation we performed a laparoscopy assisted jejunostomy and inserted a mic <b>key</b> <b>button</b> for feeding. A 5 mm laparoscopic camera poprt was placed through the umbilicus, by an open access. Two further 5 mm ports were placed in the left lower quadrant and in the cross point of umbilical transverse line and left breast midline. The camera was moved to the inferior port site. Avoding adhesions we managed to find the first jejunal loop. A bowel segment, approximately ten cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, was softly grasped and brought up to the abdominal wall at the left upper port site. Bowel was secured to abdominal wall by few unabsorbable sutures and minimally ostomy was done in order to insert the jejunostomy button. The correct position of the button was checked by laparoscopy. Enteral nutrition restarted via nasojejunal tube 3 days postoperatively and via jejunostomy 8 days later. We observed no intraoperative cpmplications or difficulties because of previous surgery adhesions. Conclusions: laparoscopy assisted jejunostomy is a safe and effective procedure to achieving enteral access in patients with CIP...|$|E

30|$|To {{conclude}} the teeth subject, let me briefly mention on the practical application of teeth. Due to relatively small dimensions of normal teeth, only tusks and ivory of giant animals are widely used. For example, both the Greek and Roman civilizations used {{large quantities of}} ivory to make high value works of art, precious religious objects and decorative boxes for costly objects. Ivory was often used to form the whites of the eyes of statues. Prior to introduction of plastics, it was used for billiard balls, piano <b>keys,</b> <b>buttons</b> and ornamental items. The examples of modern carved ivory objects are small statuary, netsukes, jewelry, flatware handles and furniture inlays.|$|R
