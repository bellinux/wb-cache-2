5|$|In 2004 {{the first}} {{adequately}} large scale {{study on the}} natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or <b>impairments,</b> <b>and</b> 8.3% had died. Severe impairment or death were more likely in those aged over 37 years, male, affected by coma, mental status disorder, intracerebral hemorrhage, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection and cancer. A subsequent systematic review of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that mortality is about 5.6% during hospitalisation and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery.

5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{generate}} knowledge about how teachers relate to students with language impairment in learning situations, with particular focus on working memory. The questions are: What kind of knowledge do teachers have regarding language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory?, What experience do teachers have regarding lack of working memory abilities among students with language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> which consequences do the teachers believe such defects may have for the students? and How can teachers create a learning environment that reduces the working memory demand for students with language impairment? A review of the field shows that there are gaps to fill regarding students with language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory. Language impairment has so far been neglected by researchers and within the public debate. How working memory capacity affects the students has only recently begun to receive attention in school and research. The study was conducted through a qualitative phenomenographical methodology. Structured observations and semi structured interviews have been conducted in primary school classes years 1 - 3. The sample consisted of four teachers at two different schools. The analysis revealed six different themes. Three of them, knowledge of language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory, experiences with language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory and consequences in the learning environment was analyzed, and linked to theories of language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory. The final three themes scaffolding, artifacts and structure were analyzed based on concepts from sociocultural theory and from theories of language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory. The results show that both language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory are perceived as complex concepts that are difficult to define whether teachers have the knowledge and experience or not. The teachers realize that the disability results in social and emotional consequences as well as consequences of learning. The results show differences in how teachers create a learning environment with reduced demands for working memory. The teachers guides students and create structure in the learning environment through various forms of scaffolding and artifacts. The results further show that knowledge and experience of language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory may contribute to the creation of a learning environment with reduced demands for working memory. To create a school for all, knowledge of language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> working memory needs to be spread, relationships between neuroscience and education in schools need to be created and the support from special educators need to be expanded. ...|$|R

25|$|The term Anomic Aphasia usually {{refers to}} {{patients}} whose only prevalent symptom is impaired word retrieval in speech and writing. Typically, the spontaneous speech {{of a person}} with anomic aphasia is fluent and grammatically correct but contains many word retrieval failures. These failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around the intended word, or substituting a different word for the intended word. Anomic aphasia is the mildest form of aphasia, indicating a likely possibility for better recovery. Patients with Broca’s aphasia may also have difficulty with word retrieval, or anomia. In addition, patients with Broca’s aphasia comprehend spoken and written language better than they can speak or write. These patients self-monitor, are aware of their communicative <b>impairments,</b> <b>and</b> frequently try to repeat or attempt repairs. The preceding factors discussed correlate with a good prognosis for patients with Broca’s aphasia. Many patients with an acute onset of Broca’s aphasia eventually progress to milder forms of aphasia, such as conduction or anomic.|$|E

25|$|Pathologically, {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases such}} as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are all characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, cognitive decline, motor <b>impairments,</b> <b>and</b> sensory loss. Collectively these diseases fall within a broad category referred to as proteinopathies, due to the common assemblage of misfolded or aggregated intracellular or extracellular proteins. According to the prevailing amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, the aggregation of amyloid-beta (a peptide normally produced in and cleared from the healthy young brain) into extracellular plaques drives the neuronal loss and brain atrophy that {{is the hallmark of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Although {{the full extent of the}} glymphatic system's involvement in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear, researchers have demonstrated through experiments with genetically modified mice that the proper function of the glymphatic clearance system was necessary to remove soluble amyloid-beta from the brain interstitium. In mice that lack the AQP4 gene, amyloid-beta clearance is reduced by approximately 55 percent.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{factors of}} {{potential}} importance are genetic factors, prior radiation exposure, and previous head injury, such as concussion. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{has been shown}} to be an important and common factor in CNS responses. ApoE controls the redistribution of lipids among cells and is expressed at high levels in the brain. New studies are considering the effects of space radiation for the major isoforms of ApoE, which are encoded by distinct alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4). The isoform ApoE ε4 {{has been shown to}} increase the risk of cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> to lower the age for Alzheimer’s disease. It is not known whether the interaction of radiation sensitivity or other individual risks factors is the same for high- and low-LET radiation. Other isoforms of ApoE confer a higher risk for other diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the ApoE ε4 allele are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, which is also suspected to be a risk increased by radiation. People who carry two copies of the ApoE ε2 allele are at risk for a condition that is known as hyperlipoproteinemia type III. It will therefore be extremely challenging to consider genetic factors in a multipleradiation-risk paradigm.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with stroke, {{physical}} therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved {{by the use of}} ankle foot orthoses. PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise; however, PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting.

Are these distinct disorders? To what extent do they overlap? Which cognitive and linguistic profiles correspond to specific language <b>impairment,</b> dyslexia <b>and</b> comorbid cases? At least three different models have been proposed: the severity model, the additional deficit model and the component model. We address this issue by comparing children with specific language impairment only, those with dyslexia-only, those with specific language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> dyslexia and those with no impairment, using a broad test battery of language skills. We find that specific language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> dyslexia do not always co-occur, and that some children with specific language impairment do not have a phonological deficit. Using factor analysis, we find that language abilities across the four groups of children have at least three independent sources of variance: one for non-phonological language skills and two for distinct sets of phonological abilities (which we term phonological skills versus phonological representations). Furthermore, children with specific language <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> dyslexia show partly distinct profiles of phonological deficit along these two dimensions.
