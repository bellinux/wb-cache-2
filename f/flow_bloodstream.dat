40|$|The {{selective}} sorting of Pb 2 + ions in <b>bloodstream</b> <b>flow</b> {{has been}} carried out via mixed chitosan nano-beads aqua-solution and then selectively sponge up the Pb 2 + ions by a chelating mechanism. To obtain an efficient chelating reaction and a chelating nanobead that can be attracted and separated from the <b>bloodstream</b> <b>flow,</b> a microfluidic component of a microchannel with electrodes has been designed and fabricated by micro-electromechanical process. A local dielectrophoretic force obtained from nonuniform electric fields was elected to manipulate the chelating nanobeads in a continuous <b>bloodstream</b> <b>flow.</b> The experimental studies indicate that the chelating nanobeads undergoes positive dielectrophoresis when suspended in a continuous flow (Re= 5. 0) and exposed to RF/AC fields at 13. 56 MHz frequency. Through this device, the microchannel with electrodes provides a local dielectrophrosis field which is strong enough to manipulate and separate the chelating nanobeads in a continuous <b>bloodstream</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R

AQP 9, an aquaporin membrane channel, has been often linked to the uptake of glycerol in hepatocytes; however, no direct experimental evidence has been provided, yet. Here, we address the question by employing a stopped flow light scattering approach using vesicles of hepatocyte basolateral plasma membrane (BLPM) prepared from mouse livers in various metabolic states.

40|$|Leukocyte {{adhesion}} to the endothelial cells lining {{blood vessel}} walls {{is a central}} event in the body's response to injury or infection. These interactions {{take place in the}} <b>flowing</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> and previous work has shown that fluid flow effects greatly influence the function of the adhesion receptors involved. In these studies, we use a parallel-plate flow chamber and videomicroscopy to quantitate leukocyte adhesion under flow conditions in vitro. First, we report studies of neutrophil adhesion to histamine-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Most neutrophils roll along the HUVECs under these conditions, and a few adhere firmly. The rolling is mediated by P-selectin while the firm adhesion is mediated by β 2 integrins binding to ICAM- 1, and we quantitate these interactions to generate data useful in understanding selectin-mediated rolling and integrin-mediated firm adhesion. Next, we report studies of T lymphocyte adhesion to HUVECs stimulated for 24 hours with interleukin-l (IL- 1). Firm adhesion of T cells in this system is mediated by both ICAM- 1 /αLβ 2 integrin and VCAM- 1 /α 4 β 1 integrin interactions, and we find that initial adhesion and rolling are mediated by a third pathway which does not appear to involve any of the previously characterized adhesion molecules. To investigate the molecular constituents of this pathway, we use a monoclonal antibody approach based on the observation that HUVECs stimulated with both IL- 1 and IL- 4 do not support any adhesion of T cells under flow conditions even though expression of the known endothelial cell adhesion receptors is similar to expression on IL- 1 -stimulated HUVECs. This approach has not yet been successful, and we also report results of preliminary experiments related to possible alternative approaches...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{prepared}} {{on the basis}} of the Standards of the Polish Ultrasound Society and updated based on the latest reports from the relevant literature. The author presents a renal artery examination technique, patient preparation for the testing, limitations of the method, currently recommended proper blood flow standards and criteria for the diagnosis of significant stenoses. Renal artery ultrasound is performed using a  2 – 5  MHz probe, usually a convex 3. 5 MHz one. The ultrasound machine must be equipped with the Doppler options for the evaluation of color coded blood flow and recording of the blood flow spectrum, including the triplex Doppler mode. Patients have to fast for at least eight hours before testing. Ultrasound always begins with the assessment of renal structure using the grayscale. Next, color coded blood flow imaging is used, followed by placing a sampling gate in the lumen of the target vessel to record the spectral image. The aim of renal artery ultrasound is to assess the course and position of arteries, evaluate blood flow parameters, as well as visualize possible changes: stenoses, occlusions, aneurysms, or arteriovenous fistulas. Blood flow velocity is always measured in a longitudinal projection/ longitudinal section of the vessel, after placing the sampling gate in the central part of the <b>flowing</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> which normally corresponds to the central part of the vascular cross-section. When diagnosing renal artery stenosis, it is necessary to know the nature of the blood flow and norms for flow parameters in healthy vessels. The spectrum of the blood flow velocity in renal arteries and their branches is a low resistance one. The following parameters are used to evaluate normal renal arteries and to identify the narrowed ones: Vmax, Vmin, RAR, AT, AI, RI and PI...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{immediate}} and long-term effects of AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy performed in the setting of a percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with those of conventional PTCA in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and angiographic evidence of high intracoronary thrombus burden. BACKGROUND: Plaque rupture, with subsequent exposure to the <b>flowing</b> <b>bloodstream</b> of high thrombotic materials often leads to intravascular thrombosis, representing the main pathophysiological event of acute coronary syndromes. PTCA is the first-choice treatment for these patients in hospitals with cardiac catheterization facilities. However, distal embolization of thrombotic material, fibrin, and other fragments from atherosclerotic plaques might lead to procedural failure. METHODS: Immediate and 1 -year follow-up results of a group of 30 consecutive patients, presenting with AMI and angiographic evidence of high thrombus burden, who underwent rheolytic thrombectomy and PTCA were compared with those of 30 consecutive patients with similar clinical presentation, risk profile, and angiographic picture, and treated with standard PTCA procedure. RESULTS: After the procedure, angiographic analysis showed a higher incidence of final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 in the AngioJet group (93. 3 % vs 83. 3 %, P = 0. 034). In addition, mean corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) was significantly lower in the AngioJet group (22. 4 vs 32. 4, P = 0, 0004). At 1 -year follow-up, patients treated with AngioJet showed a significantly lower incidence of death (3. 33 % vs 13. 33 %,P < 0. 001), major adverse cardiac events (MACE: 10 % vs 30 %, P = 0. 026), and need of revascularization (6. 67 % vs 20 %, P = 0. 013). CONCLUSIONS: Data {{of the present}} study highlight that AngioJet thrombectomy in selected AMI patients at high risk for distal thrombotic embolization results not only in immediately improved angiographic results as compared to conventional PTCA but, indeed, seems to be associated with a significantly better long-term clinical outcome...|$|R
50|$|Although glyceroneogenesis {{was first}} found in adipose tissues, {{it was not}} {{recognized}} in the liver until quite 1998. Glyceroneogenesis was unexpected in the liver for 2 reasons; triglyceride synthesis in liver {{was thought to be}} not natural because gluconeogenesis is taking huge part in the liver, and liver was believed to have sufficient glycerol 3-phosphate collected from the bloodstream. However, several experiments, which used stable isotopes to track the glycerol in liver and bloodstream, showed that 65% of the glycerol backbone of triglyceride <b>flowing</b> though the <b>bloodstream</b> is actually synthesised in the liver. Therefore, glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis in liver was discovered. In fact, liver synthesizes {{more than half of the}} glycerol which mammals need to regulate lipid in their body.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have {{presented}} {{a mathematical model}} to study the evolution, growth and risk rupture of nontraumatic aneurysms contained within a cylindrical region of blood vessels. Analytical and numerical solutions are studied. Results affirmed that the intra-aneurysmal pressure and <b>bloodstream</b> <b>flow</b> account for the evolution and growth of aneurysms, and we find that an aneurysm may rupture when {{the ratio of the}} lateral membrane contraction to longitudinal membrane extension approaches one. Numerical properties of intra-aneurysmal pressure, impact fluid velocity, membrane displacement and the deformed radius with respect to the Poisson ratio, membrane thickness and extensional rigidity are studied. The importance of the findings is rested on the fact that they can be used to improve noninvasive means for predicting aneurysm rupture, and treatment and management decisions after rupture...|$|R
40|$|Background information. Lipolytic glycerol, {{released}} from adipocytes, <b>flows</b> through <b>bloodstream</b> to the liver where its utilization in supplying hepatocyte gluconeogenesis is rate-limited by the permeation step. An aquaglyceroporin expressed in hepatocytes, AQP 9, has been often linked to liver uptake of glycerol. However, the truthfulness of this postulation {{as well as}} the potential existence of additional pathways of glycerol import by hepatocytes have never been assessed directly. Here, we define the identity and extent of liver glycerol transport and evaluate the correlation between hepatic AQP 9 expression and glycerol permeability in AQP 9 +/+ wild type mice in different nutritional states and circulating insulin levels. The liver glycerol permeability of AQP 9 null mice is also assessed. Results. By stopped-flow light scattering, facilitated diffusion of glycerol into hepatocytes was indicated by the low Arrhenius activation energy (3. 5 kcal/mole) and strong inhibition by phloretin, an AQP 9 blocker, that characterized the transport. While fasting markedly increased hepatic AQP 9 a straight parallelism was seen both in quantitative and time-space terms between glycerol permeability and AQP 9 protein in AQP 9 +/+ mice kept in fed or fasted/refed states. In line with these findings, the highest glycerol permeability (Pgly ≈ 14. 0 x 10 - 6 cm/s at 20 °C), at 18 -hours fasting, coincided with the highest percent of phloretin inhibition (63...|$|R

This notion, which relies on collaboration among sensors, reduces false alarms and avoids sending all the sensor measurements back to a centralized processing unit.

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{is a term}} coined to {{describe}} a state in which arterial wall thickens due to the accumulation of fatty materials like cholesterol. Though not completely understood, it is believed to occur due to the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low density lipoprotein. Increase in accumulation of plaque leads to enlargement of arteries as arterial wall tries to remodel itself. But eventually the plaque ruptures, letting out its inner content to blood stream. The ruptured plaque clots and heals and shrinks down as well but leaves behind stenosis - narrowing of cross section. Depending {{on the degree of}} stenosis blood supply from the artery to its respective organ could decrease and even get blocked completely. Frequently, as the vulnerable plaques rupture, thrombus formed as such could <b>flow</b> through <b>bloodstream</b> towards smaller vessels and block them, leading to a sudden death of tissues fed by that vessel. If the plaques do not rupture and artery gets enlarged to a great extent then it results in an aneurysm. Such blockage of coronary arteries in heart can lead to myocardial infarction - heart attack, in carotid arteries in brain can lead to what is called a stroke, in peripheral arteries in legs can lead to ulcers, gangrene (death of tissue) and hence loss of leg, in renal arteries can lead to kidney malfunction. The most disturbing fact about atherosclerosis is the inability to detect the disease in preliminary stages. As stated by Miller (2001), most of the times coronary artery disease (CAD) gets diagnosed only after 50 - 75 percent occlusion of arteries...|$|R

Currently, cancer treatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biological therapy, and targeted therapy. Within the past decade, there has been a huge upsurge in novel ideas and technology to combat this disease. From the 2000 s, the Wiesner lab group has been working on silica-based nanomaterials for cancer “theranostics”. The first generation of Cornell dots (C dots) was fluorescent PEGylated silica nanoparticles used as diagnostic and therapeutic probes in cancer patient care. These particles have already been tested in first-in-human FDA-approved clinical trials, making them the first inorganic-polymer hybrid diagnostic bio-probe to enter clinical trials. They can be injected in the body, <b>flow</b> through the <b>bloodstream,</b> and be excreted without major side effects. The next generation C’ dots have been synthesized in aqueous solution to be even brighter particles than before. Brighter particles allow for clearer visualization in the body, which is especially beneficial when locating, imaging and excising a tumor. This is a valuable component of our particles because it allows for the effective treatment of cancer cells, while allowing healthy, living cells to remain unharmed...|$|R
40|$|Current {{technologies}} for tumor imaging, such as ultrasound, MRI, PET and CT, {{are unable to}} yield high-resolution images {{for the assessment of}} nanoparticle uptake in tumors at the microscopic level 1, 2, 3, highlighting the utility of a suitable xenograft model in which to perform detailed uptake analyses. Here, we use high-resolution intravital imaging to evaluate nanoparticle uptake in human tumor xenografts in a modified, shell-less chicken embryo model. The chicken embryo model is particularly well-suited for these in vivo analyses because it supports the growth of human tumors, is relatively inexpensive and does not require anesthetization or surgery 4, 5. Tumor cells form fully vascularized xenografts within 7 days when implanted into the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) 6. The resulting tumors are visualized by non-invasive real-time, high-resolution imaging that can be maintained for up to 72 hours with little impact on either the host or tumor systems. Nanoparticles {{with a wide range of}} sizes and formulations administered distal to the tumor can be visualized and quantified as they <b>flow</b> through the <b>bloodstream,</b> extravasate from leaky tumor vasculature, and accumulate at the tumor site.

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is a {{commensal}} bacterium {{of the human}} nasopharynx. Occasionally, this bacterium reaches the bloodstream and causes meningitis after crossing the blood–brain barrier by an unknown mechanism. An immunohistological study of a meningococcal sepsis case revealed that neisserial adhesion was restricted to capillaries located in low blood flow regions in the infected organs. This study led to the hypothesis that drag forces encountered by the meningococcus in the bloodstream determine its attachment site in vessels. We therefore investigated the ability of N. meningitidis to bind to endothelial cells {{in the presence of}} liquid <b>flow</b> mimicking the <b>bloodstream</b> with a laminar flow chamber. Strikingly, average blood flows reported for various organs strongly inhibited initial adhesion. As cerebral microcirculation is known to be highly heterogeneous, cerebral blood velocity was investigated at the level of individual vessels using intravital imaging of rat brain. In agreement with the histological study, shear stress levels compatible with meningococcal adhesion were only observed in capillaries, which exhibited transient reductions in flow. The flow chamber assay revealed that, after initial attachment, bacteria resisted high blood velocities and even multiplied, forming microcolonies resembling those observed in the septicemia case. These results argue that the combined mechanical properties of neisserial adhesion and blood microcirculation target meningococci to transiently underperfused cerebral capillaries and thus determine disease development...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is a {{progressive}} arterial disease in which fatty tissue accumulates in the arterial wall. Due to this lipid uptake, the artery thickens and can eventually rupture, causing the lipids to <b>flow</b> into the <b>bloodstream</b> and form blood clots. If this {{happens in the}} carotid arteries, which supply the head with oxygenated blood, a stroke can be the result. If a rupture of an atherosclerotic site, called a plaque, occurs in a coronary artery, a heart attack can be the consequence. If a patient is diagnosed with a rupture prone plaque, several intravascular procedures can be performed to remove the rupture risk. Since current clinical diagnostic tools are of limited value in predicting rupture risk, new methods are being developed. One of those methods is biomechanical modeling of plaques. With the use of Finite Element Analysis, the stresses in the plaque are being calculated and the stress levels are used as indicators of rupture risk. Currently used biomechanical models assume homogeneous material distributions of the materials that {{are present in the}} plaque. However, especially the inner layer of the artery, called the intima, is far from homogeneous in atherosclerotic arteries. Since no previous studies included heterogeneity in plaque stress calculations, the first goal for this study was to create a method in which heterogeneity is included in plaque stress analyses. In stead of using Finite Element software in the conventional way, in which homogeneous sections are created, each individual element has its own material model. Hence, a completely heterogeneous distribution of material properties can be simulated. To validate the method of individually assigning material properties to each element, a comparison between the conventional and the new approach is performed. Since the conventional approach is unable to include heterogeneity, the comparison was performed on homogeneous models. The resulting differences were significantly small enough to validate the new approach and the first research goal is met. The second goal {{of this study is to}} determine the influence of heterogeneity on stress levels in the plaque. For this study, 12 images of plaques were available and for each plaque 100 different heterogeneous stiffness distributions were created. The distributions were based on grayscale values and on stiffness values reported in literature. Besides 100 heterogeneous calculations, also a homogeneous calculation per plaque was performed, to be able to compare the two approaches. It was found that heterogeneity has a large effect on stresses in the plaque. The mean stress of the heterogeneous calculations was generally close to the homogeneous stress, the mean relative difference is 5 ± 15. 8 %. However the variation that was found in the heterogeneous calculations was considerable in each plaque. Standard deviations, relative to the mean, ranged from 14 % up to 75 %. To increase the mechanical knowledge on plaque stress analyses, correlations between stiffness of different locations and stress levels were statistically determined. Although the setup of the study was not ideal for this task, some relations were found. It was found that the stiffness of a thin layer that separates the lipids from the lumen, called the cap, was most influential on the relevant stress levels in the plaque. Since it is currently not efficient to perform a large number of heterogeneous calculations, it would be valuable to be able to predict the range that is introduced by adding heterogeneity to the equation. To accomplish this, correlations between geometrical properties and variation in stress levels were determined. Two relations were found. A larger lumen and a thinner cap lead to more variation. It can be concluded that both goals were met in this study. Heterogeneity is successfully added to biomechanical modeling of plaques and it was found that heterogeneity has a strong influence on stress levels in the plaque.
