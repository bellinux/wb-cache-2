50|$|A <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> <b>marker</b> {{can be used}} as {{they are}} {{convenient}} and tend not to dry up as quickly; marking blue in the form of dye or ink has a tendency to dry in the containers and become unusable quickly. On rough structures, such as castings or forgings, whitewash or a mixture of chalk and water can be used. A solution of copper sulfate, distilled water, and a few drops of sulfuric acid can be used on machined surfaces. This thin copper coating is more resistant to rough handling and the action of cutting fluid.|$|E

I fear being the perennial drop of water, following {{the path of least}} resistance. My working process, as reflected in my work, is a series of personal questions: Am I able to know myself, change myself, resist unwanted change? This series is an effort towards self-determination. The Process and Materials Initially a plethora of impulses, my work is first made actual in the form of small sketches (small inasmuch as 1 l/ 4 " x 3 / 4 " is typical). The media is ideally black fine point pen on white, unlined paper but it is, for the most part, a matter of what is available [...] 68 pencil on old stained receipts, <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> <b>marker</b> on a current nearby calendar, etc. These somewhat ???automatic??? images arise from the insistent, anxious need to express myself and from the innocent, childlike joy of discovery and invention. In the early stages my {{work is a}} kind of semiconscious doodle. (See more in text. ...|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to other}} self-taught artists, Sister Morgan used simple forms {{to depict the}} human figure. Her works are {{characterized}} by their lack {{of the use of}} formal techniques such as perspective and definition of light and shadow, giving them a flat, two dimensional quality. She painted and drew using acrylics, tempera, ballpoint pen, watercolors, crayon, colored and lead pencils and <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> <b>markers.</b> Using inexpensive materials she had at hand, Sister Morgan painted on paper, toilet rolls, plastic pitchers, paper megaphones, scrap wood, lampshades, paper fans and styrofoam trays. The fact that she was self-taught, coupled with her choice of materials as well as her style and subject matter have led her to be characterized as a naive, folk, visionary, vernacular and outsider artist.|$|R
