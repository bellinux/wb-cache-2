25|$|Henry's {{succession}} in 1589 proved <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightforward.</b> He and King Henry III {{were moving}} to besiege Paris {{at the time}} of the latter's death. The city and large parts of France, mostly in the north, were in the hands of the Catholic League, an alliance of leading Catholic nobles and prelates who opposed the Protestant Henry of Navarre as heir to the throne. Instead, they recognized Henry's uncle, Charles of Bourbon, as the heir, and on Henry III's assassination declared Charles king. As a result, Henry IV was forced to fight a civil war in order to assert his position as king, followed by a war against Spain, who continued to question his legitimacy. After the death of Charles of Bourbon, the Catholic League's failure to choose a replacement claimant to the throne, in combination with Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism, led to a general recognition of the king in France. Henry IV's successors ruled France until the French Revolution and the subsequent Bourbon restorations, and they founded dynasties in Spain and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} of the issues {{surrounding}} Socrates’ conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightforward.</b> During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.” Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates’ contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty’s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty’s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty. Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on a few specific occasions. Plato’s Apology has the character of Socrates describe one such instance. He says that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. Socrates simply did not answer this order, while the other four men did go to Salamis to get Leon.|$|E
25|$|The {{extension}} of his estates through the Harthill inheritance was for long uncertain. At {{the death of}} his grandfather, Richard Harthill, there was still a male heir in the family, a ten-year-old grandson called William, who was intended to inherit the majority of the estates. Richard had appointed feoffees to ease the transition, although there were reports that the tenants had no connection with the feoffees and an inquisition post mortem decided that Pooley and the rest ought to escheat to the king during William's minority. In March 1401 an inquiry was held at Tamworth, Staffordshire, into the age of William and it transpired that he was 21, old enough to take over his estates, although he his wardship was still held by Roger Sapurton. Only with the death of William sine prole in the summer of 1402 could it be certain that his aunt Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, would inherit. However, matters were still <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightforward.</b> For example, an inquisition at Tamworth on 10 August found that Elizabeth's stepmother, Mary, was still alive and held a third of the estate at Newton Regis. After the death of Edmund Cokayne in 1403, Elizabeth married John Francis (also rendered Franceys and Fraunceys) of Ingleby, apparently in the same year, She and Francis settled the manor of Harthill on Sir John Cockayne at about the time of their marriage but Elizabeth seems to have been in no hurry to hand over any more of her inheritance to her son. The quitclaim dated 21 April 1416 but issued on 5 May 1417, after her death, listed the manors and properties that made up the Harthill inheritance.|$|E

On the other hand, only a handful of legal theorists are prepared to give up the claim that law presumptively provides its addressees with practical guidance and justification, thereby taking a normative stance by proffering distinctive reasons for action, while conferring rights and imposing obligations.

The empirical evidence leads to my contention that the conditional dimensions presented are <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being <b>straightforward.</b> Points of caution that should be incorporated when interpreting general patterns are discussed. The main argument is that further understanding of the geography of knowledge sourcing may start from generic external factors but contextual sensitivity and analytical interpretations are invariably essential.

40|$|Abstract — Business {{processes}} involve dynamic compositions of interleaved tasks. Therefore ensuring reliable transactional {{processing of}} Web services {{is crucial for}} the success of Web service-based B 2 B and B 2 C applications. But the inherent autonomy and heterogeneity of Web services render the applicability of conventional ACID transaction models for Web services <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being <b>straightforward.</b> Current Web service transaction models relax the isolation property and rely on compensation mechanisms to ensure atomicity of business transactions in the presence of service failures. However, ensuring consistency in the open and dynamic environment of Web services, where interleaving business transactions enter and exit the system independently, remains an open issue. In this paper we address this problem and propose an architecture that supports concurrency control on the Web services level. An extension to the standard framework for Web service transactions is proposed to enable detecting and handling transactional dependencies between concurrent business transactions. We also present an optimistic protocol for concurrency control that can be deployed in a fully distributed fashion within the proposed architecture. We also empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions in terms of throughput and response time...|$|R

A brief overview of the history of anti-trafficking policy and contemporary international measures relating to Swedish legislation on trafficking provides a glimpse into the contested meanings of these measures.

By combining qualitative content analysis and interpretative policy analysis with interviews conducted among practitioners working in this field in a local context, Swedish anti-trafficking policy is explored on different levels. The analysis of the legal Swedish framework and one national anti-trafficking action plan suggests that the Swedish fight against trafficking is strictly interlinked with another fight, one against prostitution. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the theory and practice of this national policy.
