Examples of <b>important</b> <b>questions</b> include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary written sources about Mindaugas {{are very}} scarce. Much {{what is known}} about his reign is {{obtained}} from the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and the Hypatian Codex. Both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of Lithuania and thus have anti-Lithuanian bias, particularly the Hypatian Codex. They are also incomplete: both of them lack dates and locations even for the most important events. For example, the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to Mindaugas's coronation, but failed to mention either the date or the location. Other important sources are the papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of Mindaugas. The Lithuanians did not produce any surviving records themselves, except for a series of acts granting lands to the Livonian Order, but their authenticity is disputed. Due to lack of sources, some <b>important</b> <b>questions</b> regarding Mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered.|$|E

Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most <b>important</b> <b>questions</b> in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E

25|$|Suffrage {{is often}} {{conceived}} {{in terms of}} elections for representatives. However, suffrage applies equally to referenda and initiatives.

25|$|One of the <b>important</b> <b>questions</b> {{in sleep}} {{research}} is clearly defining the sleep state.

The problem of making such a definition is complicated because it needs to include a variety of modes of sleep found across different species.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the medieval period Jämtland's political status is best described as a peasant republic. At Jamtamót disputes were solved and criminals received sentences. The assembly also functioned as some sort of government since it also decided on matters such as taxation. However Jämtland was more of anarchy {{due to the lack of}} a central government administration. All free men were allowed to participate and the most prominent ones from each family, e.g. chieftains deliberated and discussed certain topics among themselves concerning the country. <b>Important</b> <b>questions</b> and issues were however always solved after an assemblage.|$|E

However, MTs directly polymerized at kinetochores might also contribute significantly. The {{manner in which the}} centromeric region or kinetochore initiates the formation of kMTs and the frequency at which this happens are <b>important</b> <b>questions,</b> because this mechanism may contribute not only to the initial formation of kMTs, but also {{to the way in which}} kinetochores correct defective anchoring of MTs and regulate the movement along kMTs.|$|E
25|$|The Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Empire were {{political}} {{institutions in the}} ancient Roman Empire. During {{the reign of the}} second Roman Emperor, Tiberius, the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies (the comitia) were transferred to the Senate. The neutering of the assemblies had become inevitable because the electors were, in general, ignorant as to the merits of the <b>important</b> <b>questions</b> that were laid before them, and often willing to sell their votes to the highest bidder. After the founding of the Roman Empire, the People of Rome continued to organize by Centuries and by Tribes, but by this point, these divisions had lost most of their relevance.|$|E
