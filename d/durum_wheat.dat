5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. <b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
25|$|Pasta: Dried {{pasta with}} three subcategories – (i.) <b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> {{semolina}} pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro), (ii.) Low grade <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) <b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category {{must be made}} only with <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> semolina or <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour {{as part of the}} durum flour.

50|$|Mark Alfred Carleton (Ohio, United States 7 March 1866 - Paita, Peru 25 April 1925) was an American {{botanist}} {{and plant}} pathologist, most notable for his introduction of hard red <b>wheats</b> and <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> from Russia into the American wheatbelt.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1912, {{the village}} of Vanguard, Saskatchewan {{is located in the}} {{southwest}} corner of Saskatchewan on Highway 43 close to Notekeu Creek. It is located in the rural municipality of Whiska Creek. Its prime economic driver is agriculture: chick peas; lentils; red, spring, hard and <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> are grown here.|$|R
25|$|Semolina flour is {{the ground}} {{endosperm}} of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> producing granules that absorb water during heating {{and an increase}} in viscosity due to semi-reordering of starch molecules.|$|E
25|$|<b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> is {{the result}} of the inter-species {{hybridization}} of two diploid grass species Triticum urartu and Aegilops speltoides. Both diploid ancestors had two sets of 7 chromosomes, which were similar in terms of size and genes contained on them. <b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> contains two sets of chromosomes derived from Triticum urartu and two sets of chromosomes derived from Aegilops speltoides. Each chromosome pair derived from the Triticum urartu parent is homoeologous to the opposite chromosome pair derived from the Aegilops speltoides parent, though each chromosome pair unto itself is homologous.|$|E

40|$|<b>Durum</b> <b>wheats</b> are {{reported}} to carry leaf rust resistance genes which {{are different from the}} Lr genes identified in Triticum aestivum and very effective against highly virulent races prevalent in the Indian sub-continent (Pasquini et al 1979; Sharma et al 1986; Roelfs, personal communication). These genes can be used to broaden the genetic base of leaf rust resistance in bread wheats. Although successful transfer of genes from <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> have been achieved earlier for the improvement of Triticum aestivum (McIntosh et al 1967; McIntosh and Dyck 1975), an altered expression of some genes due to change in ploidy level has also been reported (Kerber 1983; Dyck 1987). We report here the transfer of resistance from two highly resistant durums CPAN 6051 and CPAN 6073 to a susceptible hexaploid wheat Agra Local and comparison of the hexaploid derivatives with two commonly grown hexaploid wheats...|$|R
25|$|The {{quality of}} the wheat protein gluten. This protein can {{determine}} the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten present in bread wheats enables dough to trap carbon dioxide during leavening, but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of pasta into thin sheets. The gluten protein in <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> used for pasta is strong but not elastic.|$|R
25|$|Special pastas (paste speciali): As Pasta above, with {{additional}} ingredients other than flour and water or eggs. Special pastas must {{be labeled as}} <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> semolina pasta on the packaging completed by mentioning the added ingredients used (e.g., spinach). The 3% soft flour limitation still applies.|$|E
25|$|Hexaploid wheats {{evolved in}} farmers' fields. Either domesticated emmer or <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> hybridized {{with yet another}} wild diploid grass (Aegilops tauschii) to make the {{hexaploid}} wheats, spelt wheat and bread wheat. These have three sets of paired chromosomes, {{three times as many}} as in diploid wheat.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of Cato, basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or semolina, with <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> used {{predominantly}} in the South of Italy and soft wheat in the North.

40|$|Planting date is an {{important}} consideration when growing small grain varieties under reduced water use conditions. The objective {{of this study is}} to document interactions of planting date and varieties grown with a single irrigation near planting. Field studies were conducted at the Maricopa Agricultural Center during the 1988, 1989, and 1990 growing seasons. Six barley, <b>durum,</b> and <b>wheat</b> varieties were compared at four planting dates from November to February. Early November or early December planting dates were optimum. The relative performance of the varieties differed depending on the year and planting date. The highest yielding varieties over most planting dates were Solum and 6 - 39 - 1 - 1 (barleys), Mexicali (durum), and B 85 - 277 A and M 83 - 39 - 18 (wheats). Improvement of barley, <b>durum,</b> and <b>wheat</b> genotypes for reduced water use conditions continues at the University of Arizona, and notable progress in <b>durum</b> and <b>wheat</b> performance has been achieved recently...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{controversial}} hypothesis suggesting ancient grains might show lower immunogenic properties {{and therefore the}} possibility to introduce them in the diet of wheat-sensitive people, including celiac patients, was investigated. The immunogenic potential of the ancient <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> Graziella Ra and Kamut was studied by comparison to the durum accessions Cappelli, Flaminio, Grazia and Svevo. Experiments were carried out with two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against α-gliadin peptides p 31 - 49 and p 56 - 75 (the latter containing the overlapping DQ 2 -Glia- 1 and DQ 2 -Glia- 2 epitopes), toxic for celiac patients. For all accessions, a few α-gliadin alleles were also cloned, sequenced and translated into aminoacid sequences. Several aminoacid substitutions or deletions were detected in p 31 - 49, DQ 2 -Glia- 1 and DQ 2 -Glia- 2 epitopes, nevertheless, ELISA constantly showed antibody-antigen positive reactions which led us to suggest that mAbs binding was not apparently affected by polymorphisms. Moreover, a few substitutions were also observed in DQ 2 -Glia- 3 and DQ 8 -Glia- 1 epitopes. Although some DQ 2 -Glia- 1 and DQ 2 -Glia- 2 variants evidenced herein were previously reported to have a diminished or abolished T cell stimulatory capacity, present results cannot confirm that ancient <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> would be less CD-toxic. In conclusion, we strongly advice celiac patients from consuming ancient wheats including Graziella Ra or Kamut...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} plants to exclude sodium from the shoot {{is one of}} the major {{components}} of salinity tolerance. In this study, considerable variability in sodium exclusion within different species is demonstrated. The diploid species T. monococcum revealed a large (50 -fold) variability in sodium exclusion in contrast to T. urartu, which was significantly less variable (10 -fold). These species with the A genome are known to be salt sensitive, whilst T. (Aegilops) tauschii, a diploid species with the D genome, was very salt tolerant, but had only moderate variability in sodium exclusion (10 -fold). The tetraploid species T. turgidum ssp. durum (both cultivated and landraces) and wild emmer T. dicoccoides (all with the AB genome) showed a range of variability in both salinity tolerance and sodium exclusion. The general pattern (from most sensitive and with highest Na+ accumulation) was as follows: durum (cultivated) < durum (landraces) < wild emmer. Cultivated <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> had minimal or no variability, whereas landraces of <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> had greater variability, two excellent genotypes having been identified which combine very low sodium accumulation with very high salinity tolerance. Wild emmer was extremely variable. Hexaploid bread wheat, T. aestivum with the ABD genome, is known to be more salt tolerant, having an effective mechanism for sodium exclusion but only low variability.

25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> breads.|$|E
25|$|Additives in dried, commercially sold pasta include {{vitamins}} and minerals that are lost from the <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> endosperm during milling.

40|$|Barley is {{generally}} thought to require less nitrogen fertilizer than wheat, {{but how much}} less has not been clearly documented. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the nitrogen fertilizer requirements of barley and wheat. A study was conducted at the Maricopa Agricultural Center testing the response of 2 <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> (Kronos and Havasu), 2 bread wheats (Yecora Rojo and Joaquin), 2 feed barleys (Baretta and Nebula), and 2 malting barleys (Conrad and Moravian 69) to 7 rates of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 lbs N/acre). The surface soil was relatively high in nitrate at planting (19 ppm NO₃-N) contributing an estimated 76 lbs N/acre. Maximum yield was obtained at 156 (<b>durum),</b> 147 (<b>wheat),</b> 137 (feed barley), and 127 (malting barley) lbs N/acre. However, since the yield of <b>durum</b> and bread <b>wheat</b> was higher than feed and malting barley, the nitrogen fertilizer per 100 pounds of grain yield was similar for these crop types (~ 2. 37 lbs N per 100 lbs of grain). If the 76 lbs N/a of nitrogen estimated to be available from the surface soil were included, then about 3. 62 lbs of N would have been required per 100 lbs of grain for both wheat and barley. The N requirement reported in this study does not include the extra N potentially needed for wheat to obtain acceptable protein levels.
