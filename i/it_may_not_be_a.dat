500|$|Limited occurrences {{resembling}} CCD {{have been}} documented as early as 1869 and this set of symptoms has, {{in the past several}} decades, been given many different names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease). Most recently, a similar phenomenon in the winter of 2004/2005 occurred, and was attributed to varroa mites (the [...] "vampire mite" [...] scare), though this was never ultimately confirmed. The cause of the appearance of this syndrome has never been determined.

500|$|Dyer {{has also}} argued that {{platinum}} blonde hair became such {{a defining feature of}} Monroe because it made her [...] "racially unambiguous" [...] and exclusively white just as the Civil Rights Movement was beginning, and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture. Banner agrees that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the Civil Rights Movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life Monroe associated with people who were seen as [...] "white ethnics", such as Joe DiMaggio (Italian-American) and Arthur Miller (Jewish). According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in Look in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with African-American singing coach Phil Moore.|$|E

500|$|A {{sedentary}} lifestyle plays {{a significant role}} in obesity. Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work, and currently at least 30% of the world's population gets insufficient exercise. This is primarily due to increasing use of mechanized transportation and a greater prevalence of labor-saving technology in the home. [...] In children, there appear to be declines in levels of physical activity due to less walking and physical education. World trends in active leisure time physical activity are less clear. The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits, while a study from Finland found an increase and a study from the United States found leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly. A 2011 review of physical activity in children found that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> significant contributor.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most authors, Vaughan {{is known}} for {{avoiding}} the clichés of the superhero genre, locating the group in Los Angeles and not the common New York. [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] struck interest mainly because it does away {{with the concept of}} superhero behaviour, such as aliases, uniforms, and team names. At {{the very end of the}} story arc, the Runaways (minus Alex) adopt code names, but later drop them. [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] starts off with four females and two males, which is uncommon in the Marvel Universe (most teams have more males). Furthermore, the children never refer to themselves as [...] "the Runaways"; the group remains unnamed. Despite Vaughan's efforts to break down the superhero clichés within Runaways, Marvel's handbooks and website still refer to the characters by their codenames. Also, Vaughan doesn't focus on an actual genre or tone; despite humour, horror and fantasy are common themes and genres, Vaughan mentions that while <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "mature readers book," [...] his style of writing is also dark, challenging and unpredictable.|$|E
500|$|The oldest (and {{also the}} only) {{manuscript}} {{was written in}} 1762, after Bach's death. The provenance of the cantata is disputed: some suggest that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Bach work because of its [...] "unpretentious" [...] nature {{and the lack of}} authoritative original music, or perhaps it was a transposition of an earlier work. Alternatively, part of the cantata may have been written by Bach, while other parts (likely the choruses and the bass aria) were added or amended by other composers. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, remarks on the stylistic similarity of the text structure to Bach's early cantatas written in Mühlhausen. He also sees similar musical expression to the cantata for the inauguration of a new town council there, Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, written in 1708. While some musicologists assume that it may have been composed for the same occasion one year later, Gardiner proposes that it could either be a still earlier work, or that it [...] "was, at least in part, an apprentice piece written in Weimar under Bach's direct tutelage.|$|E

500|$|In October 2010, Mason {{stated that}} a romantic {{interest}} for Chris could be {{introduced in the}} future. He {{said that it was}} not confirmed, but there was a chance that Chris would find someone. Mason admitted that he would find it [...] "awkward" [...] if he had to perform a male kissing scene. The following year, Mason revealed that the writers had plans for a romance for Chris on their radar and a few weeks later it was announced that Bobby Morley had joined the cast as Aidan Foster, a love interest for Chris. Aidan and Chris formed the serial's first gay couple. Bower called the storyline [...] "a natural progression" [...] for Chris, noting that he needed to meet someone at some stage. Bower told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Chris's romance will be handled in a sensitive way and will be treated within the character. She explained [...] "Chris is a naturally shy person – he is not a person who either flaunts his sexuality or his heart. So it will be done according to that character. And <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> full-on relationship. The character that Bob is playing is older and further down the track with his relationship testing, so it will be a relationship story rather than a gay male romance." [...] Mason said that Chris and Aidan's relationship would have a slow build up.|$|E
500|$|In July 2001, while {{pregnant}} with her third child, Hill unveiled her new material to a small crowd, for a taping of an MTV Unplugged special. An album of the concert, titled MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, was released in May 2002 and featured only her singing and playing an acoustic guitar. Unlike the near-unanimous praise of Miseducation, 2.0 sharply divided critics. AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the recording [...] "is the unfinished, unflinching presentation of ideas and of a person. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> proper follow-up to her first album, but it is fascinating." [...] Rolling Stone called the album [...] "a public breakdown" [...] and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album's title opened Hill up for jokes that she had become unhinged. NME wrote that [...] "Unplugged 2.0 is a sparse and often gruelling listen, but there is enough genius shading these rough sketches to suggest that all might not yet be lost." [...] With the mixed reviews and no significant radio airplay, 2.0 debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, but then quickly fell down the charts and ended up selling less than 500,000 copies in the U.S. Neither the album nor its songs placed in the 2002 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Her song [...] "Mystery of Iniquity" [...] {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance and used as an interpolation by hip-hop producer/songwriter Kanye West for his single [...] "All Falls Down", as sung by Syleena Johnson.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{records for the}} shroud can be separated into two time periods: before 1390 and from 1390 to the present.

Critics point out that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.

2500|$|This {{prohibition}} {{also was}} (and in many circles, still is) commonly understood to disallow operating electrical switches. One reason is that, when actuating electromechanical switches that carry a live current, {{there is always}} the possibility that a small electric spark will be generated. [...] This spark may {{be thought of as a}} kind of fire, although since it is incidental and one does not benefit from it, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Sabbath violation at all. In any case, as science became more advanced, and the properties of fire and electricity became better understood, the former reasoning broke down: fire is a chemical reaction involving the release of energy; the flow of an electric current is a physical reaction. Therefore, some hold that the proper reason it is forbidden to complete electric circuits is because it involves construction or building (i.e., the building and completion of an electric circuit—see above). Rav Aurbach, a leading and widely accepted ultra-orthodox posek declined this argument comparing it to saying that you cannot shut a door, as it will effectively be completing a wall. He wrote, [...] "In my opinion there is no prohibition [...] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of ma'keh bepatish or molid... (However, I [...] am afraid that the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Shabbat, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Shabbat unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kelly {{family was}} linked to A. P. Riker's by marriage. [...] Riker, a customs officer, was John A. Kelly's son-in-law. Members of the Kelly family were {{publishers}} and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coincidence that the agent with whom the Kellys contracted for development of Woodside farmland was a publisher of sheet music, periodicals, and [...] "subscription books" [...] named Benjamin W. Hitchcock. [...] Hitchcock had a flair for publicity and innovative sales techniques. Once the area had been surveyed and 972 plots laid out, he organized excursions from the city, hired brass bands to play, and gave prospects free lunch. The first sales event took place on February 18, 1869. [...] Hitchcock priced empty lots at $300. Employing an innovative sales technique, he sold them on the installment plan. Purchasers made a down payment and owed $10 a month until the note was paid off. [...] He took a 25% commission on each sale. [...] To entice purchasers he sold lottery tickets with first option on choice lots as one set of prizes. [...] Other prizes included option to purchase one of five houses already built on the property. [...] It may have been he or perhaps Kelly who gave the name [...] "Woodside" [...] to the area. [...] A member of the Kelly Family, John A. F. Kelly, had used it in occasional pieces he had written for a local newspaper during the 1850s and 1860s. In 1899 {{one of the original}} purchasers told a reporter than he had bought a lot with a tiny house on it, only 20' wide by 16' deep.
