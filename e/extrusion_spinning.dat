Nanogranules of predominantly sc-PLA are initially formed with rapid quenching in quiescent and shear flow, which developed into microspheres with slow quenching and uniform nanofibrils in elongational flow. While only amorphous or the -form PLLA is formed with the quenched melts and macroscopic fibers, the embedded nanogranules and nanofibrils are highly crystallized with the coexistence of sc-PLA and the -crystals. A 1 D coalescence of nascent sc-nuclei into nanofibrils in elongational flow is preliminarily proposed to explain the structure evolution and the minor reinforcement of the nanofibrils on the macroscopic fibers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe forced reeling of {{silkworms}} {{offers the}} potential to produce a spectrum of silk filaments, spun from natural silk dope and subjected to carefully controlled applied processing conditions. Here we demonstrate that the envelope of stress–strain properties for forced reeled silks can encompass both naturally spun cocoon silk and unnaturally processed artificial silk filaments. We use dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) to quantify the structural properties of these silks. Using this well-established mechanical spectroscopic technique, we show high variation in the mechanical properties and the associated degree of disordered hydrogen-bonded structures in forced reeled silks. Furthermore, we show that this disorder can be manipulated by a range of processing conditions and even ameliorated under certain parameters, such as annealing under heat and mechanical load. We conclude that the powerful combination of forced reeling silk and DMTA has tied together native/natural and synthetic/unnatural <b>extrusion</b> <b>spinning.</b> The presented techniques therefore {{have the ability to}} define the potential of Bombyx-derived proteins for use in fibre-based applications and serve as a roadmap to improve fibre quality via post-processing...|$|E

The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread <b>extrusion</b> <b>spinning.</b> We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex β-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues.

40|$|Introduction * Key Ceramic Technologies * Modules by Microsystems Technology * Adaptive Structures * Conclusions * Acknowledgement The present paper {{considers}} {{the correlations between}} and advanced piezoceramic technologies {{and the development of}} smart devices, microsystems and structures. Bob Newnham proposed the idea of smart materials in the 70 ties. Since that we find research programs focused on systems with embedded actuators, sensors and controller units. Active structures proved beneficial, which for example arises from increased saftey, reduced energy consumption, extended life cycle and unique performance. But as a non-series product they failed often by high production costs. In other words, extension of market share to active structures by commercial applications requires technology chains and designs, which are compatible with mass production. An effective approach to overcome this obstacle might be the use of microsystems / MEMS technology as intermediate step providing pre-integration of active functions. Technological developments of the recent past following the here expressed strategy are summarized in the paper. We tried {{to bridge the gap between}} piezoceramic transducer and smart structure fabrication by qualification and adjustment of high efficient production methods of piezoceramic transducers (<b>extrusion</b> <b>spinning,</b> molding and screen printing), electronic circuits (electronics packaging and electronics production) and structural components (metal die casting).

In the first phase, there was a physicochemical characterization of raw materials to use, in order to verify the presence of bioactive compounds and to define the processing conditions. In the second phase, it was the production and characterization of the substitutes. The parameters of the process that were studied were mixture composition, temperature and <b>extrusion</b> <b>spin</b> speed of <b>extrusion</b> process. So, it was established na array of experimental design with the following limits of variation: temperature T 2 T 3 = 110 - 150 ºC, 10 - 50 % of the sample composition of dwells on tomato, with the remainder of chestnut flour, and spin speed of 100 - 204 rpm. The products obtained were evaluated for color, texture absorption capacity, microstructure and antioxidant activity. The results indicated that the characteristics of extruded depend on the processing temperature and composition of the mixture. Thus, the extruded with highest quantity of dwells were those who absorbed more milk, with low hardness and a lower rate of expansion. The antioxidant activity of the products obtained was maximized for intermediate concentrations (40 / 50 %) of dwells on tomato and processing temperature (120 º to 140 º C).
