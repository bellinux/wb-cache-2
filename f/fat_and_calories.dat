5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> <b>calories</b> but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

Albacore tuna that swim close to the water surface can be higher in fat than tuna caught in deep ocean waters—but they are also lower in mercury content and higher in omega-3 content.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} ethnographic {{material}} {{to challenge the}} taken-for-granted relationship between anorexia <b>and</b> fear of <b>fat.</b> While popular understandings assume anorexia to be an extension of everyday dietary guidelines and a fear of weight gain from foods high in <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>calories,</b> I {{argue that it is}} fear of contamination rather than fear of fat per se that is at issue. Through a critique and extension of Mary Douglas' structuralist typology and Julia Kristeva's embodied theory of abjection, I demonstrate that it is the qualities of certain foods, and in particular their amorphous natures, that render them contaminating. Saturating <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> invisible <b>calories</b> are considered dangerous by people with anorexia because they have the ability to move, seep, and infiltrate the body through the interplay of senses. Foods that transgress conceptual and bodily boundaries are thus to be avoided at all costs, for they have the potential to defile and pollute. In light of the low recovery rates for those with anorexia within Australia (and internationally), the findings of this paper have significant implications for the understanding and treatment of this disorder...|$|R
