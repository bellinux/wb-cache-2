5000|$|In mathematics, <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> is a {{modification}} of Hausdorff dimension and other fractal dimensions which places it in a computability theory setting. There are several variations (various notions of <b>effective</b> <b>dimension)</b> of which the most common is effective Hausdorff dimension. Dimension, in mathematics, is a particular way of describing {{the size of an}} object (contrasting with measure and other, different, notions of size). Hausdorff dimension generalizes the well-known integer dimensions assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, fractal subsets of the plane may have intermediate dimension between 1 and 2, as they are [...] "larger" [...] than lines or curves, and yet [...] "smaller" [...] than filled circles or rectangles. <b>Effective</b> <b>dimension</b> modifies Hausdorff dimension by requiring that objects with small <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff dimension also have large <b>effective</b> <b>dimension,</b> and objects with small <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> have small Hausdorff dimension, but an object can have small Hausdorff but large <b>effective</b> <b>dimension.</b> An example is an algorithmically random point on a line, which has Hausdorff dimension 0 (since it is a point) but <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff dimension 1).|$|E

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} notions of fractal dimension are Hausdorff dimension, developed by Hausdorff (1919), and packing dimension, developed by Tricot (1982). Lutz (2000) has recently proven a simple characterization of Hausdorff dimension in terms of gales, which are betting strategies that generalize martingales. Imposing various computability and complexity constraints on these gales produces a spectrum of effective versions of Hausdorff dimension. In this paper we show that packing dimension can also be characterized in terms of gales. Moreover, even though the usual definition of packing dimension is considerably more complex than that of Hausdorff dimension, our gale characterization of packing dimension is an exact dual of [...] and every bit as simple as [...] the gale characterization of Hausdorff dimension. Effectivizing our gale characterization of packing dimension produces a variety of <b>effective</b> strong <b>dimensions,</b> which are exact duals of the <b>effective</b> <b>dimensions</b> mentioned above.

40|$|Model {{complexity}} is {{an important}} factor to consider when selecting among graphical models. When all variables are observed, the complexity of a model can be measured by its standard dimension, i. e. the number of independent parameters. When hidden variables are present, however, standard dimension might no longer be appropriate. One should instead use <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> (Geiger et al. 1996). This paper is concerned with the computation of <b>effective</b> <b>dimension.</b> First we present an upper bound on the <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> of a latent class (LC) model. This bound is tight and its computation is easy. We then consider a generalization of LC models called hierarchical latent class (HLC) models (Zhang 2002).

We also demonstrate empirically that using <b>effective</b> <b>dimension</b> in place of standard dimension improves the quality of models learned from data.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of retrieving a mean spatial structure of wind speed near a sea surface spatial structure in zones of intensive atmospheric vortices {{action from the}} data of sounding the ocean-atmosphere system in the microwave wavelength range. The method {{can be used for}} vortices with distinct structural parameters – the eye, the eye cloud wall, zones of hurricane and storm winds. Tropical cyclones and polar mesocyclones (Polar Lows) can be in the number of such vortices. The basic idea of the method is that the knowledge of major structural parameters of atmospheric vortices (<b>effective</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the storm and hurricane wind zones, maximum wind speed and <b>effective</b> <b>dimensions</b> of maximum winds) gives a possibility to determine a mean spatial distribution of wind speed near a sea surface in the whole region of vortex action – from the center to periphery.

The <b>effective</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the storm and hurricane wind zones can be determined from the data of soundings not only in the microwave but also in the UV wavelength range.
