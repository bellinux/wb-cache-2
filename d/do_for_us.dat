25|$|Shortly {{before the}} series began, Kansas City Mayor Sly James issued a {{challenge}} to Toronto Mayor John Tory over {{the result of the}} series, stating, “we are going to not lose, so I’m really more interested in what you’re going to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> I will warn you in advance, we have our own maple syrup, so something else maybe.” He wagered a selection of ribs and sauces from three local restaurants, while Tory responded the next day with a wager of three types of Toronto craft-brewed beer.|$|E
25|$|I {{know the}} case is desperate; but, sir, we must either quit the country or attack Mr. Hamilton. No time is to be lost. Were I sure of a reinforcement, I should not attempt it. Who knows what fortune will <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>us?</b> Great things have been {{effected}} by a few men well conducted. Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E

2500|$|Swenson {{described}} financing local agents {{prior to}} the Bolshevik victory: [...] "It had been our custom to pick out a local spot, put a good man in charge there, and finance him against the business he would <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> letting him operate in his own name and extend credit according to his own judgment." [...] According to a Soviet source, Swenson had 16 personal agents and provided financing to an additional 14 independent traders, with a total annual turnover in excess of $1 million.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, (after being ousted {{from the}} crew in 2008), Young Buck entered talks {{to work with}} the label. Buck {{provided}} the update in a recent interview stating, [...] "I'ma be honest with you, finally we're at a point where we're having some kind of negotiations with what they're {{going to be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> at G-Unit." [...] The Nashville, Tennessee native said he was ready to make a return to music, whether a part of G-Unit or not. Young Buck's last album was the 2010 independent release, The Rehab. The negotiations may not lead to a new deal between Young Buck and G-Unit, but the rapper remains optimistic.|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>us?.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Now, saving thus {{comes to}} us by what Christ <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in this world, by what Christ <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as {{suffering}} <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> I say, it {{comes to us}} thus; that is, it comes to us by grace through the redemption that is in Christ. And thus to be saved is called justification, justification to life, because one thus saved is, as I said, acquitted from guilt, and that everlasting damnation to which for sin he had made himself obnoxious by the law.
