Three pan diameters and six <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> sizes were adopted and measurements included the mass loss, oxygen concentration and temperature in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening.</b> A dimensionless <b>horizontal</b> ventilation parameter coupling <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> and pool fire areas was proposed {{to deal with these}} measuring parameters obtained.

40|$|The {{reticulated}} dragonet, Callionymus reticulatus, {{was originally}} described {{based on a}} single specimen, the holotype from Malaga, Spain, south-western Mediterranean, probably collected before 1831. The holotype is now disintegrated; the specific characteristics are no longer discernible. The species was subsequently recorded from several north-eastern Atlantic localities (Western Sahara to central Norway), but missing in the Mediterranean. Specimens of C. reticulatus were observed and collected during two cruises in 2014 and 2016 in the Balearic Islands off Mallorca and Menorca. The collected specimens (8 females) have been deposited {{in the collection of}} the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJ). All individuals of C. reticulatus were collected from beam trawl samples carried out during the DRAGONSAL 0914 in September 2014, and during the MEDITS_ES 05 _ 16 bottom trawl survey in June 2016, on shelf and slope bottoms around the Balearic Islands. Both surveys used a ‘Jennings’ beam trawl to sample the epi-benthic communities, which was the main objective of the DRAGONSAL 0914 and a complementary objective in the MEDITS_ES 05 _ 16. The ‘Jennings’ beam trawl has a 2 <b>m</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening,</b> 0. 5 <b>m</b> vertical <b>opening</b> and a 5 mm diamond mesh in the codend. Trawls had duration of 1 to 3 min of effective sampling (bottom time) at a speed of 2 knots. Catches were sorted out to species and standardized abundances of callionymid species (individuals per 500 m 2) were obtained by calculating the sampled surface (distance covered × beam trawl <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening).</b> Callionymus reticulatus is recorded from the Balearic Islands for the first time; the specimens are described and illustrated. The new record confirms that the species is still extant in the Mediterranean. A key to Mediterranean callionymid fishes is provided to distinguish C. reticulatus from other species of the family in the area. The callionymid fish fauna of the Mediterranean now comprises 11 species, including three Lessepsian migrants originating from the Red SeaVersión del edito...|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of the antennae in this way resulted in a concentration of the radiated energy to a smaller beam, thus resulting in a higher radiated power in the main direction (Effective Radiated Power = ERP), without increasing the transmitter power. The result was a longer range. With the L-version the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> angle of the antenna array remained the same, but the vertical opening angle was reduced (so flatter radiation pattern). Because the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> angle was not changed, the bearing measuring performance was not changed.

40|$|Surface mining-induced {{fissures}} {{formed in}} shallow coal seam mining have serious impact on safety mining and water resources protection. This paper proposes {{a novel approach}} to study the formation mechanism and dynamic development of surface mining-induced fissures in shallow coal seam mining. This approach combines field tests, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations based on the geological condition of shallow coal seam mining in Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine. Two typical surface mining-induced fissures, step-type fissures and collapse-type fissures, are generated in shallow coal seam mining. The fissures with large vertical throw or <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> severely impact water resource protection and surface ecological environment. Surface mining-induced fissures are generated periodically and changed dynamically with the advancing of working face. The vertical throw and <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> of surface fissures are changed dynamically with the movement of loading key strata. The movement forms of loading key strata determine the morphological development of surface fissures. Downward sliding movement of broken rocks causes step-type fissures, while downward rotation movement leads to collapse-type fissures. The degree of the downward sliding and rotation of broken rocks determines the vertical throw and <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> of surface fissures. This paper proposes mining technologies to reduce damaging ground fissures in shallow coal seam mining and analyzes their control effects...|$|R

In these regions with hot, dry climates, traditional architecture was developed using empirical knowledge provided by a combination of passive strategies for thermal control, results of a thorough knowledge of weather conditions. The paper presented in the context of this work is related to an attempt to bioclimatic architectural approach, to reduce the energy consumption of heating and cooling of buildings in these areas, while improving thermal comfort. This approach aims to improve the quality of the built environment by developing a new or updated conceptual model, firstly by enhancing local natural resources, and secondly by processing information through scientific tools [1]. Several variants were examined: dimension of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening,</b> combination with other openings (of ventilation holes in the parts around the central space, and stairwell) and the effect of building materials used in the building fabric.

40|$|In {{the current}} design and {{operation}} of residential houses, indoor humidity is often left unregulated because, unlike temperature, {{it is more difficult}} to sense, quantify, and control. High indoor RH may increase the risk of respiratory problems such as rhinitis and asthma, reduce perceived air quality, propitiate mold growth, and cause building damages. Low indoor RH may cause discomfort due to dryness of nose, eyes and skin. Indoor humidity in each room of multizone buildings depends on the moisture generation by sources, moisture transport by air leakage and ventilation, moisture buffering by indoor finishing materials and furniture, moisture transport through the envelope, and moisture transport between rooms due to interzonal airflows. Most of these aspects have been extensively studied, but the moisture transport due to interzonal airflows through doorways or staircase openings has received less attention. The aim of this investigation is to study the interzonal air and moisture transport through a large <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> in a full-scale two-story test-hut involving buoyancy-driven flows (due to temperature differences only) and combined buoyancy and forced airflows (due to mechanical ventilation). To accomplish this objective, experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed. The main parameters tested are the temperature difference between the lower and the upper rooms, ventilation strategies, ventilation rates and locations of the moisture source. Interzonal moisture exchange and interzonal airflows are analyzed based on two quantities that represent both phenomena, the difference between the average humidity ratios of the two rooms and the interzonal mass airflows, respectively. Experimental and CFD simulation results show that higher interzonal mass airflows and moisture exchanges through the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> are found when the upper room is colder than the lower room, while lower interzonal mass airflows and moisture exchanges occur when the upper room is warmer. Also, it is shown that the mechanical ventilation significantly restricts interzonal mass airflows in comparison with cases without ventilation. Based on CFD results, empirical equations representing the upward mass airflow through the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> are developed at different ventilation rates and ventilation strategie...|$|R
