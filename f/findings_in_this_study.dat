5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E

50|$|Consanguineous marriages, {{or those}} within blood {{relations}} such as {{first and second}} cousins, are considered marriages in biraderi, or brotherhood, within many Pakistani subcultures. Based on reported research, about two-thirds of all Pakistani marriages are within families. Analysis of a Pakistani Health Demographic Survey from 2012 to 2013 showed that women in consanguineous marriages {{are more likely to}} face psychological domestic abuse. However, <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> also reported the prevalence of domestic violence within the larger Pakistani population as well.|$|E
30|$|The {{potential}} effect of confounding factors {{also needs to}} be considered {{in the context of the}} purpose and findings of the experiment.

30|$|Another {{significant}} <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the range}} of variability seen across patients, as well as over time (Figures 3 and 5).

The significant <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> highlighted that the later {{the age at which}} the Korean adoptees were placed, the higher Honesty self-concept scores were. [...] The implications of this study presume that the older in which a child is adopted, the more secure they are in their ethnic identity. Due to a longer amount of time, exposed to their native culture, the longer they had to develop a sense of identity of that culture before their adoptive parents culture.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{looking at}} the genes and {{individual}} proteins that {{play a role in}} primary focal hyperhidrosis, researchers have looked at the patterns of heredity for this trait. In a 2003 study, using multiple families, researchers found that primary focal hyperhidrosis was not a sex-linked gene, since male-to-male transmission was seen in multiple families. Instead evidence supported an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with an incomplete disease penetrance. 21 patients in this study reported a positive family history of hyperhidrosis (62%). Researchers were able to uncover this by creating pedigrees of all the participants in the study. Not every member of the pedigree exhibited forms of hyperhidrosis, which allowed the researchers to track the patterns of inheritance. The <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> indicated that primary focal hyperhidrosis is typically an hereditary disorder.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the section}} on rape, Tardieu also deals with child abuse. According to his numbers over 75% of all the rapes or {{attempted}} rapes tried in French courts were committed against children under 16 years old, {{and most of those}} against girls under 12 years old. Additionally, he noted that incestuous rape was not uncommon (also see Sigmund Freud's Seduction Theory). This topic was also dealt with in a separate paper (Etude médico-légale sur les sévices et mauvais traitements exercés sur des enfants i.e. [...] "A Medico-legal Study of Cruelty and Brutal treatment Inflicted on Children"), published in Annales d'hygiène publique et de médecine légale in 1860). This latter work has been retrospectively recognized to be the first scientific or medical book about child sexual abuse. The <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were later republished in the book Étude sur les Blessures, which was published in 1879, the year of Tardieu's death. In this, his last, book, Tardieu claimed to have been the first physician to publish on this subject. [...] Nonetheless, Tardieu's research on the subject was largely either sharply criticized or ignored by legal authorities and other clinicians.|$|E
5000|$|Exercise {{provides}} {{benefits for}} our bodies, {{but to some}} people, the benefits turn into health hazards. To some exercisers, rigorous physical activity becomes the central aspect of their lives. When a preoccupation with exercise has become routine, a person is considered addicted to exercise or exercise dependent. [...] A study done shows why people may become addicted to exercise, especially running. One of the reasons people become addicted to exercise {{is because of the}} release of mood-enhancing chemicals known as endorphins. [...] Endorphins increase the sensation of pleasure, which is why people feel good about themselves after they exercise. Endorphins are also responsible for the [...] "runner's high." [...] Recent studies have lent weight to the alternative theory that the addictive appeal of exercise is due to the production of endocannabinoids, naturally produced chemicals that bind to the brain's CB1 receptor, rather than to endorphin production. [...] Those who suffer from exercise addiction will go through physical and emotional withdrawals in the absence of exercise, just like a person who is addicted to other substances, such as drugs or alcohol. Although in many cases, running is a better alternative than substance abuse. The <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> conclude that there is a link between negative addiction to running and interpersonal difficulties, which is common in other addictive behaviors as well.|$|E
5000|$|According to Gourdine and Lemmons' study, Perceptions of Misogyny in Hip Hop and Rap: What Do the Youths Think?, {{the youth}} {{population}} is highly affected {{and involved in}} the hip hop and rap music industry. Individuals from ages 18-24 spend a majority of their time listening {{to this type of}} music, so researchers Gourdine and Lemmons conducted this study and found that it was easier to understand youth's perceptions on misogyny by focusing on their listening habits and age. When first conducting this research, it was difficult for youth to express their opinions {{due to the fact that}} they already had a preconceived notion that adults did not support rap music, [...] "the youths expressed concern that there were different genres of hip hop and rap music and that one needed to understand the history of those artists who fell into what they termed conscious and unconscious categorizations" [...] (Gourdine, 2008). The youth admitted that, [...] "Even those youths who embrace the lifestyle agree that the media sensationalizes a way of living that can do harm to their communities" [...] (Brown & Gourdine, 1998, 2001, 2007). After conducting a study amongst 262 individuals in an undergraduate college, the researchers revealed that the youth, [...] "who listened to rap and hip hop music less frequently were more likely to have negative perceptions of and attitudes toward the music, and those who listened more frequently were more likely to have positive perceptions and attitudes…That is, the younger group (18- to 20-year-olds) reported significantly greater scores on the violent-misogyny subscale indicating more positive perceptions and attitudes toward rap and hip hop music than the older group (21- to 23-year-olds)" [...] (Gourdine, 2008). This study came to the conclusion that the younger the individuals listening to this rap and hip hop music, the more likely they did not identify the misogyny that came with this type of music. According to Gourdine and Lemmons, the older the individuals are, the more likely they are mature and disidentify with the harsh words and misogyny against women in rap music. Gourdine and Lemmons suggest that in order to improve the youth's understanding on rap music we must, [...] "monitor the amount of time spent listening to music, which gives youths other alternatives. This study indicates that the younger the youths, the more likely they will listen to rap. This population is college-age, and the maturity factor may have affected the <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> A study looking at younger youths is needed. The opportunity to analyze the music can be useful as well" [...] (Gourdine, 2008).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects on reading achievement for middle school students after participation in a remedial reading program, Xtreme Reading, at a southeastern state public school. The researcher used Stufflebeam 2 ̆ 7 s (2003) context, input, process, and product (CIPP) model to guide the study. A mixed-method research design was used to examine data collected from 80 students in Grades 6 through 8 participating in reading interventions spanning a 1 -year period from 2013 through 2014. There were significant differences in reading achievement scores of students during the 1 -year implementation of Xtreme Reading. The <b>findings</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> reveal that an intensive reading intervention, Xtreme Reading, can significantly improve reading achievement for struggling adolescent readers when implemented with fidelity.
