The rotary kiln is an unlined rotary furnace originally designed to destroy small arms and bulk explosives. The kiln is made up of four 1.6 metre long, 1 metre outer diameter retort sections bolted together. The 6 to 8 cm thick walls of the kiln are designed to withstand small detonations. The kiln contains internal spiral flights, which move the waste in an auger-like fashion through the retort as the kiln rotates. The flights also provide charge separation for the in-process materials, and discourage sympathetic detonations and scattering of materials. The kiln is equipped with a variable speed drive, which allows varying rotation speeds and material residence time.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the applicability of the plasma waste <b>destruction</b> <b>technology</b> to North Carolina hazardous waste streams. This study outlines the current regulations, existing technologies, and innovative technologies being considered as hazardous waste treatment alternatives. From this foundation, the study proceeds to identify the superiority of the plasma waste <b>destruction</b> <b>technology.</b> Specific areas of discussion include: temperature capabilities, waste residence time requirements, destruction removal efficiencies, operational efficiencies, economic issues, safety, and maintenance. This study finds the plasma <b>destruction</b> <b>technology</b> to be fully effective and superior to conventional facilities. The technology completely destroys hydrocarbons and can reduce the volume of many other hazardous wastes on the order of one part per million. The required residence time of waste in a plasma facility for effective destruction is a fraction of a second, while the rotary kiln incinerator maintains an average residence time of approximately 5 seconds. Also mass and heat balance calculations are performed to quantify the effectiveness and efficiency of this technology.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The attacks of September 11 and the recent anthrax cases have heightened long-standing concerns about the {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction. The United States and the international community have undertaken several efforts over the years to secure these weapons and prevent their spread. Today, there is renewed need to maintain strong international controls over such weapons and related technologies, and to reevaluate the effectiveness of the controls. The United States has used the following four key policy instruments to combat the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction: (1) international treaties, (2) multilateral export control arrangements, (3) U. S. export controls, and (4) security assistance to other countries. Each instrument is important to preventing the transfer of weapons of mass <b>destruction</b> and associated <b>technologies</b> to terrorists or rogue states, but each has limitations. International treaties restrict transfers of weapons of mass <b>destruction</b> <b>technologies,</b> but their effectiveness depends on whether treaties can be verified and enforced and whether all countries of concern are members. Multilateral export control arrangements are voluntary, nonbinding agreements under which countries that produce the technologies used to develop weapons of mass destruction agree to restrict the transfer of these technologies. U. S. export controls set the legal and regulatory conditions under which goods and technologies can be exported. Security assistance to other countries helps control or eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and otherwise stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. ...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{progress}} has been made in a wide range of areas which support the continued development of the nitric-phosphoric acid oxidation process for combustible, solid organic wastes. An improved understanding of the overall process operation has been obtained, acid recovery and recycle systems have been studied, safety issues have been addressed, two potential final waste forms have been tested, preliminary mass flow diagrams have been prepared, and process flowsheets have been developed. The flowsheet developed is essentially a closed-loop system which addresses all of the internally generated waste streams. The combined activities aim to provide the basis for building and testing a 250 - 400 liter pilot-scale unit. Variations of the process now must be evaluated in order to address the needs of the primary customer, SRS Solid Waste Management.

ECC utilizes a more dilute OA solution (2 wt%) and an oxalate <b>destruction</b> <b>technology</b> using ozonolysis with or without the application of ultraviolet (UV) light. SRNL conducted tests of the ECC process using actual SRS waste material from Tanks 5 F and 12 H. The previous phase of testing involved testing of all phases of the ECC process (sludge dissolution, OA decomposition, product evaporation, and deposition tank storage) but did not involve the use of UV light in OA decomposition. The new phase of testing documented in this report focused on the use of UV light to assist OA decomposition, but involved only the OA decomposition and deposition tank portions of the process. Compared with the previous testing at analogous conditions without UV light, OA decomposition with the use of UV light generally reduced time required to reach the target of < 100 mg/L oxalate. This effect was the most pronounced during the initial part of the decomposition batches, when pH was < 4. For the later stages of each OA decomposition batch, the increase in OA decomposition rate with use of the UV light appeared to be minimal.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of Cryptosporidiosis through water used for recreational such as swimming pools or spas and drinking purposes has gained much attention {{over the past}} decade. Concerns of Water and Health authorities {{has resulted in a}} number of investigations into, either existing or novel, treatment technologies for reducing the risk of viable and infective Cryptosporidium oocysts being transmitted by water. A technology that emits an electromagnetic field that produces Sweeping Sound Frequencies (low frequency sound waves) through an activator was investigated as a possible method of enhancing existing treatment methods for killing Cryptosporidium parvum. Oocysts were treated in reverse osmosis water, filtered tap water, unfiltered tap water and in pool make-up water with 0, 0. 5 mg/L, 1 mg/L or 3 mg/L free chlorine. Upto 75 % of oocysts in tap water ruptured, with no further treatment after exposure to the sweeping sound system. It was noted that the appearance of the ruptured oocysts was similar to those that would excyst during the in vitro excystation assay (ie. the suture line was opened rather than the wall being destroyed). This may suggest that a physiological trigger was responsible for the oocysts rupturing, rather than physical forces. No obvious effect was noted for oocysts exposed to the sweeping sounds in pool make-up water containing 0, 0. 5 or 1 mg/L of free chlorine. Sixty five percent of oocysts in pool make-up water containing 3 mg/L free chlorine and exposed to the sweeping sound system were rendered non-viable according to the vital dye and in vitro excystation assays. Thus, the use of this sweeping sound technology as a possible <b>destruction</b> <b>technology</b> for potentially viable oocysts and for enhancing the efficacy of water treatment systems contaminated with Cryptosporidium, has potential. The work is continuing to validate the results described here and to understand the mechanisms that might be involved. No Full Tex...|$|E
