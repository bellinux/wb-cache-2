50|$|Historically, the <b>Jipijapa</b> Zone in the {{province}} of Manabí {{has been one of the}} most prominent places in which coffee has been cultivated in Ecuador. In 1860, coffee grains were introduced there. When Ecuador opened up to foreign trade and commerce, significant changes occurred throughout the country with new small plantations reaching a certain degree of development, allowing coffee export for the economic growth of the nation. This phenomenon occurred almost on par with cocoa production.|$|E

50|$|The hats {{are made}} from a type of palm leaf called jipi, named after the town of <b>Jipijapa,</b> Ecuador, which makes a similar hat. The palm leaves are cut while young and unopened to obtain the finest fiber. To prepare the fiber, the leaves are opened and dried in the sun, then {{bleached}} using sulfur. It is important to work the fiber while moist {{so that it does}} not break with the manipulation. During the rainy season, the work is done outdoors but during the dry season, artisans have special humidified rooms, caves and basements for this purpose. The weaving begins {{in the center of the}} top of the head and ends at the brim.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music of}} Ecuador {{has a long}} history. Pasillo is a genre of {{indigenous}} Latin music. In Ecuador it is the [...] "national genre of music." [...] Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, diablada pillareña, capishca, Bomba (highly established in afro-Ecuadorian society {{in cities such as}} Esmeraldas), and so on.Tecnocumbia and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign culturese. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is Sanjuanito. It's originally from northern Ecuador (Otavalo-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a danceable music used in the festivities of the mestizo and indigenous cultures. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by indigenous people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when indigenous people celebrated their rituals of Inti Raymi.The Panama hat is of Ecuadorian origin, and is known there as [...] "Sombrero de paja toquilla", or a <b>Jipijapa.</b> It is made principally in Montecristi, in the province of Manabí and in the province of Azuay. Its manufacture (particularly that of the Montecristi superfino) is considered a great craft. In Cuenca an important Panama hat industry exists.|$|E

40|$|In {{the year}} 2016, {{seventeen}} cultivars of mango (Mangifera indica L.) {{were collected in}} local markets and farmers' field of <b>Jipijapa</b> Canton, Ecuador, {{with the aim of}} describing and analyzing mango fruits due to their morphological characteristics of sugars (°Brix) and total solids. Collections were carried out by stu-dents and teachers of the Research Methodologies course of the Agricultural Engineering Career, of the Southern State University of Manabí (UNESUM). The fruits were characterized by using 16 qualitative and quantitative variables for fruit and seed recommended by UPOV and IPGRI. The percentage of total solids and Brix grades of each harvested crop were also analyzed in the UNESUM bromatology laboratory. Results showed that in the <b>Jipijapa</b> Canton, Ecuador, there is a great biodiversity of native mangoes, which were not characterized. Fruit shapes, pulp color and variable fiber contents were observed. The length of fruit was 6. 33 to 12. 50 cm, and the width was 5. 27 to 8. 50 cm, with a length/width ratio between 0. 77 and 1. 83 cm. The fruit weight was 63. 3 to 500 g. No significant differences were observed in the sugars content (°Brix). Finally, it was observed that the range of consumable pulp was 63 to 94 % in native cultivars and 86 % to 97 % in the improved ones...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the great}} {{economic}} and ecological importance of Ricinus communis. that is having worldwide, like base {{for the production of}} biodiesel and little develop of these culture on a large scale in the country, is important to study the best ecotypes and the most productive in different ecosystems of Ecuador. The present project studied morphometrics characteristics of five ecotypes, of ricinus communis, Guayas (Samborondón), Manabí (<b>Jipijapa</b> y Manta), Imbabura (Ambuqui) y Loja (Quinara) and it had as aim evaluate the variables; height of the plant, diameter of stem, number of leaves and survival, to determine the best one under agro ecological conditions in the Dry Tropical Forest of the province of Guayas. There were proceeded to sow seeds of different ecotypes, where were registered the data the germination and the variable described above. To validate the investigation was used a totally at random blocks design, with three repetitions and five treatments, additionally was take the data of the flowering and the production of the seeds in the cultivation during the time of study, after the analysis of the results was the best ecotype Manabí (Manta) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the tourism}} industry, {{there are new}} trends of tourism {{activities}} and have even developed new concepts which are {{in keeping with the}} contemporary reality of our days. Such is the case of community tourism, which focuses the participation or involvement of indigenous peoples who are in the area of influence from one sector to develop in the industry. The cultural route - gastronomic montubio of <b>JipiJapa</b> - La Pila - Montecristi, is a proposal that fits an entire community of people who have an ancestral identity that originates from the earliest pre-Columbian peoples who inhabited the coast of Ecuador to the present. But now unfortunately many of these people have been abandoning this identity due to migration of them to different cities and counties away. However, although there are some people "montubios" like oases in the desert who have these characteristics in the provinces mentioned above. The project proceeded to conduct a thorough investigation of the origins of identity montubio research using methods consistent with our objectives; this research indicates the result that most people who consider montubios agree with the proposal a route of this nature, others have found a favorable response in the aspect of tourism demand. Therefore we have obtained as a result, our hypothesis is valid because the proposed route may allow the rescue, strengthen and position the cultural heritage - Gourmet montubio community...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in the <b>Jipijapa</b> canton, Manabi province of Ecuador, with the following objectives: i) to identify the dose of humic acid in the caupí crop, ii) to determine the time for foliar application of humic acid, and iii) determine the marginal rate of return in terms of cost/benefit. A plot in experimental design of completely randomized blocks (DCRB) with factorial arrangement of 4 x 3 with four replications was implemented. The variables plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD), sheath length (SL), number of decks (ND) and average weight of decks (AWD) were evaluated. The results showed that to improve cowpea production, the addition of significant amounts of iron is required. The dose of leaf application was 1000 cm 3 /ha of humic acids, the PH was 48. 76 cm and SD of 9. 66 mm. The time for foliar application of humic acids was at 30 days, the length of pod was obtained with 21. 16 cm and numbers of decks with 14. 34. For the weight of the mallets, the treatment was the application to the 15 days after the sowing. There was a high and significant correlation between PH and SD (0. 54). When the economic analysis was carried out, the T 8 treatment, 1000 cm 3 /ha of humic acid was applied, applied 30 days after sowing was the one with the marginal return rate with 271. 43 %...|$|E
