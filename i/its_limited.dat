500|$|Intuition and {{ambiguous}} teaching lead {{students to think}} of the limit of a sequence as a kind of infinite process rather than a fixed value, since a sequence need not reach <b>its</b> <b>limit.</b> Where students accept the difference between a sequence of numbers and <b>its</b> <b>limit,</b> they might read [...] "0.999..." [...] as meaning the sequence rather than <b>its</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R

5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> release, English-language {{copies of}} Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> {{distribution}} and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, {{little is known}} of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E

5|$|During <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> {{use as a}} {{first-class}} cricket ground, only one century was scored on the ground, by Jim Parks. During the 1937 match, he scored 140 runs for Sussex. The most wickets taken by a bowler in a match at West Hendford was achieved in 1938, when Hampshire's Stuart Boyes took twelve wickets, including nine in the first innings. Somerset's only success on the ground was in 1936 against Worcestershire, who they dismissed for 60 runs in the first innings, and 77 in the second.|$|E
5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Bijeljina truth {{commission}} was created with a four-year mandate. It held two public hearings in 2008, but by March 2009, {{although it was}} not formally disbanded, the {{commission was}} effectively dissolved when the majority of its members resigned. A number of factors have been cited as contributing to its failure, such as the inclusion of the commander of the Batković concentration camp in its delegation, <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> legal standing, disputes over the commission's scope, and poor funding.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{external}} studios {{were brought}} in to help complete the project within the short development time. Its announcement was delayed to 2016 due to the early reveal of Final Fantasy XV. Kingsglaive grossed $6.55 million during <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> theatrical run and earned a further $3.9 million from its DVD and Blu-ray releases. Reception to the movie was mixed, with praise going to the visuals and lead actors' performances, while the story and supporting cast were widely criticized.|$|E

5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E

5|$|The adipose fin, {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to <b>its</b> <b>limited</b> function. A 2014 study challenges this idea and suggests that the adipose fin {{is an example of}} convergent evolution. In Characiformes, the adipose fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold, while in Salmoniformes, the fin appears to be a remnant of the fold.|$|E
