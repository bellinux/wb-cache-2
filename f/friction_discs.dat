50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates similar to the {{clutches}} in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> {{is attached to the}} load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.|$|E

40|$|Somewhere in the {{transmission}} of vehicles today, a wet clutch can often be found. Characteristic {{of this type of}} clutch is that they operate under lubricated working conditions. In earlier research, friction characteristics and performance of wet clutches have been well investigated by several authors. Studies have also been made {{in order to understand the}} ageing of wet clutches. However, most lifetime studies have been made for systems with paperbased <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and systems involving sintered bronze <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> remain unexplored. <b>Friction</b> <b>discs</b> of sintered bronze is used in the Haldex limited slip coupling (LSC), an all-wheel drive system used in cars from many different manufacturers. In order to get a better understanding of how this system can change over time, the study in this master thesis is focused on how frictional performance is affected by oxidation of lubricant, testrig ageing and additive content. This work has been conducted in cooperation with Haldex Traction in Landskrona and Statoil Lubricants in Nynäshamn. The oxidation effects on friction performance was examined using a modified dry-TOST (Waterless Turbine Oil Oxidation Stability Test) on a fully formulated lubricant. The oxidation time period was divided into five steps from 48 hours to 408 h and for each level of oxidation, a friction performance test was run using a pin on disc machine. Also an oil aged in a clutch disc testrig was tested for friction performance. The test is constructed in order to verify that an oil- friction disc combination will last the lifetime of the specific application. Since lubricant additives are vital to the performance of wet clutches the effect of reducing the additive concentration in the oil was also studied, in the range 10 to 100 % of the standard additive formulation. Results showed that a general friction increase can be seen for oxidation, additive reduction and testrig ageing. Lubricant aged in testrig shows significantly different friction characteristics with temperature than lubricants aged by dry-TOST implying that dry-TOST alone is not a sufficient method to evaluate lubricant ageing. Further research has to be made in order to understand the ageing of wet clutches. A better understanding of which mechanisms that are responsible for the decomposition of a lubricant in a wet clutch system such as the Haldex LSC is needed.

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} different machinery. Wet clutches and brakes are frequently used to distribute torque in vehicle drive-trains. The clutches can be located in e. g. automatic transmissions or limited slip differentials. Their frictional behavior is of great importance for the overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally investigated in test rigs where complete <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are tested under similar working conditions as for the clutches in the drive-train. However, it is today possible to simulate the clutch behavior and not limited ourselves to only use testings as a help {{in the design of the}} wet clutches. This is an advantage because it is possible to simulate behavior that is not possible to measure in test rigs. Another advantage is the faster and more cost efficient design process than when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque transferred by the clutch during engagement can be roughly divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are in direct contact. The distribution between these two types of torque is different for different types of wet clutches and engagements. When the clutch works in full film regime, it is possible to simulate the friction quite well, whereas the friction in the boundary regime is much more difficult to model and simulate, since it is very additive dependent. The most common use of wet clutches is in automatic transmissions for vehicles. Hence, most research in wet clutch testing and simulations are performed on wet clutches suitable for these applications. Here, the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to standstill and the total engagement will have a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch will be working in full film lubrication. In this investigation, the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions, i. e. the clutches will have a limited slip during a long duration without any lock-up. During this kind of engagement the clutch will work mainly in boundary lubrication and generate much heat. Such clutches can be found in, e. g. limited slip differentials. The optimum when designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch during the whole engagement without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible but an efficient way to design clutches can be obtained by combining fast friction measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this work, a simple friction measurement technique for wet clutches working in boundary lubrication is developed, based on pin on disc measurements. These friction measurements are combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, dependent of the surface groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to allow a wet clutch working in boundary lubrication to be optimized for given working conditions regarding lubricant, friction material and surface groove pattern. The simulations are validated by measured data from a test rig in which whole <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are investigated with the same working conditions. Godkänd; 2006; 20061204 (parmar...|$|E

40|$|In {{industry}} {{today there}} are increasing demands not only on product performance, but also on environmental performance. In striving to develop high performance environmentally adapted products, optimization of product life is a central issue. The success of design optimization relies on {{an understanding of the}} degradation process and of the associated degradation mechanisms. A high level of costs is often associated with downtime of machinery caused by service and by replacement of machine components. Knowledge of ageing mechanisms facilitates evaluation of the remaining useful life, thus optimizing performance during the entire service life of components. In this study the ageing process of wet clutches has been investigated. Wet clutches are used in automatic transmissions and limited slip differentials in private vehicles and are designed to transfer torque. A wet clutch consists of a clutch pack submerged in lubricant. Separator and <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are alternately positioned in the clutch pack. The separator discs are connected to the input shaft and the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are connected to the output shaft. When the clutch pack is pushed together friction is generated between the friction and separator discs. Torque transfer is thus created in the interface between contacting surfaces and torque transfer characteristics are determined by the interaction between lubricant and contacting surfaces. The investigations performed in this thesis have been designed to increase the understanding of wet clutch ageing and failure. Tests have been performed from full scale to model tests. Full scale testing describes the actual system which means that all significant degradation mechanisms are present. The disadvantage with full scale testing is {{that it is difficult to}} separate and isolate degradation mechanisms. In small scale model tests it is possible to isolate the degradation mechanisms and hence also what effects they have. Correlation of results from full scale to small scale can in turn increase the understanding of which degradation mechanisms are important for the system and how they influence the wet clutch system. The wet clutch lubricant and the contacting surfaces provide the friction characteristics of the clutch. Therefore, this work has focused on how lubricant degradation affects friction characteristics and hence wet clutch performance. Results in this study show that friction levels increase as lubricant degradation proceeds. In accelerated wet clutch test rig ageing, results in this study indicate that high temperatures in the interface between contacting surfaces greatly influence wet clutch degradation.

40|$|Human {{civilization is}} {{largely based on}} the {{transformation}} of stored chemical {{energy in the form}} of fossil fuels into usable work through the use of the combustion engine. In recent years, the awareness of problems such as global warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves has increased. New regulations have been put into place in order to limit these effects and as a result, the efforts made by the automotive industry to limit the emissions and fuel consumption of their products has taken a higher priority. Attempting to minimize power losses is one approach taken, where the knowledge of Tribology is often made use of to lower the fuel consumption. In heavy duty equipment such as wheel loaders and articulated haulers, {{a large portion of the}} mechanical power is lost in the transmission. One of the largest contributors to the transmission power losses is the viscous drag in disengaged wet clutches. While the method of reducing these losses are quite clear (e. g. a reduction in clutch size will yield lower losses), the effects of the subsequent increase in power and energy density in clutch engagements are less clear. In this thesis, the effects of increasing the load, i. e. increasing energy input density and power absorption density, on the clutch are investigated. The main concern with increased load on the clutch is the durability of the clutch. In particular, wear of the paper-based friction material lining of the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> has been evaluated, as well as the influence of friction material wear on the clutch performance. A new type of test rig has been developed to quantitatively measure the clutch wear throughout a durability test. The wear measured continuously in the test rig correlates well with verification measurements performed while the engagement behavior could be clearly distinguished through the measured torque transfer. At high energy densities and high power levels, a wear phenomenon was observed where the wear rate suddenly changed. During and after the change there was no significant change in engagement characteristics. However, if a clutch which experiences two different wear rates are to be used in a transmission, it is necessary to accurately model the wear so that a compensation can be implemented in the clutch control system. The model was derived in the form of a wear equation where the clutch pack thickness is described in terms of the number of clutch engagements, employing two different wear constants. Total clutch failure due to wear occurs once most of the friction lining has been removed from the <b>friction</b> <b>discs.</b> Up to that point, the clutch is still able to deliver the required torque transfer granted that the increased distance between discs can be compensated for by smart control of the clutch. Heavy duty wet clutches need to be designed in such a way that maximum power and energy density is achieved without reaching the point where the friction lining is totally removed within the required clutch life. The use of the proposed wear model can aid in the design of new wet clutch systems to minimize the clutch's size without compromising the length of its service life.

When the clutch works in full film regime it is possible to simulate the friction quite well.

To stop the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted in a device called a brake caliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the <b>disc.</b> <b>Friction</b> causes the <b>disc</b> and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|R
30|$|The {{efficiency}} drops {{with increase}} in surface roughness due to surface roughness effect, flow losses and external <b>disc</b> <b>friction.</b> Higher surface roughness helps getting higher head.|$|R
25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on <b>friction</b> between a <b>disc</b> and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create <b>friction.</b> Since braking <b>discs</b> can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|R
40|$|Dymola and Modelica {{have been}} used in {{research}} at KTH Vehicle Dynamics since 2000. With the intro-duction of new templates and standard components, Modelica has become increasingly accessible for researchers and students in the field of vehicle dy-namics and therefore a project was initiated to evalu-ate its usefulness as an educational tool. The general idea is to introduce Dymola in smaller assignments, aiming to familiarise the students with the basic functions of the tool while demonstrating its use through simulation examples. Four exercises were studied: a truck braking system model, a <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> clutch model, a controllable torque clutch model and a combined driver and vehicle model. The conclu-sions from this pilot study were that Dymola offers several ways to enhance the quality of vehicle engi-neering education, mainly due to the ease of model-ling and the rich animation functions which make the simulation exercises more interesting...|$|R
