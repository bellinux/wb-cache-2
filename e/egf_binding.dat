We have examined the action of EGF on breast cancer cells in vitro and characterized the EGF receptor as a model system for its action in vivo. All of the fourteen breast cancer cell lines which grow attached to culture dishes specifically bound EGF, including one purportedly normal breast line (HBL- 100).

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the concave up nature of the Scatchard plot of epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)</b> <b>binding</b> on EGF receptor (EGFR) has been a controversial issue {{for more than a}} decade. Past efforts to mechanistically simulate the concave up nature of the Scatchard plot of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> have shown that negative cooperativity in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> on an EGFR dimer or inclusion of some external site or binding event can describe this behavior.

Here we report the correlation between the number of epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)</b> <b>bindings</b> and the response probability of intracellular calcium elevation. Binding of EGF molecules and changes of intracellular calcium concentration were measured for identical HeLa human epithelial cells. It was found that 300 molecules of EGF were enough to induce calcium response in half of the cells. This number is quite small compared to the number of EGF receptors (EGFR) expressed on the cell surface (50, 000). There was a sigmoidal correlation between the response probability and the number of <b>EGF</b> <b>bindings,</b> meaning an ultrasensitive reaction. Analysis of the cluster size distribution of EGF demonstrated that dimerization of EGFR contributes to this switch-like ultrasensitive response. Single-molecule analysis revealed that EGF bound faster to clusters of EGFR than to monomers. This property should be important for effective formation of signaling dimers of EGFR under very small numbers of <b>EGF</b> <b>bindings</b> and suggests that the expression of excess amounts of EGFR on the cell surface is required to prepare predimers of EGFR with a large association rate constant to EGF...|$|R

Crude membrane preparations from normal and lung-tumor tissue from beagle dogs were examined in a radioreceptor assay, using 125 I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a ligand. Specific <b>EGF</b> receptor <b>binding</b> was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled EGF. We have examined <b>EGF</b> receptor <b>binding</b> in eight lung-tumor samples obtained from six dogs. Epidermal growth factor receptor binding was significantly greater in lung-tumor samples (31. 38 %) compared with that in normal lung tissue (3. 76 %). Scatchard plot analysis from the displacement assay revealed that there was no statistical difference in the binding affinity but significantly higher concentration of EGF-R sites in the lung-tumor tissue (619 fmol/mg) than in normal lung tissue (53 fmol/mg). The increase in EGF-R number in plutonium-induced dog lung tumors does not seem to correlate with increase in the initial lung burden exposure to plutonium.

Due to diminished receptor concentration, hepatic <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> was decreased in male and female lit/lit mice to a level that was unaffected by gender or androgen treatment. GH replacement therapy by intermittent injections and continuous infusion restored the <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> of hypophysectomized mice to normal male and female levels, respectively, suggesting a role for the more pulsatile GH secretion in normal males. In lit/lit mice, however, both continuous and intermittent GH resulted in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> levels comparable to those in normal females.

These similarities suggest that the actions of PDGF on <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> may be mediated by protein kinase C, the cellular effector of PMA. We show that in density-arrested BALB/c 3 T 3 cells PDGF and PMA induce a rapid, transient, cycloheximide-independent loss of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> activity. As has been previously shown for PDGF, the ability of PMA to reduce <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> was enhanced by cholera toxin, a potent activator of adenylate cyclase. In contrast to PMA, however, PDGF induced a further reduction in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> that was strictly dependent upon continued protein synthesis. Furthermore, PDGF effectively reduced <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> in cells refractory to PMA. Cells desensitized to PMA, presumably due to the loss of protein kinase C activity, also remained mitogenically responsive to PDGF.

40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF), {{transforming}} growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), and amphiregulin are structurally and functionally related growth regulatory proteins. These secreted polypeptides all bind to the 170 -kDa cell-surface EGF receptor, activating its intrinsic kinase activity. However, amphiregulin exhibits different activities than EGF and TGF-alpha {{in a number}} of biological assays. Amphiregulin only partially competes with <b>EGF</b> for <b>binding</b> <b>EGF</b> receptor, and amphiregulin does not induce anchorage-independent growth of normal rat kidney cells (NRK) in the presence of TGF-beta. Amphiregulin also appears to abrogate the stimulatory effect of TGF-alpha on the growth of several aggressive epithelial carcinomas that overexpress EGF receptor. These findings suggest that amphiregulin may interact with a separate receptor in certain cell types. Here we report the cloning of another member of the human EGF receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which we have named "HER 3 /ERRB 3.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{epidermal}} growth factor (<b>EGF)</b> <b>binding</b> sites was determined by competitive binding assays {{in a series of}} 46 pituitary macroadenomas. A single concentration of I- 125 -EGF (1 nM) was used for all experiments. In four cases, a displacement curve was obtained by adding increasing concentrations of cold EGF, and Scatchard analysis showed the presence of two classes of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> sites, with K-d 1 = 0. 62 +/- 0. 23 nM and K-d 2 = 53. 8 +/- 8. 2 nM for the high- and low-affinity binding sites respectively. The distribution of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> sites was studied in 42 cases by a single-point assay, in the presence {{and in the absence of}} a 100 -fold cold EGF excess. A non-parametric distribution of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> sites was observed (median 10. 2 fmol/mg membrane protein, range 0. 0 - 332. 0). EGF-receptor positivity, defined as <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> greater than or equal to 10. 0 fmol/mg protein, was observed in 23 samples (54. 8 %), especially in prolactinomas (76. 5 %, P< 0. 05 vs other tumors taken together) and in gonadotrope adenomas (62. 5 %). <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> was higher in invasive than in non-invasive adenomas (median: 12. 8 vs 0. 0 fmol/mg membrane protein, P= 0. 047), and especially in adenomas invading the sphenoid sinus (median 26. 7 fmol/mg membrane protein, P= 0. 008 vs other adenomas). <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> also tended to increase with the grade of supra/extrasellar extension according to Wilson (P= 0. 15). Sex steroid receptors (SSRs) were simultaneously determined in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions of 31 pituitary adenomas. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay and androgen receptors by a competitive binding assay with [H- 3]methyltrienolone. No correlation could be found between <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> and either the gender and gonadal status of the patients, or the expression of SSRs by the adenomas. We conclude that the EGF family of growth factors may play a role in the evolution of a significant subset of human pituitary adenomas, especially in their invasiveness, and that a high <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> capacity may represent an additional marker of aggressiveness for these tumors. Sex steroids do not appear to have a significant role in the regulation of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> in vivo in these tumors...|$|E
40|$|Modifications of {{cellular}} responses to {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) induced by tumor promoters and anti-promoters were examined. The effect of the promoter 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> was studied using mouse epidermal cells. Initially, TPA decreased <b>EGF</b> <b>binding.</b> However, when cells were incubated continuously in TPA plus a low concentration of EGF, more EGF bound to TPA-treated cells than to control cells. It was shown {{that the effects of}} TPA were partially reversible and that the greater amount of EGF bound to TPA-treated cells over controls after long-term incubation was due to larger amounts of whole EGF in the media of TPA-treated cells when cells have regained their ability to bind EGF. The ability of TPA to induce DNA synthesis synergistically with EGF may depend on the transient sparing of EGF from degradation and subsequent binding of the spared EGF. Fluocinolone acetonide (FA) and retinoic acid (RA) are potent anti-promoters able to induce increased <b>EGF</b> <b>binding.</b> The possibility that these compounds exerted their anti-promoting activities through offsetting TPA-induced <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> alterations was studied. Rat- 1 fibroblasts were used to examine the effect of FA on TPA-mediated changes in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> and EGF-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and DNA synthesis. Pretreatment with FA caused increased <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> and decreased ODC activity and DNA synthesis stimulated by high or low EGF concentrations. The glucocorticoid lowered ODC and DNA synthesis induced by EGF in combination with TPA to levels closer to control (EGF alone) levels. These data indicated that the anti-hyperplasiagenic effect of FA may be partially mediated through the EGF receptor. The effects of RA on <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> and EGF-induced cellular responses were examined in Rat- 1 and Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Pretreatment with RA resulted in increased <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> to 3 T 3 cells only. However, RA treatment was able to enhance ODC activity in both cell lines. Retinoic acid binding protein was detected only in Rat- 1 cells. It was therefore unlikely that the effects of RA on ODC induction were mediated by either altered <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> or the presence of CRABP. Experiments with 3 T 3 cells demonstrated that TPA alone was able to induce ODC activity. It is therefore possible that TPA exerts part of its tumor promoting action through the EGF receptor, but other sites of action also contribute to its promoting properties...|$|E

Treatment of 2 C 5 cells with phospholipase C induced ODCase activity and reduced <b>EGF</b> <b>binding,</b> whereas phospholipases A 2 and D were inactive. When sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerols containing fatty acids 3 - 10 carbons in length were added to 2 C 5 cells, those diacylglycerols containing fatty acids 5 - 10 carbons in length caused ODCase induction and reduction in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding.</b> sn- 1, 2 -Dioctanoylglycerol {{was one of the}} most active compounds tested.

The exposed individuals ingested approximately 1 to 3 g PCBs and 5 mg PCDFs, and many exhibited symptoms characteristic of PCB poisoning. This disease was termed "Yu-Cheng" in Chinese. Based on data from experimental animal models, we examined a number of parameters in placentae from control and exposed women, including arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, cytochrome P- 450 isozymes, epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)</b> receptor <b>binding</b> properties and actions, and Ah receptor. We also quantified concentrations of various PCB and PCDF congeners known {{to be present in}} the contaminated rice oil. Our results revealed a dramatic elevation in placental AHH activity in samples from PCB/PCDF-exposed women. This increase in enzyme activity was associated with a parallel increase in placental microsomal protein immunochemically related to cytochrome P- 450 form 6 [derived from 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) -induced rabbit lung]. No other cytochrome P- 450 isozyme was detected in placental preparations, and the form 6 homolog was found only in placentae from exposed women. EGF receptor-mediated autophosphorylation capacity was significantly diminished in PCB/PCDF placentae, but this effect was not associated with changes in plasma membrane <b>EGF</b> receptor <b>binding</b> properties (Kd and Bmax).

To define possible mechanisms for this growth arrest, we determined the effects of ethanol on <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> and EGF receptor (EGF-R) levels. During a 24 -h exposure to ethanol (1. 7 mg/ml, 31 mM), cell replication was completely blocked while <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> per cell doubled. This effect was no specific for EGF, with variable degrees of increased binding noted for insulin, transferrin, and glucagon. Significantly increased <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> was seen after 6 h of ethanol exposure, and both growth arrest and enhanced <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> were reversed within 12 h of ethanol withdrawal.

However, direct measurements of EGF-R synthesis rates by [35 S]methionine incorporation revealed no differences between control and ethanol exposed cells. Internalization of EGF-R was significantly altered by ethanol exposure. A 2 -h incubation resulted in the internalization of 57 % of the ligand in control cells, while only 31 % of bound EGF was internalized in the ethanol exposed cells.

In both quiescent and EGF-stimulated cells, all-trans-retinoic acid inhibited ODC gene transcription and lowered ODC mRNA levels, whereas glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase expression remained unaffected. Treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid for 24 h resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease of up to 52 % in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> to EGF receptors and a 30 - 75 % decrease in EGF-receptor quantity. In addition, when cells were treated with both UV radiation and all-trans-retinoic acid, their effects were additive in causing a decrease in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding.</b> Blocking of EGF receptors with a neutralizing antibody for EGF receptors inhibited the induction of ODC activity by EGF.

40|$|AbstractProstaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) {{selectively}} {{decreases the}} binding of 125 I-labelled {{epidermal growth factor}} ([125 I]EGF) to intact Swiss 3 T 3 cells. Scatchard analysis reveals that PGF 2 α decreases the number of high-affinity <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> sites without changing {{the total number of}} receptors. Prostaglandins E 1 (PGE 1), E 2 (PGE 2 or F 2 β (PGF 2 β) do not alter the <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> to these cells and do not enhance the PGF 2 α effect. R- 59022 and R- 59949, two diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors, enhance the inhibitory effect of PGF 2 α, whereas down-modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) abolishes the effect. These results indicate that PGF 2 α, decreases <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> in Swiss 3 T 3 cells via PKC activation...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} receptors (EGF-R) have been {{measured}} in human {{tumors of the}} Central Nervous System (CNS) by 125 I <b>EGF</b> ligand <b>binding.</b> High affinity receptors (Ka congruent to 1 x 10 (9) M- 1) were detected in nearly all individual specimens of meningiomas and tumors of glial origin (astrocytomas, glioblastomas). The phosphotyrosine kinase activity associated with the EGF-R was evaluated by measuring the incorporation of gamma 32 P-ATP, after immunoprecipitation of the receptor with the monoclonal antibody EGFRI. A good relationship was observed between the EGF-binding capacity and the autophosphorylation of the receptor, indicating that in most cases functional molecules of EGF-R were expressed on the tumor membranes. In the group of meningiomas, no relationship could be established between the EGF-R level and the histopathology of the tumors. Astrocytomas exemplify a progression of malignancy, from benign (low grade astrocytomas) towards an increased malignant phenotype (glioblastomas). In this group, our observations indicate {{a positive relationship between}} the EGF-R level and phosphokinase activity and the degree of malignancy...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} ErbB receptor interplay {{induced by}} the epidermal growth factor (EGF) -related peptides in cell lines naturally expressing the four ErbB receptors. Down-regulation of cell surface ErbB- 1 or ErbB- 2 by intracellular expression of specific antibodies has allowed us to delineate the role of these receptors during signaling elicited by: <b>EGF</b> and heparin <b>binding</b> <b>EGF</b> (HB-EGF), ligands of ErbB- 1; betacellulin (BTC), a ligand of ErbB- 1 and ErbB- 4; and neu differentiation factor (NDF), a ligand of ErbB- 3 and ErbB- 4. Ligand-induced ErbB receptor heterodimerization follows a strict hierarchy and ErbB- 2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner of all ErbB proteins. NDF-activated ErbB- 3 or ErbB- 4 heterodimerize with ErbB- 1 only when no ErbB- 2 is available. If all ErbB receptors are present, NDF receptors preferentially dimerize with ErbB- 2. Furthermore, EGF- and BTC-induced activation of ErbB- 3 is impaired {{in the absence of}} ErbB- 2, suggesting that ErbB- 2 has a role in the lateral transmission of signals between other ErbB receptors. Finally, ErbB- 1 activated by all EGF-related peptides (EGF, HB-EGF, BTC and NDF) couples to SHC, whereas only ErbB- 1 activated by its own ligands associates with and phosphorylates Cbl. These results provide the first biochemical evidence that a given ErbB receptor has distinct signaling properties depending on its dimerization...|$|R
30|$|EGFR {{overexpression}} {{has been}} reported in many experimental cell lines and human carcinomas, such as head and neck cancer [17], esophageal cancer [18], gastric cancer [19], and primary cervical cancer [9 – 13]. As for uterine cervical cancer, a large amount of evidences demonstrate that elevated levels of EGFR are closely relevant to a more aggressive biological behavior and further to poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients clinically [20], making EGFR an attractive candidate for anti-cancer therapy. Immunofluorescence staining was adopted to further demonstrate high expression of EGFR on the membrane of HeLa cells. Recent reports of EGFR targeting strategies have involved use of anti-EGFR antibodies to block <b>EGF</b> by <b>binding</b> to the receptor or as a targeting ligand for the delivery of therapeutic agents [21]. However, the blocking effect of anti-EGFR antibodies was subtle if any in our study, and they were mainly used as a targeting ligand for the delivery of HGNs. EGFR-targeted therapy has recently been applied as a new therapeutic strategy in a variety of malignant tumors for its apparent correlation with radiotherapy [22].|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} among keratinocyte differentiation capacity, lipid synthesis, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism, plasma membrane composition, and {{epidermal growth factor}} (<b>EGF)</b> <b>binding</b> has been studied in SCC- 12 F 2 cells. The differentiation capacity of the cells, i. e., ionophore-induced cornified envelope formation, was inhibited by various retinoids and stimulated by hydrocortisone. Retinoids that caused a significant reduction of cornified envelope formation, i. e., retinoic acid and 13 -cis-retinoic acid, caused only minor changes in lipid synthesis and plasma membrane composition. Arotinoid ethylsulfone, having a minor effect on cornified envelope formation, caused a drastic inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, resulting in changes in the plasma membrane composition. Hydrocortisone stimulated cornified envelope formation but had only minor effects on lipid synthesis and plasma membrane composition. Of all retinoids tested, only arotinoid ethylsulfone caused a drastic increase in <b>EGF</b> <b>binding,</b> while hydrocortisone had no effect. Retinoic acid, arotinoid ethylsulfone, and hydrocortisone had no effects on LDL binding and only minor effects on LDL degradation. These results clearly demonstrate that the plasma membrane composition {{is not related to}} keratinocyte differentiation capacity, but most likely does determine <b>EGF</b> <b>binding.</b> Furthermore, <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> does not determine keratinocyte differentiation capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{content of}} epidermal-growth-factor {{receptor}} (EGFr) {{and its relation}} to TSH-response were examined in 27 malignant thyroid tumors (5 follicular, 6 papillary, 5 medullary, 11 anaplastic carcinomas) and in 30 tumor-like lesions (21 hyperplastic goiters and 9 toxic adenomatous goiters). Normal 12 thyroid tissues adjacent to benign tumors with no evidence of macroscopic or microscopic abnormalities were used as control. All thyroid plasma membranes tested showed specific <b>EGF</b> <b>binding.</b> In membranes from toxic adenomas (2. 18 +/- 0. 73 fmoles/mg protein) and papillary carcinomas (2. 80 +/- 0. 80) the <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> was similar to that of normal thyroid membranes (2. 32 +/- 0. 73). Hyperplastic goiters showed an <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> (4. 4 +/- 0. 82) slightly higher than normal tissue. The highest and the lowest <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> values were found in anaplastic (11. 8 +/- 2. 78) and medullary (0. 50 +/- 0. 39) carcinomas, respectively. An inverse correlation between EGFr content and TSH-response was found when anaplastic thyroid tumors were compared to tumor-like lesions. However no correlation was observed in medullary carcinomas which also failed to respond to TSH and in papillary carcinomas which partially respond to thyrotropin...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that isolated cytoskeletons of normal keratinocytes cultured under differentiation inducing conditions exhibit {{a high level}} of epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)</b> <b>binding.</b> This binding is approximately 300 % higher than the binding of intact cells. In contrast, various squamous carcinoma cell lines or normal keratinocytes cultured under differentiation retarding conditions exhibit <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> to isolated cytoskeletons which is around 10 – 20 % of the binding to intact cells. Incubation of normal keratinocytes in the presence of arotinoid ethyl sulfone resulted in a marked decrease of the ability of the cells to differentiate, and a decrease of <b>EGF</b> <b>binding</b> to isolated cytoskeletons. These results suggest a close relationship between the differentiation capacity of the cells and the presence of cytoskeleton-associated EGF receptors. Similar results were obtained for low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding...|$|E
40|$|Previous work {{showed that}} cultured human {{pancreatic}} cancer cells overexpress the {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) receptor. In the present study, we sought to determine whether some of these cell lines produce {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGF-alpha). Utilizing a radiolabeled TGF-alpha cDNA in hybridization experiments, we determined that ASPC- 1, T 3 M 4, PANC- 1, COLO- 357, and MIA PaCa- 2 cell lines expressed TGF-alpha mRNA. Serum-free medium conditioned by T 3 M 4 and ASPC- 1 cells contained significant amounts of TGF-alpha protein. Although unlabeled TGF-alpha readily competed with 125 I-labeled <b>EGF</b> for <b>binding,</b> each cell line exhibited lower surface binding and internalization of 125 I-labeled TGF-alpha as compared to 125 I-labeled EGF. Both TGF-alpha and EGF significantly enhanced the anchorage-independent growth of PANC- 1, T 3 M 4, and ASPC- 1 cells. However, TGF-alpha was 10 - to 100 -fold more potent than EGF. These findings suggest that the concomitant overexpression of EGF receptors and production of TGF-alpha may represent an efficient mechanism for certain cancer cells to obtain a growth advantage...|$|R
40|$|We have {{produced}} two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 528 IgG 2 a and 225 IgG 1, which bind {{to the human}} EGF receptor with an affinity comparable to EGF, compete with <b>EGF</b> for <b>binding</b> to the receptor, and prevent EGF-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinase. The mAbs inhibit the proliferation {{of a number of}} human tumor cells bearing high numbers of EGF receptors in culture and in nude mouse xenographs. A 431 xenographs bearing high numbers of EGF receptors can be imaged with 111 In-labeled mAb. Phase I trials were initiated in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which consistently expresses high numbers of EGF receptors. 111 In-labeled 225 IgG 1 was given by single intravenous infusion. Preliminary results show no toxicity from doses up to 120 mg. Tumor visualization was seen to be dose-related. However, as with other imaging studies with indium-labeled antibodies, significant liver and bowel isotope uptake was observed. Further dose escalation is ongoing to assess the relationship between dose and tumor uptake...|$|R
40|$|Regenerative {{proliferation}} {{occurs in}} the inner-ear sensory epithelial of warm-blooded vertebrates after insult. To determine how this proliferation is controlled in the mature mammalian inner ear, several growth factors were tested for effects on progenitor-cell division in cultured mouse vestibular sensory epithelia. Cell proliferation was induced in the sensory epithelium by {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGF-alpha) in a dose-dependent manner. Proliferation was also induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) when supplemented with insulin, but not EGF alone. These observations suggest that stimulation of the EGF receptors by TGF-alpha <b>binding,</b> or <b>EGF</b> (plus insulin) <b>binding,</b> stimulates cell proliferation in the mature mammalian vestibular sensory epithelium...|$|R
