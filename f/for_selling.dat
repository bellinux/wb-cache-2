We offer two explanations for this prediction: (1) the unconscious tendency to process information in a manner that supports one’s goal, which we refer to as the “objectivity illusion ” hypothesis, and (2) the economic in-centive to boost trade, which we refer to as the “trade boosting ” hypothesis. The pattern of analyst forecast bias we predict (i. e., optimism for buys and pes-simism <b>for</b> <b>sells)</b> is opposite in direction to that predicted by the management relations hypothesis—a commonly cited hypothesis for analyst forecast bias. We find broker-analyst earnings forecast errors are significantly op-timistic for buy recommendations and significantly pessimistic <b>for</b> <b>sell</b> ∗ Santa Clara University; †Brigham Young University and PricewaterhouseCoopers; ‡ University of Washington.
