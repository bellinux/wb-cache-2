Schwedler himself would have preferred it to be used less on aesthetic grounds. His first use of the innovation was for the railway bridge over the Weser at Corvey, {{on the edge of}} Höxter (1864), for which he won a gold medal at the 1867 Paris International Exposition. One of the last remaining examples is the bridge carrying the Nagold Valley Railway over the Nagold in Unterreichenbach.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal is}} said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is {{approximately}} that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It {{is said to}} have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; some say it is a horn. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet {{is said to be}} entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown to me, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and applelike fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.|$|E

[...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self.

500|$|James M. Redfield, a {{classics}} {{professor at}} the University of Chicago, in his article [...] "An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet" [...] finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's Poetics, with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes {{the outcome of the}} plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet [...] "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is [...] "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ("This is the mouse..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing [...] "us that teasing is a kind of loving when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, teaches us what it is to live in the real world." ...|$|E
