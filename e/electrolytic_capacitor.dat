25|$|Comparing the {{capacitors}} {{from the}} table with a supercapacitor, the highest energy density capacitor family. For this, the capacitor 25nbsp& F/2.3nbsp&V in dimensions D × H = 16nbsp&mm × 26nbsp&mm from Maxwell HC Series, compared with the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> of approximately equal size in the table. This supercapacitor has roughly 5000 times higher capacitance than the 4700/10 <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> but ¼ of the voltage and has about 66,000nbsp&mWs (0.018nbsp&Wh) stored electrical energy, approximately 100 times higher energy density (40 to 280 times) than the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The modern <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor,</b> an {{essential}} component of most rectifier circuit configurations was also developed from the electrolytic rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{thickness}} of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage, the dielectric thickness can be tailored to the rated voltage of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10V <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> has a dielectric thickness of only about 0.014µm, a 100V <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> of only about 0.14µm. Thus, the dielectric strength also influences the size of the capacitor. However, due to standardized safety margins the actual forming voltage of electrolytic capacitors is higher than the rated voltage of the component.|$|E
40|$|Because of on an SBIR {{contract}} with NASA, Cornell-Dubilier {{has been able}} to commercialize <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> based on the design of hermetically sealed <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> used by the Marshall Space Flight Center. The NASA contract was for the development of hermetic aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> and through which Cornell-Dubilier's Type MLP and Type MLS Flatback Aluminum <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Capacitors</b> have emerged. As opposed to gassing <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> the development of nongassing electrolytes makes it possible to manufacture hermetic aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> free of "wearout" from electrolytic loss. Tests of the hermetic capacitors designed for NASA demonstrated expected life-spans of more than 20 years...|$|R
50|$|Niobium <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> are passive {{electronic}} components {{and members of}} the family of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{form the}} bulk of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> used in {{electronics}} because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium <b>electrolytic</b> chip <b>capacitors</b> are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> chip <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} {{with solid}} electrolyte cannot withstand transients or peak voltages {{higher than the}} surge voltage. Transients {{for this type of}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> may destroy the component.|$|E
25|$|Radial or {{single-ended}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> styles have a bar {{across the}} side of the capacitor to indicate the negative terminal side, and the negative terminal lead is shorter than the positive terminal lead.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> in {{principle}} forms a plate capacitor whose capacitance is greater {{the larger the}} electrode area, A, and the permittivity, ε, are and the thinner the thickness, d, of the dielectric is.|$|E
25|$|Applying a lower voltage {{may have}} a {{positive}} influence on <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors.</b> For aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> a lower applied voltage can in some cases extend the lifetime. For tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.|$|R
50|$|The life time, service life, load life or {{useful life}} of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is a special}} {{characteristic}} of non-solid <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> especially non-solid aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> which liquid electrolyte can evaporate over the time leading to wear-out failures. Solid niobium capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so the constant failure rate lasts {{up to the point}} all capacitors have failed. They don’t have a life time specification like non-solid aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Niobium <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> are {{in direct}} {{competition}} with industrial tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> because niobium is more readily available. Their properties are comparable.|$|R
25|$|The {{thickness}} of the spacer depends on the rated voltage of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor.</b> It is up to 100V between 30 and 75µm. For higher voltages, several layers of paper (duplex paper) are used to increase the breakdown strength.|$|E
25|$|Dielectric {{absorption}} may be {{a problem}} in circuits where very small currents are used in the function of an electronic circuit, such as long-time-constant integrators or sample-and-hold circuits. In most <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> applications supporting power supply lines, dielectric absorption is not a problem.|$|E
25|$|In {{schematic}} diagrams, {{a capacitor}} used primarily for DC charge storage is often drawn vertically in circuit diagrams with the lower, more negative, plate drawn as an arc. The straight plate indicates the positive terminal of the device, {{if it is}} polarized (see <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor).</b>|$|E
50|$|Like other <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> niobium <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> are {{polarized}} {{and require}} the anode electrode voltage {{to be positive}} relative to the cathode voltage.|$|R
25|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{depend on the}} structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> which depends on measuring frequency and temperature. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> with non-solid electrolytes show a broader aberration over frequency and temperature ranges than do capacitors with solid electrolytes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{with solid}} {{electrolyte}} {{do not have}} wear-out failures so {{they do not have}} a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} {{group is the}} fixed capacitors. Many got their names from the dielectric. For a systematic classification these characteristics can't be used, {{because one of the}} oldest, the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor,</b> is named instead by its cathode construction. So the most-used names are simply historical.|$|E
25|$|Axial <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> styles have a bar across {{or around}} the case {{pointing}} to the negative lead end to indicate the negative terminal. The positive terminal of the capacitor {{is on the side}} of the sealing. The negative terminal lead is shorter than the positive terminal lead.|$|E
25|$|In {{case of a}} malfunction, {{overload}} {{or wrong}} polarity operating inside the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> housing, substantial gas pressure can arise. The tubs are designed to open a pressure relief vent and release high pressure gas, including parts of the electrolyte. This vent protects against bursting, explosion or fly away of the metal tub.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{in the early}} 1950s with manganese dioxide as solid electrolyte, which has a 10 times better conductivity than all other types of non-solid electrolytes, also influenced the {{development of}} aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors.</b> In 1964 the first aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> with solid electrolyte (Solid aluminum capacitor (SAL)) appeared on the market, developed by Philips.|$|R
25|$|The {{encapsulation}} {{of aluminum}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> is also made of aluminum {{in order to}} avoid galvanic reactions, normally with an aluminum case (can, tub). For radial <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> it is connected across the electrolyte with a non-defined resistance to the cathode (ground). For axial <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> however, the housing is specifically designed with a direct contact to the cathode.|$|R
2500|$|William Dubilier, {{whose first}} patent for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> was filed in 1928, industrialized the new ideas for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> and started {{large-scale}} commercial production in 1931 in the Cornell-Dubilier (CD) factory in Plainfield, New Jersey. At {{the same time}} in Berlin, Germany, the [...] "Hydra-Werke", an AEG company, started the production of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> in large quantities.|$|R
25|$|The first solid {{electrolyte}} of manganese dioxide developed 1952 for tantalum capacitors had a conductivity 10 {{times better than}} all other types of non-{{solid electrolyte}}s. It also influenced the development of aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In 1964 the first aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte SAL <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> came on the market, developed by Philips.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacitance}} {{value of}} an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> depends on the measuring frequency and temperature. The value at a measuring frequency of 1kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120Hz value. Therefore, the capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors are not directly comparable and {{differ from those of}} film capacitors or ceramic capacitors, whose capacitance is measured at 1kHz or higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{is defined by}} the product of {{capacitance}} and voltage, the so-called CV-volume. However, in comparing the permittivities of different oxide materials, it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has an approximately 3 times higher permittivity than aluminum oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value can therefore be smaller than aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E

25|$|Ceramic {{and film}} {{capacitors}} are {{already out of}} their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100nbsp&MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{is connected in parallel}} with a ceramic or film capacitor.|$|E
25|$|This rule is {{also known}} as Arrhenius rule. It characterizes the change of thermic {{reaction}} speed. For every 10°C lower temperature the evaporation is reduced by half. That means for every 10°C lower temperature the lifetime of capacitors doubles. If a lifetime specification of an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> is, for example, 2000 h/105°C, the capacitor's lifetime at 45°C can be ”calculated” as 128,000 hours—that is roughly 15 years—by using the 10-degrees-rule.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized capacitors {{because of their}} anodization principle. They can only be operated with DC voltage applied with the correct polarity. Operating the capacitor with wrong polarity or with AC voltage leads to a short circuit and can destroy the component. The exceptions is the bipolar aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor,</b> which has a back-to-back configuration of two anodes in one case {{and can be used}} in AC applications.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors {{compete with}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> and {{rechargeable}} batteries especially lithium-ion batteries. The following table compares the major {{parameters of the}} three main supercapacitor families with <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> and batteries.|$|R
50|$|The {{dielectric}} {{thickness of}} niobium <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> is very thin, {{in the range}} of nano-meter per volt. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer, combined with a sufficiently high dielectric strength, the niobium <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> can achieve a high volumetric capacitance comparable to tantalum capacitors. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> compared with other conventional capacitors.|$|R
25|$|Standard <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors,</b> and {{aluminum}} {{as well as}} tantalum and niobium <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> are polarized and generally require the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.|$|R
