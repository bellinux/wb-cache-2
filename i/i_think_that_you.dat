5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (<b>that)</b> <b>you</b> are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
500|$|Although Mitchell's defense {{attorney}} argued that Jones' injuries were inconsistent with {{those found in}} Manson's paintings, Lord Nimmo Smith said during sentencing that he did [...] "not feel able {{to ignore the fact}} that there was a degree of resemblance between the injuries inflicted on Jodi and those shown in the Marilyn Manson paintings of Elizabeth Short that we saw. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> carried an image of the paintings in your memory when you killed Jodi." [...] Mitchell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to serve a minimum of twenty years in prison. Manson later dismissed claims that his work inspired the murder, arguing instead that [...] "the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive" [...] plays a more direct role in violent behavior, and criticised media who attempted to [...] " [...] the blame elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E

"Well, well! <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> was {{a gentleman}} that would not go back from your word. <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would never put a young lady to the {{necessity}} of bringing forward her own letters to prove {{that she is not}} expecting more than she has a right! You don't know! And that, after all that has been between us! John Eames!" [...] And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly.|$|R

500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's {{one of the reasons we}} look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Baroness," [...] he said, [...] "my {{advice to}} you, {{for your own}} good entirely, is, with all respect to your husband, that you shorten your honeymoon and pay your respects to the Emperor. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe it to him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe it to your country." ...|$|E
