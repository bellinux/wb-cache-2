Energy efficiency is also {{regarded as one of the}} greater cost-benefit potential alternatives to achieve GHG reduction. Moreover, the transport sector in Mexico represents 44.7% of the total final consumption of energy, almost 17% more than the world average (28%). Thus, replacing low fuel efficient transport with alternative fuels is regarded as a considerable contribution to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions by the year 2050, as established by the General Law on Climate Change commitments. Therefore, incentives for PHEVs have been created both at regional and federal levels to decrease cost of ownership for the end-consumers.|$|E

Livestock account for 80 % of the total <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> in Uruguay, and beef cow-calf systems are possibly the largest contributors.

The total on-site <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> were estimated to be 0. 0056 kg/m(3) and 0. 6765 kg/m(3) respectively, while total off-site <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> were estimated to be 0. 3699 kg/m(3) and 0. 4816 kg/m(3).

Emissions from both processes were lower than that from the tap water production. Wastewater reclamation and reuse should be promoted as it not only saves the water resources but also can reduce the <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions.</b> Energy consumption was the most significant source of <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions.</b> Biogas recovery should be employed as it can significantly reduce the <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions,</b> especially under the type 2 treatment process.

The University of Wageningen analysis found that the CO2 production per kilogram of mass gain for the five insect species studied was 39-129% that of pigs and 12-54% that of cattle.

There is growing interesting in reducing <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> in freight transportation. Fifty-nine strategies are identified as potential best practices for these reductions. Total estimated <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions by 2025 for all practices is 4. 6 × 108 tons CO 2 eq., which is 42 % of 2025 <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> if no best practice is implemented. For the truck mode, 2025 <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> could be reduced by 28 percent compared to 2003 levels. Of other four modes, 2025 <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> could increase by 20, 8, 22, and 9 percent, respectively, compared to 2003 levels, which is smaller than the increase if no best practices are implemented. For thirteen practices for which costs were assessed quantitatively, ten practices may produce net cost savings concurrent with substantial reductions in <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions.</b> Based on current prices, switching from petroleum to biodiesel can reduce <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> but increase total costs. Inter-modal shifts could lead to potentially larger reductions. For example, a shift from truck to rail modes can reduce <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> per ton-mile by 85 percent, even when truck transport at the start {{and end of the}} trip are considered. The results of the assessments are the basis for development of a guidebook that identifies and characterizes these best practices...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} be {{prepared}} for future environmental regulations and to improve market competitiveness, companies are realizing that they have to reduce greenhouse gas (<b>GHG)</b> <b>emissions</b> from a supply chain perspective.

Although there is so far no policy targeted on supply chain <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction, researchers have recognized that companies in pursuit of green supply chain strategies could leverage the opportunities offered by market-based instruments such as emission trading.
