Sustainability requirement of Gen. IV reactors recommends exploring alternate power cycle configurations capable of reaching high thermal efficiency. By adopting the anticipated working parameters of next SFRs, this paper investigates the potential of some Rankine and He-Brayton layouts to reach thermal efficiencies as high as feasible, {{so that they could}} become alternates for SFR reactor balance of plant. The assessment has <b>encompassed</b> <b>from</b> subcritical to super-critical Rankine cycles and combined cycles based on He-Brayton gas cycles of different complexity coupled to Organic Rankine Cycles. The sub-critical Rankine configuration reached at thermal efficiency higher than 43 %, which {{has been shown to be}} a superior performance than any of the He- Brayton configurations analyzed. By adopting a super-critical Rankine arrangement, thermal efficiency would increase less than 1. 5 %. In short, according to the present study a sub-critical layout seems to be the most promising configuration for all those upcoming prototypes to be operated in the short term (10 15 years). The potential of super-critical CO 2 -Brayton cycles should be explored for future SFRs to be deployed in a longer run. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Invader traits (including {{plant growth}} form) may play an important, and perhaps overlooked, role in {{determining}} macroscale patterns of biological invasions and therefore warrant greater consideration in future investigations aimed at understanding these patterns. To assess this need, we used empirical data from a national-level survey of forest in the contiguous 48 states of the USA to identify geographic hotspots of forest plant invasion for three distinct invasion characteristics: invasive species richness, trait richness (defined {{as the number of}} the five following plant growth forms represented by the invasive plants present at a given location: forbs, grasses, shrubs, trees, and vines), and species richness within each growth form. Three key findings emerged. 1) Th e hotspots identified <b>encompassed</b> <b>from</b> 9 to 23 % of the total area of our study region, thereby revealing many forests to be not only invaded, but highly invaded. 2) Substantial spatial disagreement among hotspots of invasive species richness, invasive trait richness, and species richness of invasive plants within each growth form revealed many locations to be hotspots for invader traits, or for particular growth forms of invasive plants, rather than for invasive plants in general. 3) Despite eastern forests exhibiting higher levels of plant invasion than western forests, species richness for invasive forbs and grasses in the west were respectively greater than and equivalent to levels found in the east. Contrasting patterns between eastern and western forests in the number of invasive species detected for each growth form combined with the spatial disagreement found among hotspot types suggests trait-based variability in invasion drivers. Our findings reveal invader traits to be an important contributor to macroscale invasion patterns...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMultimodality {{has become}} one of today's most crucial {{challenges}} both for linguistics and computer science, entailing theoretical issues as well as practical ones (verbal interaction description, human-machine dialogues, virtual reality etc [...] .). Understanding interaction processes {{is one of the main}} targets of these sciences, and requires to take into account the whole set of modalities and the way they interact. From a linguistic standpoint, language and speech analysis are based on studies of distinct research fields, such as phonetics, phonemics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics or gesture studies. Each of them have been investigated in the past either separately or in relation with another field that was considered as closely connected (e. g. syntax and semantics, prosody and syntax, etc.). The perspective adopted by modern linguistics is a considerably broader one: even though each domain reveals a certain degree of autonomy, it cannot be accounted for independently from its interactions with the other domains. Accordingly, the study of the interaction between the fields appears to be as important as the study of each distinct field. This is a pre-requisite for an elaboration of a valid theory of language. However, as important as the needs in this area might be, high level multimodal resources and adequate methods in order to construct them are scarce and unequally developed. Ongoing projects mainly focus on one modality as a main target, with an alternate modality as an optional complement. Moreover, coding standards in this field remain very partial and do not cover all the needs in terms of multimodal annotation. One of the first issues we have to face is the definition of a coding scheme providing adequate responses to the needs of the various levels <b>encompassed,</b> <b>from</b> phonetics to pragmatics or syntax. While working in the general context of international coding standards, we plan to create a specific coding standard designed to supply proper responses to the specific needs of multimodal annotation, as available solutions in the area do not seem to be totally satisfactory. <BR /...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{scholars}} such as John Monfasani have proved that the most famous treatise of Cardinal Bessarion (1408 - 1472), i. e. the In calumniatorem Platonis, was not totally written and reviewed by the Cardinal himself, but {{was the result of}} the collaboration between the members of his cultural circle: for example, the first draft of the Greek version was revised by Theodore Gaza; the Latin text was first corrected by Giovan Andrea Bussi and then by Niccolò Perotti; the third book of the final version was largely copied from a treatise written by Giovanni Gatti. Now, we can say the same about a work that was written by Perotti soon after the publication of the ICP, the Refutatio deliramentorum Georgii Trapezuntii Cretensis. In fact, at the end of 1469, Domizio Calderini wrote a long letter to the bishop of Treviso Francesco Barozzi, in which he confutes an essay composed by George of Trebizond against the ICP, the so-called Annotationes. The refutation of the Annotationes written by Calderini was copied and augmented by Perotti and became the first part of his Refutatio, which, at its first redactional stage, still appears as an anonymous work; but, when Perotti decided to give to Bessarion a copy of the Refutatio, he resolved to ascribe to himself the whole essay. During my researches, I was also able to find in the Refutatio some contributions of another member of Bessarion’s circle, the theologian Giorgio Benigno Salviati, who was the first to write a treatise, now lost, against George of Trebizond’s Annotationes. In my paper, I will discuss the problem of authorship concerning the Refutatio and the different redactional stages the Refutatio <b>encompassed</b> <b>from</b> Calderini’s Epistola onwards, and I will show why the Refutatio cannot be considered the product of a single person, but of the whole Bessarion’s familia, and how blurred the concepts of author and authorship were inside the Academia Bessarionis. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is development of a coupled orthogonal curvilinear/Cartesian grid solver. The solver requires a thin orthogonal boundary layer grid and a non-uniform Cartesian grid to resolve the boundary layer on a solid surface and the flow region away from the surface, respectively. Flows inside the orthogonal boundary layer and Cartesian background grids are solved by different CFD solvers which are coupled by an overset grid method. SUGGAR code writes the grid domain connectivity information into a file that identifies grid points necessary for the overset grid interpolation. In order to satisfy mass conservation across the overlapping region, the pressure Poisson equations and the overset interpolation equations are <b>encompassed</b> <b>from</b> both of the solvers and solved simultaneously by an iterative method. Accuracy of the coupled orthogonal curvilinear/Cartesian grid solver was evaluated in terms of flows past circular cylinders because the orthogonal boundary layer grids can be generated easily due to its simple cylindrical shape. In this study, additional numerical simulations were also performed by the original orthogonal curvilinear and Cartesian grid solvers in order to obtain the benchmark data to compare with the results of the coupled orthogonal curvilinear/Cartesian grid solver. The coupled orthogonal curvilinear/Cartesian grid solver was applied to steady and unsteady laminar flows at Re = 40 and 200, single-phase turbulent flows at subcritical Re = 3900 and supercritical Re = 5 × 105 and 1 × 106, and two-phase flows at (Re, Fr) = (2. 7 × 104, 0. 20), (2. 7 × 104, 0. 80), and (4. 58 × 105, 1. 64). Those numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental and numerical results in the literature. Effects of the grid resolution on the numerical results were analyzed in this study. The analysis showed the more accurate resolution of near-wall regions by the boundary layer grids for the coupled orthogonal curvilinear/Cartesian grid solver. It also presented the similar trends of the flow at the subcritical Re with the vertical resolution to those observed in the literature. The coupled orthogonal curvilinear/Cartesian grid solver predicted much delayed separations of the boundary layers at both the supercritical Re, which caused the narrower wakes and the shorter recirculation regions than those at the subcritical Re. The features of surface pressure corresponded to the postponed separations. The solver developed in this study showed the similar trends in the two-phase flows at Fr = 0. 20 and 0. 80 to those observed by the past numerical studies. The trends of the vortex shedding, deviating shear layers, and the expanded wake on the free surface are more prominent in the flow at Fr = 0. 80 than that at Fr = 0. 20. At Re = 4. 58 × 105 and Fr = 1. 64, the flow near the free surface includes the small recirculation region behind the cylinder, which corresponds to the cavity structure on the free surface in the same region, and two large symmetric recirculation regions. The shear layers separating from the cylinder surface move along the outer edges of the recirculation regions. Another pair of the shear layers is separated from the smaller recirculation region...|$|E

Further appealing feature for THz ray is the nonionizing nature and the distinctive optical response of various materials are important for analyzing diverse applications such as material quality control, pharmaceutical, industrial production lines, and biological. Upon that THz waves have been utilized for imaging and spectroscopy, especially Terahertz Time-­‐Domain Spectroscopy (THz-­‐TDS) associated to its ability in measuring the change in the electric field with high sensitivity in time-­‐domain. Surface plasmon-­‐polaritons (SPPs) at metal-­‐dielectric interfaces have been proven for several decades as a reliable technique for surface analysis and investigation of thin films due to the two dimensional nature of SPPs and the strong electromagnetic field at the interface. Extraordinary transmission of light through subwavelength hole arrays has attracted many areas of applications including optical data storage, near field microscopy, optical displays, and thin film sensing. The enhancement in the tunneled transmission light stemming from the coupling with SPP by the surface configurations has been explored through the waveguide theory and the grating theory of the frequency-­‐selective characteristic of SPP resonances. At THz frequencies, the extraordinary transmission through thin metallic hole arrays has been demonstrated through the excitation of SPP on the metal–dielectric interface confining the incident THz pulse around the holes, hence precluding THz pulse from easily passing and attenuating into the conductor. Implementing THz SPP in thin film sensing has great potential for industrial applications because the two dimensional nature of SPPs and the strong electromagnetic field at the interfacewith the THz natural reaction with the material provides reliable measurements of thin film spectroscopy including optical and dielectric constants, film thickness, and inhomogeneities at interfaces with high precision. This motivates the investigation of the characteristics such as purity of thin organic film including PMMA and those used in organic light emitting diode (OLED) through THz SPR devices. Two SPR devices contain either 2 D periodic circular or square hole array in 500 nm Al on an 5 mm-­‐thick intrinsic silicon, or a single subwavelength aperture surrounded by concentric periodic grooves of a set period in a metal plate (which is known as a Bull’s eye structure), and was fabricated by following the micro-­‐ fabrications process <b>encompassed</b> <b>from</b> UV photolithography and wet and dry etching to transfer the pattern into the Al film. The SPR device consisting of 2 D periodic circular or square hole array with and without thin Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film on it is placed at the focus of the THz beam in transmission THz-­‐TDS, where the spectrum is obtained from the Fourier-­‐ transformed sample and reference THz pulses. The transmission is obtained from the ratio between the sample spectrum and reference spectrum, whereas the phase change is the phase difference between the two spectra. To avoid overlap with water absorption lines, the optimal SPR device design has a period of 320 μm and square holes of 150 μm side length. We successfully confirmed the theoretical SPR frequencies for metal-­‐silicon mode and demonstrate a shift to 0. 9211 THz due to 2 μm of PMMA layer on the surface...|$|E
