40|$|Modern {{software}} {{systems have}} to be prepared not just for anticipated but for unanticipated evolution as well. A perfectly prepared system exhibits a structure that reflects the anticipated subjects of change and flexibly bridges collaboration mismatch resulting from unanticipated changes. In this paper, we discuss how this can be accomplished. First, we give an overview of several approaches to the evolution of object systems and discuss their potential to make a system better prepared for anticipated evolution. Then, we place our emphasis on unanticipated evolution where we find the flexibility of object coupling to be a crucial system property. We present the major concerns of object coupling and a set of <b>flexible,</b> design-oriented object <b>coupling</b> mechanisms. Each one of these mechanisms exhibits considerable flexibility regarding {{at least one of the}} concerns of object <b>coupling.</b> <b>Flexible</b> object <b>coupling</b> mechanisms raise the issue of run-time failures. Thus, these mechanisms should not be used extensively throughout the entire system, but only where they can be most effective. We introduce Design for Slippage, a small conceptual framework providing decision support for the application of <b>flexible</b> object <b>coupling</b> mechanisms. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} high prices for fossil raw {{materials}} {{the production of}} biomass-based products is rarely economically successful today. Depending on the location feedstock prices are currently so high that products from renewable resources are not marketable when produced in existing process chains.

40|$|Quantum dots (QDs) {{are widely}} used in the immune detection. Yet, the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of the immune detection are not satisfactory because the binding sites of QDs onto antibody (Ab) are often arbitrary {{and the influence of}} the large surface electronic potential energy of QDs on the directly conjugated Ab is nonnegligible.

Successful coupling of the HBsAb to our highly luminescent CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs is proven with Gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
