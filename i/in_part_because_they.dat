Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato {{decided to make}} the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E

When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> enjoyed watching soccer together.

He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and once order was restored among the soldiers, the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' {{dominance}} in the late 1970s was {{due in part to}} the presence of the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) (which had begun play in 1972) — the Canadiens were far more successful compared to other NHL teams in resisting WHA efforts to lure away top talent. The Canadiens played a central role in the 1979 merger with the WHA, which added the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets to the NHL. After years of talks, a merger agreement was reached between the two leagues, but the NHL's governors rejected the deal by one vote. Most of the NHL's American teams were in favour of the merger <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought it would help them challenge Montreal's dominance, whereas against the deal were the Canadiens, who, along with the Vancouver Canucks and Toronto Maple Leafs, opposed splitting Hockey Night in Canada television revenues six ways instead of three. Upon hearing the result of the vote, fans in Edmonton, Quebec and Winnipeg launched a massive boycott of products sold by Molson, owners of the Canadiens since 1978. The boycott, along with pressure from the Canadian House of Commons, led Montreal and Vancouver to reverse their positions when a re-vote was held on March 22, 1979, allowing the merger to pass.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{experienced}} {{a number of}} changes during the time period megalodon existed which affected marine life. A cooling trend starting in the Oligocene 35 mya ultimately led to glaciation at the poles. Geological events changed currents and precipitation; among these were {{the closure of the}} Circumtropical Seaway between the Americas and through the Tethys Sea, contributing to the cooling of the oceans. The stalling of the Gulf Stream prevented nutrient-rich water from reaching major marine ecosystems, which may have negatively affected its food sources. As its range did not apparently extend into colder waters, megalodon may {{not have been able to}} retain a significant amount of metabolic heat, so its range was restricted to shrinking tropical waters. Fossil evidence confirms the absence of megalodon in regions around the world where water temperatures had significantly declined during the Pliocene. The largest fluctuation of sea levels in the Cenozoic era occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, between around 5 mya to 12 thousand years ago (kya), due to the expansion of glaciers at the pole, which negatively impacted coastal environments, and may have contributed to its extinction along with those of several other marine megafaunal species. These oceanographic changes, in particular the sea level drops, may have restricted many of the suitable shallow warm-water nursery sites for megalodon, hindering reproduction. Nursery areas are pivotal for the survival of many shark species, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> protect juveniles from predation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{practice}} of informal polygamy among fundamentalist groups presents interesting legal issues.

They exemplified the debate which would follow, with one proposing a route along the coast through the larger coastal towns, while the other proposed an inner route via Askim and Rakkestad. Preliminary surveys were carried out the following year, which also investigated two routes to the Swedish border, one via Tistedalen and one along Iddefjord. The government was at first less enthusiastic, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were concerned that no line would be built on the Swedish side.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable {{by changes in}} the number and identity of the halogen atoms. In general they are volatile, but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the halides, which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at −161°C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between −51.7 (CF2H2) and −128°C (CF4). The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. The CFCs are far less flammable than methane, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because, {{in the case of}} the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames.|$|E

25|$|Health {{care for}} {{homeless}} {{people is a}} major public health challenge.

There are significant challenges in treating homeless people who have psychiatric disorders because clinical appointments may not be kept, their continuing whereabouts are unknown, their medicines may not be taken as prescribed and monitored, medical and psychiatric histories are not accurate, and for other reasons.
