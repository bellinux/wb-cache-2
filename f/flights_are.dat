25|$|More than 280 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{cancelled}} at Heathrow airport, over 120 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled at Doncaster Sheffield Airport and 80 more <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled due {{to health}} and safety reasons at Manchester Airport. Many <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed at Ireland's airports {{on the morning of}} 19 January due to the high winds in Ireland, however by afternoon they were delayed because of high winds elsewhere in Europe.|$|R
25|$|All {{flights in}} and out of Heathrow were halted for a short time after the accident. When {{operations}} resumed, many long-haul outbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> either delayed or cancelled, and all short-haul <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled {{for the rest of the}} day. Some inbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed, and 24 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> diverted to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. In an attempt to minimise further travel disruptions, Heathrow Airport received dispensation from the Department for Transport to operate some night flights. Even so, the following day (18 January) a total of 113 short-haul <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled due to crews and aircraft being out of position.|$|R
50|$|When {{the fourth}} <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> first {{announced}} in August 2008, {{shortly after the}} third <b>flight</b> failed, it <b>was</b> planned for launch in September. The rocket {{that was used to}} conduct the test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> originally built to launch the RazakSAT satellite. The test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the launch schedule because Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd (ATSB) required a successful <b>flight</b> to <b>be</b> conducted before RazakSAT could be launched.|$|R
5|$|Today, Eilat Airport sustains {{peak loads}} {{concentrated}} into Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. On Thursdays and Sundays, <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> handled {{in a period}} of a few hours in the mornings and on Saturdays only the evening hours are used. Often there are days when 10,000 passengers on 120 <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> channelled through the 2,800m2 terminal, counting as one of the highest peak loads worldwide in this category.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E
5|$|Airlines {{operating}} under Air Canada Express, Air New Zealand Link, Cimber A/S, Lufthansa Regional and United Express {{are not necessarily}} members of Star Alliance. However, <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> operated {{on behalf of the}} respective member airlines, carry their designator code and are Star Alliance flights.|$|E
40|$|Wind velocity, light intensity, soil temperature, vapor {{pressure}} {{deficit in the}} colony, {{vapor pressure}} deficit at {{the surface of the}} flight slits, and vapor pressure deficit at 1 m above the soil were measured during the swarming season. The vapor pressure deficits and soil temperature were not critical factors for <b>flight</b> since they <b>were</b> in a favorable range during the observation period. Light intensity had to drop to 10. 8 lumen/m 2 before <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> initiated. <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> terminated when the light was reduced to 0. 14 lumen/m 2. Light intensity, however, was not limiting since the intensity dropped every evening. The key microenvironmental factor regulating <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> the wind velocity at the <b>flight</b> slits. <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> initiated if the wind velocity was below 3. 7 km/h. If the wind increased to over 3. 7 km/h after <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> started, <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> terminated...|$|R
40|$|The first <b>flight</b> (47) <b>was</b> for Will's {{baseline}} controller validation with Thor using varying doublet {{patterns in}} the pitch and roll axes.

5|$|Buildings, {{operations}} and management {{have become increasingly}} sophisticated since the mid 20th century, when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights. Detailed technical standards {{have been developed to}} ensure safety and common coding systems implemented to provide global consistency. The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> among the most complex and interconnected in the world. By the second decade of the 21st century, there were over 1,200 international airports and almost two billion international passengers along with 50 million metric tonnes of cargo were passing through them annually.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{made under}} aero tow in October 1941. More <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> made the {{following}} year but then development stopped, as war work took priority.|$|R

5|$|In 1955 the British {{government}} decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in Benbecula, where test firings and <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again. A variety of military buildings and masts {{have since been}} erected, including a canteen (which is not open to the public), the Puff Inn. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.|$|E

50|$|The Governor-General's <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> a Royal Australian Air Force {{transport}} unit. The Governor-General's <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> {{formed at}} RAAF Station Canberra on 4 April 1945. The unit {{was equipped with}} an Avro York named 'Endeavour', an Avro Anson and a Percival Proctor. Although the Flight initially only provided transport for the Governor-General of Australia its role was later expanded to include carrying the Prime Minister and other dignitaries. The Governor-General's <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> disbanded on 10 July 1947 and No. 1 Communication Unit assumed responsibility for VIP transport. The <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> re-raised on 1 July 1948 equipped with a B-24 Liberator and a Dakota. The <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> disbanded {{for a second and}} final time on 1 October 1950 with the VIP transport role being transferred to No. 36 Squadron.|$|R

5|$|Widerøe {{operates}} all {{scheduled services}} out of Førde, connecting it to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland {{with a combined}} seven daily flights. The <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> operated with Dash 8-100 aircraft and are subsidized {{as part of a}} public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Førde Airport is the local airport for ten municipalities in Sunnfjord and outer Sogn. The airport had 82,356 passengers, 8,109 aircraft movements and 3 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Less than a fifth of the patronage travels to Bergen, and Førde even experiences some leakage by people driving to Bergen Airport directly.|$|E
5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, can {{be taken}} by sending {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated {{a new way to}} probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief {{activity}} period, leaving its roost {{for only}} 30 {{minutes in the}} evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.|$|E
