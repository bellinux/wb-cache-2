40|$|Background: Anaphylaxis is an {{emergency}} condition that requires immediate, accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. However, {{little is known about}} the level of knowledge of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses treating these patients in the Emergency Department. Objective: To determine the knowledge of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses in the Emergency Department on the recent definition and treatment recommendations of anaphylaxis. Methods: We surveyed <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses of all grades in a tertiary Hospital Emergency Department using a standardized anonymous questionnaire. Results: We had a total of 190 respondents— 47 <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 143 nurses. The response rate was 79. 7 % for <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 75. 3 % for nurses. Ninety-seven point eight percent of the <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 83. 7 % of the nurses chose the accepted definition of anaphylaxis. High proportions of doctors (89 – 94 %) and nurses (65 – 72 %) diagnose anaphylaxis in the three scenarios demonstrating anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. Forty-two point six percent of the <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 76. 9 % of the nurses incorrectly diagnosed single organ involvement without hypotension as anaphylaxis. As for treatment, 89. 4 % of the doctors indicated adrenaline as the drug of choice and 85. 1 % chose intramuscular route for adrenaline administration. Among the nurses, 40. 3 % indicated adrenaline as the drug of choice and 47. 4 % chose the intramuscular route for adrenaline. Conclusion: High proportion of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, although there is a trend towards over diagnosis. There is good knowledge on drug of choice and the accepted route of adrenaline among the doctors...|$|R

Doctors are consistently rated by both <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses as the most powerful group, as well as the ultimate decision-maker. Nurses are not seen as the ultimate decision-maker. There is agreement between <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses in their perceived status of doctor, but they disagree in the perceived relative power of patients. Doctors rate patients as having more decision-making power than nurses do, whereas nurses do not perceive a significant difference between themselves <b>and</b> patients. <b>Doctors</b> rate the current power distribution as significantly more legitimate and acceptable than nurses. <b>Doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses do not differ significantly in perceived stability of the current power distribution. Doctors have a higher job satisfaction than nurses. To examine the context, ingroup and outgroup perceptions are collected; five <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> five nurses are engaged for communication validation.

40|$|Background: Pro re nata (PRN) {{prescription}} is a {{frequently used}} prescription method in hospitals. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate actual condition of PRN prescription and whether administration error occurred because of perception difference between <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses. Methods: From May to July 2012, a survey was conducted among 746 <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses (88 <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 658 nurses) working at 5 hospitals located in Seoul, Gyeong-gi, <b>and</b> Gangwon Province. <b>Doctors</b> generating PRN prescription responded to actual conditions of PRN prescription <b>and</b> both <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses reported whether administration error occurred due to perception difference. Results: Average number of PRN prescription of surgical residents was 4. 6 ± 5. 4, which was larger than that of medical residents (1. 7 ± 1. 0). Surgical residents more frequently recorded maximum number of daily intake (P = 0. 034) and, although not statistically significant, more often wrote exact single dosage (P = 0. 053) and maximum dosage per day (P = 0. 333) than medical residents. Doctors expected nurses to notify them before the administration of medication; however, nurses were more likely to conduct PRN administration by their own decision without informing doctors. In addition, some <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses experienced administration errors because of it. Conclusion: Standard prescription methods need to be established since there is a perception difference in PRN prescription between <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> nurses and this could be related to administration errors...|$|R
