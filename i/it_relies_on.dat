5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. <b>It</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It {{can be an important}} component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|Normally a {{sluggish}} species, <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> camouflage for protection. Locomotion is primarily rectilinear, using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided {{by its own}} weight for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with surprising speed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. <b>It</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> {{the very high}} rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
50|$|Although Ranford had a {{boarding}} house <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> Boddington for its services, including shopping and education.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> a Calculated Course Rating to {{determine}} how difficult the course was on the day, and upon which handicap adjustment was made.|$|R
50|$|The ND-500 was a 32-bit {{superminicomputer}} {{delivered in}} 1981 by Norsk Data. <b>It</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> a ND-100 to do housekeeping tasks {{and run the}} OS, SINTRAN III.|$|R
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. <b>It</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. <b>It</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{buildings}} from Basin's heyday form much of {{the core}} of the CDP's small business district, which includes a fire station, a post office, two restaurants, a bar, a commercial gallery, small specialty shops. Basin has a small elementary school, its own water system, and a low-power radio station. Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> the government of Jefferson County, Montana, for law enforcement and other services. From 1993 through 2011 Basin was home to the Montana Artists Refuge.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 {{the school}} {{district}} had no significant tax base. Each year <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> a voter-approved levy so the district could have funds to cover its operational expenses.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Train Robbery (1964) by John Gosling and Dennis (65-16294). The {{first book}} about the robbery, <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> the real-life {{experience}} of John Gosling, a former policeman.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{magazine}} was generally thought to be of a high quality, its paid circulation was very small and <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> numbers of free copies to increase its reach.|$|R
5|$|The rhyme is {{constructed}} of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic, (each line {{made up of}} four metrical feet of two syllables, with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair; the last foot in the line missing the unstressed syllable), which is common in nursery rhymes. In its most common form <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children's rhymes and stories. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 502.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> {{fundamental}} bugs, {{software upgrades}} made systems immune to Staog. This, combined with its {{shot in the}} dark method of transmitting itself, ensured that it died off rather quickly.|$|R
30|$|Unlike other youth {{training}} programs, {{the project}} {{did not have}} an explicit job placement service or a formal internship program. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> informal contacts with private-sector partners and partnerships with local firms.|$|R
50|$|In 1855 the {{independent}} Peebles Railway opened its line, connecting Edinburgh with Peebles. <b>It</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> the North British Railway {{for access to}} Edinburgh, but {{for the time being}} it operated its line itself.|$|R
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{paleontologist}} Mark Witton has contested this hypothesis, as <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> {{ignorance of}} pre-Greek griffin accounts and art, which have occurred considerably before the Central Asian trade scenario.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a similar}} project was {{previously}} undertaken by Timothy O'Shea, Muscarello and Dahbur noticed that problems existed with this proposed system because <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> limited pre-processing and complex algorithms {{that lead to}} computational problems.|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> reprints of 18th-century polemical {{pamphlets}} produced {{during the reign}} of Frederick the Great, whose relationship to contemporary political questions was not always immediately clear. This continued through World War One.|$|R
50|$|Warrenton was platted in 1889, and {{incorporated}} {{as a city}} in 1899. Built <b>on</b> tidal flats, <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> a system of dikes built by Chinese laborers to keep the Columbia River from flooding the town.|$|R
25|$|This {{butterfly}} {{is an avid}} mud-puddler and visitor of flowers. It basks {{with its}} wings held wide open on tufts of grass, herbs and generally keeps within a metre of the ground, even on cloudy days. <b>It</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> its quick flight for escape.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} technique using interference is interference reflection microscopy (also {{known as}} reflected interference contrast, or RIC). <b>It</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> cell adhesion to the slide {{to produce an}} interference signal.

25|$|UNICEF is not {{funded by}} the UN. Instead, <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> {{voluntary}} donations to fund its work for children worldwide. UNICEF UK raises funds for these programmes through donations, the sale of cards and gifts, partnerships with companies and special events. UNICEF UK is a registered charity.|$|E
25|$|The {{inner circle}} (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; {{that means that}} English {{language}} norms are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly New Commonwealth countries) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes {{much of the rest}} of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> the standards set by native speakers in the inner circle.|$|E
50|$|PIUS, {{standing}} for Process Inherent Ultimate Safety, was a Swedish design concept for a light-water reactor system. <b>It</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> passive measures, not requiring operator actions or external energy supplies, to provide safe operation. No units were ever built.|$|R
50|$|The {{spread of}} Green Revolution {{agriculture}} affected both agricultural biodiversity (or agrodiversity) and wild biodiversity. There is little disagreement that the Green Revolution acted to reduce agricultural biodiversity, as <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> {{just a few}} high-yield varieties of each crop.|$|R
