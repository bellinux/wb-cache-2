2500|$|Eleven {{weeks and}} one day after Hearst's death, Davies married Horace Brown on October 31, 1951, in Las Vegas. It was not a happy marriage. Davies filed for divorce twice, but neither was finalized, despite Brown admitting he treated her badly: [...] "I'm a beast," [...] he said. [...] "I took him back. I don't know why," [...] she explained. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> he's {{standing}} right beside me, crying. Thank God {{we all have a}} sense of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Business Insider Intelligence Survey {{conducted}} {{in the last quarter}} of 2014, 39% of the respondents said that security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology. In particular, as the Internet of things spreads widely, cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. In a January 2014 article in Forbes, cyber-security columnist Joseph Steinberg listed many Internet-connected appliances that can already [...] "spy on people in their own homes" [...] including televisions, kitchen appliances, cameras, and thermostats. Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely. By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. David Pogue wrote that some recently published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> of various mitigating circumstances; such as the bug that allowed the hack having been fixed before the report was published, or that the hack required security researchers having physical access to the car prior to the hack to prepare for it.|$|E

50|$|To solvers of {{crossword puzzles}} {{such as those}} of the New York Times and Los Angeles Times, natick refers to any square a solver cannot fill in {{correctly}} without <b>guessing</b> <b>because</b> the solver does not know either clue that passes through it. Such clues are generally proper nouns.|$|R
30|$|Finally, the PAPR {{reduction}} {{performance in}} terms of CCDF curve is not changed with different initial <b>guesses,</b> <b>because</b> the maximum of all 10, 000 simulated OFDM symbols defines the CCDF curve in low probability of Pr{PAPR > PAPR 0 }, and this {{does not depend on}} the initial solution. But in each OFDM symbol the minimum can be found by examination of various starting points and the performance can be improved as Figure 7 illustrates in advanced-SQP curve.|$|R
30|$|Caution {{is needed}} in {{employing}} the procedure and interpreting the results. First, the results of behavior classification rely on the RT thresholds and are not meaningful unless the identified thresholds are validated. Second, the procedure is employed to identify general rapid-guessing behavior, not specific to rapid guessing due to disengagement with the test or due to test speededness. We did not further differentiate {{the two types of}} rapid <b>guessing</b> <b>because</b> of the very low percent of SB = 0, implying an even smaller percent due to either type. In applications in which it is necessary to distinguish one type from the other, one may examine the total section/test time of the students with lower RTE as a rough estimate of time pressure. Last but not least, the line of research we followed assumes that students with rapid-guessing behavior show very short RTs. Short RTs alone do not indicate rapid <b>guesses</b> <b>because</b> students with pre-knowledge on items may have short RTs but high accuracy. However, long RTs might result from no engagement with the items and distraction by unrelated activities, rather than high engagement. Our analysis may be supplemented with process data gathered from log files to gain more comprehensive understanding about individual test-taking behaviors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} {{a method for}} generating a particular permutation P of a given size N out of N! permutations from a given key. This method computes a unique permutation for a specific size since it takes the same key; therefore, the same permutation can be computed each time the same key and size are applied. The name of random permutation {{comes from the fact}} that the probability of getting this permutation is 1 out of N! possible permutations. Beside that, the permutation can not be <b>guessed</b> <b>because</b> of its generating method that is depending completely on a given key and size...|$|R
50|$|A {{criticism}} of the Rasch model {{is that it is}} overly restrictive or prescriptive because it does not permit each item to have a different discrimination. A criticism specific to the use of multiple choice items in educational assessment {{is that there is no}} provision in the model for <b>guessing</b> <b>because</b> the left asymptote always approaches a zero probability in the Rasch model. These variations are available in models such as the two and three parameter logistic models. However, the specification of uniform discrimination and zero left asymptote are necessary properties of the model in order to sustain sufficiency of the simple, unweighted raw score.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} oligopolistic model of price {{competition}} to environments with multiple goods, heterogeneous consumers, and arbitrary continuous cost functions. A Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies with an endogenous sharing rule {{is proven to}} exist. It is also shown that, in environments with fixed costs and constant marginal costs, all (symmetric and asymmetric) equilibria exhibit price dispersion across stores. Furthermore, the paper identifies scenarios in which prices will necessarily be random. In these markets, stores keep each other <b>guessing</b> <b>because,</b> given the fixed costs, they would incur a loss if their price strategies were anticipated and beaten by competitors. This is interpreted as an important economic feature that is possibly behind random price promotions such as weekly specials.

30|$|Human beings use {{two methods}} {{for dealing with}} NL sentences: {{guessing}} and deep understanding. Small children use <b>guessing</b> <b>because</b> their brains have an incomplete and imprecise model of the world, {{they do not know}} the exact meaning(s) of words, and they have not learned the language grammar. In this case they sometimes grasp the correct meaning of a sentence and sometimes do not. Conversely, lawyers can not afford to guess the meaning of law articles, they have to understand their exact meaning in order to determine if an article can be useful for a specific legal issue. In general, human beings use a combination of guessing and understanding. In our NLIDB we are trying to replicate the process performed by lawyers, or more precisely, the process carried out by a DB administrator when understanding a NL query for translating it into SQL.|$|R
5000|$|C.J. Wilson: He {{has claimed}} that he throws the gyroball. However, just as his two-seam ball, it is {{sometimes}} very similar to a slider or sinker {{in spite of his}} adoption of Tezuka's theory; he cannot control it. He <b>guesses</b> <b>because</b> the gyro axle is inclined in irregularity. But while trying to learn the gyro, Wilson developed a new hybrid pitch, which he calls the Cork. The Cork, described by Wilson, is a [...] "rising cut fastball." [...] He uses this as his out pitch against left-handed hitters. In the ALCS 2010 Game 1 press conference on October 14, 2010, he said he doesn't believe it's very good for the arm, so he doesn't throw it very much. His two surgeries took place after he began throwing it. However, he does throw it if he feels confident and is having a successful outing.|$|R

I am at the present moment altogether in the dark as to what I shall do with myself when to-morrow evening comes.

6000|$|That is my guess: and I {{think it}} is a good <b>guess,</b> <b>because</b> I have asked Madam How a hundred {{different}} questions about it in the last ten years, and she always answered them in the same way, saying, [...] "Water, water, you stupid man." [...] But I do not want you merely to depend on what I say.

60|$|In {{the bleak}} weather of this spring, 1842, he was again abroad {{for a little}} while; partly from necessity, or at least utility; and partly, as I <b>guess,</b> <b>because</b> these {{circumstances}} favored, and he could with a good countenance indulge a little wish he had long had. In the Italian Tour, which ended suddenly by Mrs. Sterling's illness recalling him, he had missed Naples; a loss which he always thought to be considerable; and which, from time to time, he had formed little projects, failures hitherto, for supplying. The rigors of spring were always dangerous to him in England, {{and it was always}} of advantage to get out of them: and then the sight of Naples, too; this, always a thing to be done some day, was now possible. Enough, with the real or imaginary hope of bettering himself in health, and the certain one of seeing Naples, and catching a glance of Italy again, he now made a run thither. It was not long after Calvert's death. The Tragedy of Strafford lay finished in his desk. Several things, sad and bright, were finished. A little intermezzo of ramble was not unadvisable.|$|E

40|$|Information about {{population}} age structures {{is useful}} to understand survival rates, longevity, and population turnover. However, little such information is available about wolf (Canis lupus) populations. Mech (1970) estimated age structures of wolf-population age structure from pup:adult ratios applying various demographic assumptions, but no direct information has been published to test his estimate. Mech et al. (1998) aged 94 live wolves darted in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA, but the estimates of wolf ages were based on educated <b>guesses</b> <b>because</b> no technique was available for aging live wolves. Since then, Gipson et al. (2000) published criteria for aging live wolves based on tooth wear of known-aged animals. This method allows data to be gathered from populations of live animals, which can facilitate examination of the age structure of populations. My objective was to use this method to estimate the age structure of a population of wolves in the Superior National Forest (SNF) of northeastern Minnesota, USA...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} human society is that individuals have intuitive beliefs about how {{various aspects of}} their environment (physical, social, etc.) correlate to other aspects. This paper tests {{the hypothesis that the}} mathematical environment can give rise to multiple clusters of beliefs when those beliefs concern the degree of co-relatedness between variables. Simulations were conducted demonstrating that when the sample size is extremely small (i. e., 3), the sampling distribution of correlations is either U-shaped (for distributions of the Pearson r) or W-shaped (for distributions of signed r 2). Behavioral data indicated distributions that tended to approximate a W shape. There was also evidence that when people <b>guessed,</b> <b>because</b> they felt they could not extract any useful information from the sample, they were biased to guess that the population correlation was zero. The findings support the hypothesis that a natural, multi-clustering of sample correlations leads to a multi-clustering of beliefs about the population correlation...|$|R
