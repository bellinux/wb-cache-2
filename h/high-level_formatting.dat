Since users generally have no way to determine the difference between a complete LLF and reinitialization (they simply observe running the software results in a hard disk that must be <b>high-level</b> <b>formatted),</b> both the misinformed user and mixed signals from various drive manufacturers have perpetuated this error.

However, under some file systems (e.g., NTFS, but not FAT), the file indexes (such as $MFTs under NTFS, inodes under ext2/3, etc.) may not be written to the same exact locations.

40|$|Abstract: XML (Extensible Markup Language) {{has become}} the lingua franca for {{information}} integration, e-Business and metadata. It is also invading to office documents and hence becoming the format for organizational and end-user documents. XML documents themselves do not contain information about styling, i. e., how they should be rendered for print, screen, or other channels of publication. One document type may need numerous styling definitions as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) or XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) stylesheets for differing multi-channel publishing purposes. Producing style definitions with differing styling languages may be quite tricky for end-users. The management of a myriad of formatting definitions may pose challenges for organizations as well. Tools for defining CSS style definitions are available but the support for differing versions of CSS on different end-user devices may be varying. Use of XSL requires programming skills or applications providing graphical user interfaces for XSL.

It is shown, for a bit-error-rate (BER) of 10 - 3, 2000 km of quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) DP-MBOFDM transmission is feasible.

For a 100 Gb/s DP-MB-OFDM system, a high number of subcarriers contribute to improved BER but at the cost of digital signal processing computational complexity, whilst by adapting the cyclic prefix length the BER can be improved for a low number of subcarriers. In addition, when 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM) is employed the digital-toanalogue/ analogue-to-digital converter (DAC/ADC) bandwidth is relaxed with a degraded BER; while the 'circular' 8 QAM is slightly superior to its 'rectangular' form.

To increase efficiency of spectral resource in bit rate per Hz (bit/s/Hz), <b>high-level</b> modulation <b>formats</b> are used, challenged by the accompanying optical impairments and the resulting limitation of optical reach. Previous work has {{addressed the issue of}} optical reach and transmission fault tolerance in the physical layer by deploying various FEC schemes and by a careful design of optical transceivers and links.

We show that high-speed QPSK, 8 PSK, 8 QAM, and 16 QAM can all be gen-erated using commercially available optical modulators using only binary electrical drive signals through novel synthesis methods, and {{that all of these}} modulation formats can be detected using a universal receiver front-end and digital coherent detection. We show that the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), which is highly effective for blind polarization recovery of PDM-QPSK and PDM- 8 PSK signals, is much less effective for PDM- 8 QAM and PDM- 16 QAM. We then present a recently proposed, cascaded multi-modulus algorithm for these cases. In addition to the DSP algorithms used for constellation recovery, we also describe a DSP algorithm to improve the performance of a coherent receiver using single-ended photo-detection.
