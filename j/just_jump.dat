500|$|The {{popularity}} of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Nickelodeon also expanded the merchandising of the show, bringing it around $500 million revenue. It was reported that SpongeBob-themed goods are the best-selling character merchandise at Hot Topic store at Park City Center. T-shirts, pillows, shoelaces, pins, sunglasses, and air fresheners were sold [...] "extremely well if they have SpongeBob's likeness on them," [...] said Erin Aguirre, lead sales associate of Hot Topic. He added [...] " [...] come in and they <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> right into it. [...] "Did you see last week's episode?' They totally talk all about it, just that it's funny, that it's hilarious." ...|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
2500|$|Girls Aloud {{worked closely}} with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and {{production}} team Xenomania throughout their career. Xenomania produced all of Girls Aloud's albums and singles, excluding nine songs from their debut album Sound of the Underground, the charity single [...] "Walk This Way" [...] and two songs from Ten. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud's former manager Louis Walsh says, [...] "He just makes great songs for radio. They <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> out at you and stay in your brain." [...] In {{a review of the}} group's debut single [...] "Sound of the Underground", The Guardians Alexis Petridis exclaimed it [...] "proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture." [...] In response to Girls Aloud's debut album, Jacqueline Hodges of BBC Music said that [...] "Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2005, the group convened in a collaboration with Castle Music to decide on songs for a retrospective. Juggernaut Rides '89–'98 compiled 33 tracks remastered from the original DATs (almost half of which being non-album tracks) and was released on 14 March 2005. The two-CD anthology featured four previously unreleased songs, including Shake Appeal's [...] "Son of Mustang Ford" [...] demo from 1989 and the remainder of Swervedriver's 1998 recordings, [...] "Just Sometimes" [...] and the orchestral string accompanied [...] "Neon Lights Glow". Regarding the production effort for Juggernaut Rides, Franklin told Tape Op magazine, [...] "Me and Jimmy sat there [...] and said, 'Wow this is pretty great.' You do forget things about the various tracks," [...] and said to Australia's The Vine, [...] "I quite {{like the fact that}} it’s not chronologically laid out, so you <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> straight into the middle." [...] Reviews touted it as [...] "Swervedriver's beautiful corpse" [...] and asserted that it [...] "proves they were so much more than just another underachieving T-shirt band." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{medley of}} [...] "Kansas City" [...] and [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey" [...] was sequenced {{as the final}} song on side one of the LP. In McCartney's description, his {{performance}} on the track required [...] "a great deal of nerve to <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> up and scream like an idiot"; his efforts were egged on by Lennon, who [...] "would go, 'Come on! You can sing it better than that, man! Come on, come on! Really throw it!'" [...] The medley was inspired by Little Richard, who similarly combined Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Kansas City" [...] with his own composition, [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!" [...] Riley considers that, although McCartney's presence on Beatles for Sale appears relatively slight next to Lennon's, his performance of [...] "Kansas City" [...] goes some way to readdressing the balance. Hertsgaard says that the irony evident in Harrison's delivery of [...] "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby" [...] "allows the Beatles to close the album with a not-so-veiled comment on the oddities of living inside Beatlemania".|$|E
2500|$|Vector Unit had {{contemplated}} simply porting {{the original}} Hydro Thunder to the Xbox 360, {{as they had}} been given the source code to the original game. They felt that given they would have to update all of the assets and that they had already built the water system, {{the decision was made to}} continue building the title from the ground up. The original source code was used for reference, and the Vector Unit [...] "played the heck out of the original game to refresh our memories." [...] The boats and environments were redesigned, taking cues from the original, but accommodating the new physics system and updated graphics engine. [...] The developers contemplated things such as boat customization and user-generated tracks, but [...] "ultimately we felt that it was more important to present an accessible, hand-crafted experience that players can <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> into and have fun with." [...] On May 1, 2012 Vector Unit announced that the game would be available for Windows 8 via Microsoft's Windows Store when the operating system is released. It joins other ports of popular Xbox 360 Xbox Live Arcade titles such as Ms. Splosion Man, Toy Soldiers and Ilomilo.|$|E

2500|$|Hopkins {{was nervous}} prior to going on stage, but since {{that night he}} has relaxed, quoting his mentor: [...] "He [...] said: 'Remember: nerves is [...] vanity – you’re {{wondering}} what people think of you; to hell with them, <b>just</b> <b>jump</b> off the edge’. It was great advice.” Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 BBC broadcast of A Flea in Her Ear. His first starring role in a film came in 1964 in Changes, a short directed by Drewe Henley, written and produced by James Scott and co-starring Jacqueline Pearce. In 1968, he got his break in The Lion in Winter playing King Richard the Lionheart. Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in Pravda by David Hare and Howard Brenton and as Antony in Antony and Cleopatra opposite Judi Dench {{as well as in}} the Broadway production of Peter Shaffer's Equus) he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. He portrayed Charles Dickens in the BBC television film The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens in 1970, and Pierre Bezukhov in the BBC's mini series War and Peace (1972). Making a name for himself as a screen actor, in 1972 he starred as British politician David Lloyd George in Young Winston, and in 1977 he played British Army officer John Frost in the World War II-set film A Bridge Too Far. Both of these films were directed by Richard Attenborough, who described Hopkins as “unquestionably the greatest actor of his generation”.|$|E

Right then he had an idea. Why shouldn't he learn to jump? He could try, anyway. So when he was sure that no one was around to see him, he practised jumping over little low bushes. At first he couldn't do much, but he kept trying and trying, and little by little he jumped higher. It was hard work, and he scraped his slim legs many times when he tried to jump over old logs and stumps.|$|E
