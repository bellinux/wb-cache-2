5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions specified by aspects (isolated representations of a significant concepts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>program)</b> and generate the final implementation code. The weaver integrates aspects into the locations specified by the software as a pre-compilation step. By merging aspects and classes (representations {{of the structure of}} entities in the program), the weaver generates a woven class.|$|E
5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory {{address of the}} operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E

He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby.
