5|$|P. labiata usually lays <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the}} top of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> it, and then cover the eggs.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi usually lays <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the}} top of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> it, and then cover the eggs. P. schultzi has been seen laying eggs in a rolled-up leaf in a web of Ischnothele karschi.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E

5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> it, and then cover the eggs. In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays eggs in a dead leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females {{lay their}} <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, {{digging into the}} {{petioles}} and stems. After emerging in late summer, they pupate in soil.|$|E
5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of}} the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E

5|$|The {{broad bean}} weevil, B. rufimanus is univoltine. It reproduces in spring in faba bean crops, lays <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the young pods, {{develops}} {{in the growing}} seeds and overwinters as adults in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.|$|E
5|$|The female lays {{eight to}} {{thirteen}} creamy white to greenish-buff spotless <b>eggs,</b> <b>on</b> alternate days. Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days. The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming {{as soon as}} they hatch.|$|E
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E

5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> land.|$|E

5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate seasonally {{and return to the}} sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E

5|$|Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at {{the base}} of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April. Fertilisation has not been {{observed}} in this species, but most reptant decapods mate with the ventral surfaces together. Between July and August, females carry around 100,000 <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> their enlarged, feathery pleopods. The eggs develop from being a bright orange colour to a dark brown before being shed into the water after around 16 days of development. There is normally only one generation per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{life span}} of P.fluviatile is {{typically}} 10–12 years. Moulting does not occur in winter. Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August. Females carry the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> their pleopods (appendages on the abdomen) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs, having passed through the larval stages inside the egg.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} leisure spots and {{conservation}} areas are available around Sandakan. The Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary {{is a place}} where orphaned or injured orangutans are brought to be rehabilitated to return to forest life. Established in 1964, it is one of only four orangutan sanctuaries in the world. Other conservation areas are the Malaysian Turtle Islands where many turtles lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the islands. They cover an area of 1,740 hectares which includes the surrounding reefs and seas. The islands are also ideal for swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving.|$|E
