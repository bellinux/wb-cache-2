5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an easy target to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E

Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola {{in order to win}} his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.|$|E

The meeting took place near Imatra, in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.|$|E

At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He said to Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> vanity to others, but he did not think it so.|$|E
25|$|It must <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> déjà vu {{all over}} again for England as they started day two, with Australia again poised for a large total. Border and Jones resumed and added a further 20 before Border was caught behind of Capel for 76. Jones was finally removed for 122, and Steve Waugh, who seemed to have gone off the boil {{slightly}} following his blistering first three tests, went for a disappointing 14, clean bowled by Igglesden. Rain interrupted temporarily, but play soon resumed, and the South London crowd was then treated with a blistering display of low-order hitting from Queensland-born keeper Ian Healy, who battered 44 off 44 balls. His innings lasted less than an hour and contained six 4s, also taking the Australian total past 400 for the sixth time in as many tests. Eventually he fell, caught behind of the bowling of Derek Pringle, who then proceeded to tear into the tail, collecting the last four wickets. Although Trevor Hohns (30) and Merv Hughes (21) lasted long enough to take the Australian total to 468, the tourists were all out shortly before stumps. Enough play was left to force England to face an awkward few overs, and the Australians made the most of it, dislodging Graham Gooch LBW to Alderman for a third ball duck. England finished the day on 1 for 1, both not out batsmen yet to score.|$|E
500|$|Author and {{prominent}} spiritualist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle {{learned of the}} photographs from {{the editor of the}} spiritualist publication Light. Doyle had been commissioned by The Strand Magazine to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue, and the fairy photographs [...] "must <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a godsend" [...] according to broadcaster and historian Magnus Magnusson. Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was [...] "obviously impressed" [...] that Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be [...] "soiled" [...] by money.|$|E

500|$|Inglis {{notes that}} almost every account of the {{significance}} of Sgt. Pepper emphasizes the cover's [...] "unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space". After its release, album sleeves were no longer [...] "a superfluous thing to be discarded during the act of listening, but an integral component of the listening that expanded the musical experience." [...] The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the [...] "structures and cultures of popular music" [...] could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that – before Sgt. Pepper – would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> [...] "fanciful conceit". He writes: Sgt. Pepper [...] "cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit." [...] Riley describes it as [...] "one of the best-known works that pop art ever produced". In the late 1990s, the BBC included it in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design. In 2008, the iconic bass drum skin used on the front cover sold at auction for €670,000.|$|E
500|$|While {{this may}} <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good plan, Jourdan's choice of ground created {{problems}} for him later. The plain below Pfullendorf was riddled with such streams and brooks as the Ostrach, a Danube tributary, which drained {{out of the}} marshes and swamps of Pfrungenried; {{in the spring of}} most years, this was not the best choice of ground. Although from Pfullendorf and the more moderate heights {{to the north of the}} village of Ostrach, Jourdan could establish reasonable artillery positions, the softness of the marshland itself would diminish the impact of a cannonade on the Austrian line. The marsh was also prone to fogginess, which would hinder visual planning and tactics. Furthermore, the softness of the ground would make the use of cavalry difficult, and cavalry maneuvers would be made more difficult by the likelihood of fog. Finally, the major part of Charles' army had wintered immediately east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. [...] This was less than [...] distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and a traverse through friendly territory.|$|E
500|$|The other {{performance}} by Criss and Bomer, the Duran Duran mashup of [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] and [...] "Rio", {{was given a}} modestly positive reception. Strecker gave it an [...] and called it a [...] "real treat" [...] with [...] "some truly fun choreography". Slezak, on the other hand, described the choreography as [...] "peculiar", and graded the song a [...] "B". Sullivan wrote, [...] "On paper it may not <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the best idea, but honestly, it kind of rocked." [...] Chaney noted that [...] "they were fun to watch", but gave the performance a [...] "C"; she said that [...] "something about this cover sucked all the cherry ice cream smile out of the originals", though she wondered whether she was biased by her [...] "lifelong appreciation of Duran Duran". The solo by Criss on [...] "Fighter" [...] received {{a wider range of}} opinions. Both Chaney and Slezak gave the song a [...] Chaney said he sang the song [...] "with conviction" [...] and complimented the [...] "visually alluring" [...] boxing and shower scenes, as did Slezak. Strecker wrote that [...] "the energy and emotional punch totally resonated" [...] and gave the song an [...] though she also stated that [...] "the talk-singing at the beginning was a little weird". Votta said that [...] "vocally, Darren Criss embodies the song", but she characterized the staging as [...] "too jagged and haphazard to make an impact", and the transitions not [...] "as smooth as they could be". Flandez called the song choice [...] "unsuitable" [...] and [...] "puzzling", and VanDerWerff said the performance was [...] "completely ridiculous".|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "The poet is a lucid one, a modern one, who [...] demystifies, demythifies and desacralizes poetry's old themes." [...] Caragiale's generic interest was in adapting to poetry the elements of [...] "bad taste" [...] in popular culture, of kitsch aesthetics and the banal.|$|E

A sophomore girl, Jessie Mary Boulton, who observed her {{wrote in a letter}} back home: [...] "There is one that I think will make quite a stir. Her name is Gage and she is lively." [...] Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz remarked that [...] "ively may <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a compliment of sorts but it was a code word for trouble". A girl characterized as [...] "lively" [...] would have a difficult time in college and was likely to produce gossip.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the time}} he was {{studying}} the Qur'an, Stevens began to identify more and more with the story of Joseph, a man bought and sold in the market place, which is how he said he had increasingly felt within the music business. Regarding his conversion, in his 2006 interview with Alan Yentob, he stated, [...] "to some people, it may <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an enormous jump, but for me, it was a gradual move to this." [...] And, in a Rolling Stone magazine interview, he reaffirmed this, saying, [...] "I had found the spiritual home I'd been seeking for most of my life.

[...] To compound the command problems created by the terrain, McPherson's men were operating under drum and bugle silence and orders had to be delivered by courier, causing the line to lurch forward unevenly. [...] The men of the 23rd Indiana Infantry Regiment experienced what must <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a stroke of luck at the time—because of a turn in the creek, their right flank rested very near the creek. [...] With a little effort, the unit was across the creek and standing in formation. [...] In order to close the gap created by the march, the unit quick-stepped back the other direction looking {{for the rest of the}} brigade, and stumbled sideways into the jaws of the Confederate trap. The only thing that saved the 23rd Indiana Infantry from wholesale slaughter was the fact that the Confederates had never been issued bayonets.|$|E

2500|$|Brooks created other {{versions}} of Iolanthe, including an alto-relievo which was {{exhibited at the}} Centennial Exposition– the 1876 world's fair held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her butter sculpture, in the Women's Pavilion, attracted huge crowds. She was invited {{to move from the}} Women's Pavilion to the main exhibit space in order to demonstrate her sculpting skills. This was an honor, but there may have been an additional motivation behind the invitation. There were often suspicions and accusations during this time period that female artists in general did not actually create the works for which they were taking credit. As a demonstration that she had, in fact, sculpted the piece, she created another head, in about ninety minutes, for a panel which included Exposition officials and members of the press. Observers were impressed both by the quick performance using crude instruments to sculpt in an unusual medium and by the artistic qualities of the finished work. One guidebook proclaimed Dreaming Iolanthe to be [...] the [...] "most beautiful and unique exhibit in the Centennial". Even though the circumstances of the demonstration may <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a stunt, Brooks was largely considered to be a serious artist whose creations should be regarded similarly to work sculpted using more traditional methods and materials. Commentary about her piece said that [...] "the difficulties attached to the employment of such a material should be taken into account, while it must be conceded that, whatever material the artist employs, the work itself is one exhibiting a high degree of talent, a fine ideal feeling, as well as exceeding delicacy and brilliancy of manipulation." ...|$|E
