5|$|Although the {{strictly}} Protestant James <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> {{to end the}} practice, {{he found}} himself having to touch {{an increasing number of}} people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E
5|$|Hervey le Breton (also {{known as}} Hervé le Breton; died 30 August 1131) was a Breton cleric who became Bishop of Bangor in Wales and later Bishop of Ely in England. Appointed to Bangor by King William II of England, when the Normans were {{advancing}} into Wales, Hervey {{was unable to}} remain in his diocese when the Welsh began to drive the Normans back from their recent conquests. Hervey's behaviour towards the Welsh seems to have contributed to his expulsion from his see. Although the new king, Henry <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to translate Hervey to the see of Lisieux in Normandy, it was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Early on, Casanova {{demonstrated}} a quick wit, an intense appetite for knowledge, and a perpetually inquisitive mind. He entered the University of Padua at twelve and graduated at seventeen, in 1742, {{with a degree}} in law ("for which I felt an unconquerable aversion"). It was his guardian's hope that he would become an ecclesiastical lawyer. Casanova had also studied moral philosophy, chemistry, and mathematics, and was keenly interested in medicine. ("I should have been allowed to do as <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> and become a physician, in which profession quackery is even more effective than it is in legal practice.") He frequently prescribed his own treatments for himself and friends. While attending the university, Casanova began to gamble and quickly got into debt, causing his recall to Venice by his grandmother, but the gambling habit became firmly established.|$|E

500|$|Peale married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} to Eliza Greatrake, contracted in 1815 {{while he was still}} a minor, produced one daughter, Anna, who survived him. [...] His second, childless, marriage was to Caroline Girard Haslam, a widow, and the niece of the wealthy Stephen Girard; it lasted from 1839 to his death. He enjoyed the company of children, making toys by his own hand for them. Peale was in declining health in his final months, but was still able to continue his activities, and only a short illness preceded his death at his home at 1131 Girard Street in Philadelphia, on May 5, 1870. His final words were, [...] "If this is death, it is as <b>I</b> <b>wished,</b> perfect peace, perfect comfort, perfect joy." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton biographer Ken Hanke {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of Dolores Fuller. [...] "The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman," [...] Hanke said, [...] "while Parker's performance presents her {{as a kind of}} sitcom moron for {{the first part of the}} film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes." [...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> they could have made it a deeper love story, because we really loved each other. We strove to find investors together, I worked so hard to support Ed and I." ...|$|E
500|$|Lutosławski's works {{up until}} and {{including}} the Dance Preludes clearly show the influence of Polish folk music, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the Concerto for Orchestra. As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, [...] " [...] I could not compose as <b>I</b> <b>wished,</b> so I composed as I was able", and about this change of direction he said, [...] "I was simply not so interested in it [...] ". Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a [...] "post-tonal" [...] idiom: while composing the first symphony, he {{felt that this was}} for him a cul-de-sac.|$|E

500|$|The Dream Lord {{describes}} the Doctor sarcastically as [...] "The Oncoming Storm", a name coined by his archenemies the Daleks, and first {{mentioned in the}} Seventh Doctor novel Love and War and subsequently on-screen in [...] "The Parting of the Ways", where it was attributed to the Daleks. He also says to the Doctor, [...] "You're probably a vegetarian!" [...] in a butcher's shop and calls him [...] "veggie", referring to The Two Doctors, in which the Sixth Doctor announced that he and Peri would eat a vegetarian diet from then on. The Dream Lord also teases the Doctor's relationship with Elizabeth I. This began in [...] "The Shakespeare Code" [...] where Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to behead the Doctor and continued in The End of Time, which alluded to the possibility the two were married.

500|$|Santer, {{who stood}} down as {{executive}} producer after the episode's transmission, succeeded by Bryan Kirkwood, commented {{that he was}} happy, relieved and proud with the broadcast. Santer stated: [...] "I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight—the cast, the crew, everyone. It's everything <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> for and more. I'm thrilled with how it went. It was quite remarkable. Everything went to plan. I spotted a couple of little wobbles but what I was proudest of was the recovery. The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round." [...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner {{was surprised to learn}} that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. I think that's going to hurt her more than anything." ...|$|E

[...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported.

500|$|Moondance was {{released}} by Warner Bros. on 27 January 1970 in the United Kingdom and on 28 February 1970 in the United States, receiving immediate acclaim from critics. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau claimed that Morrison had finally fulfilled his artistic potential: [...] "Forget Astral Weeks—this is a brilliant, catchy, poetic, and completely successful LP." [...] Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in Rolling Stone, hailing it {{as a work of}} [...] "musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of 'Into the Mystic' and the fine, epic brilliance of 'Caravan' will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years." [...] Fellow Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau found the singer's vocals overwhelming: [...] "Things fell into place so perfectly <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it." [...] Ralph J. Gleason from the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote of Morrison's singing as a focal point of praise: [...] "He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the old folks in every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines." ...|$|E
500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; it was what <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (Ständeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{most notable}} {{action in the}} House was a speech he made on February4, 1875, in {{response}} to Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler's call to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Referring to comments Butler had made the previous day about lawlessness against African-Americans in the South, Brown claimed that unjust charges had been made against Southerners by an individual [...] "who is outlawed {{in his own home}} by respectable society, whose name is synonymous with falsehood, who is the champion, and has been on all occasions, of fraud; who is the apologist of thieves, who is such a prodigy of vice and meanness that to describe him would sicken the imagination and exhaust invective." [...] Brown continued by referencing notorious Scottish murderer William Burke, whose method of murdering his victims became known as [...] "Burking." [...] At this point in the speech, Speaker of the House James G. Blaine interrupted Brown, asking if he was referring to a member of the House; Brown gave an ambiguous response before continuing: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to describe all that was pusillanimous in war, inhuman in peace, forbidden in morals, and infamous in politics, I should call it 'Butlerizing'." [...] The House gallery exploded in protest at Brown's remark, and incensed Republican legislators called for Brown's immediate expulsion. Though not expelled, he was officially censured by the House for the use of unparliamentary language. The censure was expunged from the record by a subsequent Congress.|$|E
