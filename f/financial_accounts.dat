However, the majority (82%) of overseas US persons filing owe no tax to the US (due to tax treaties). At the congressional hearing on 26 April 2017, Congressman Mark Meadows stated that according to FATCA's drafters themselves, FATCA would, at most, reduce tax evasion by less than 1% (i.e. recoup less than $1billion out of an estimated $100billion in lost revenue). In contrast, he said, normal enforcement activities create a return of $20 for every $1 spent. Because $200million is being spent to implement FATCA in FY2017, the IRS commissioner’s own estimates show that just shifting the money from FATCA to general enforcement would increase tax revenues by over $1billion.|$|E

As part of a series of moves to block the Catalan referendum, prosecutors had also instructed police officials to seize ballot boxes, election flyers and other items that could be of use in the illegal vote, whereas the Constitutional Court had instructed regional government officials to show how they were preventing the vote from going ahead within a 48-hour deadline.
