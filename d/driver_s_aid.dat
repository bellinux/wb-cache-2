40|$|Considered as Israel’s strongest ally, the United States {{has long}} {{maintained}} {{a special relationship}} with Israel. The alliance has remained strong even through challenges such as war, terrorism, and global opinions against Israel. Throughout the lengthy Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the United States has made Israel the top annual recipient of its foreign aid. In addition, the United States defends Israel from accusations regarding the legality of its actions toward Palestine and the Palestinian people. In this paper, I argue that U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> to Israel is predicated on domestic political and special interest concerns. Specifically, I argue that increases in aid to Israel {{are the result of}} the increases in the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. Furthermore, despite previous research contending that U.

40|$|This paper explores how U. <b>S.</b> {{bilateral}} economic <b>aid</b> {{has changed}} over time, focusing on how the recent era-in which the War on Terror has played {{a prominent role in}} the Bush administration's aid policy-differs from previous eras. In particular, has the renewed geopolitical role of aid coincided with a reduction of aid to the poorest countries or less weight on need in U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> allocation decisions? We start with an analysis of annual U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> budgets from 1955 to 2006. Controlling for domestic political and economic conditions, we find that the War on Terror's effect on the aid budget is significantly larger than is immediately apparent. To explore how the emphasis on need may have changed over time, we use country-level panel data on aid allocations to 119 countries across the same time period. This shows that U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> flows-for the poorest as well as other developing countries-increased with the War on Terror. However, after rising for 35 Â years, the emphasis placed on need has been falling steadily for core aid recipients during the War on Terror. Cold War Foreign aid United States War on Terror...|$|R
40|$|Foreign aid {{has been}} a signal {{component}} of United States foreign policy since {{the creation of the}} Marshall Plan. Since that time, as new requirements emerged, numerous foreign aid programs and initiatives were created and subsequently piecemealed together under various U. S. agencies. The confluence of programs, initiatives, and agencies has created a confusing and overly bureaucratized environment for expending funds in an effort to support the democratization and modernization of other countries. This study examines U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> provided to Ukraine and Georgia to determine if they have progressed toward Westernized defense and military structures, in accordance with their stated national goals, within the realm of logistics.

40|$|This project 2 ̆ 7 s {{main purpose}} is to address the {{question}} of U. <b>S.</b> foreign <b>aid</b> transfers to the Third World. Previous studies attempting to demonstrate a causal relationship between U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> and Third World compliance have largely resulted in disappointment. Most studies conclude U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> does not lead to compliant behavior from LDCs. However, this project opts to reverse the causal direction so that we consider the impact of compliance on aid donations. In doing so we create a new framework conceived as a form of 2 ̆ 2 patron-cliency. 2 ̆ 2 ^ By combining elements of dependency theory, comparative foreign policy, and anthropology, this new patron-cliency framework enhances our understanding of foreign policy interactions between LDCs and more powerful states. Moreover, patron-cliency 2 ̆ 7 s ability to explain and predict large state-LDC interactions improves upon that of dependency theory. ^ To test this framework we analyzed foreign aid transfers from the U. S. to the Third World. It was our belief that states with higher levels of cliency (as measured by the presence of affectivity, asymmetry, compliance, and reciprocity) toward the United States would receive more aid than states that displayed lower levels of cliency. The patron-client framework proved to be useful in explaining aid transfers to the Third World generally, and to certain regions specifically. Patron-cliency explained nearly seventy {{percent of the variance in}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> transfers to the Mideast and East Asia, while explaining nearly fifty-five percent of the aid transfers to Africa. ^ These findings have several implications. First, they suggest that the relationships between patrons and clients are extremely complex, rarely revolving on a single issue. Second, U. <b>S.</b> foreign <b>aid</b> transfers to the Third World are influenced by myriad factors, and that aid is not used to 2 ̆ 2 purchase 2 ̆ 2 compliant behavior from recipient states. Third, previous scholars who sought to establish a causal link between U. <b>S.</b> <b>aid</b> and LDC compliance have misconceived the true nature of aid relationships. And four, patron-cliency is a useful concept for explaining large and small state behavior. ...|$|R
