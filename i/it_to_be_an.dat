5|$|Upon release, Sonic Colors {{received}} positive reviews. Critics {{recommended the}} title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> improvement over previous installments. However, some voiced criticism {{of its high}} difficulty level and a weak multiplayer mode. The title {{would go on to}} be a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in Sonic Colors would go on to become a staple of the Sonic series, and have featured in various games across the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Workers {{building}} an extension to the London Underground at Hobbs End dig up skeletal remains. Palaeontologist Dr Matthew Roney (James Donald) is called in and deduces {{that they are}} the remnants of a group of five-million-year-old apemen, more ancient than any previous finds. One of Roney's assistants uncovers part of a metallic object. Believing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unexploded bomb, they call in an army bomb disposal team.|$|E
5|$|Workmen {{discover}} a pre-human skull while {{building in the}} fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob's Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the Devil) in Knightsbridge, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, {{something that looks like}} a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted because the military believe <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unexploded Second World War bomb.|$|E
5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> official language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first Briar Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E
5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which agrees with several other recent analyses. If a stem-based definition is used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore basal abelisaurids. However, as they are more basal than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based definition is adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, {{so it was not}} included in Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, shows <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> abelisaurid.|$|E
50|$|Acidity drew extreme {{responses}} from readers {{when it first}} appeared on chowk.com. Some thought <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> work of ingenious satire, while others thought <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> work of a crank. However, over the years, it {{has grown into a}} cybercult classic among many young Indians and Pakistanis. But it still gets flack for itself being so extreme while attacking the extremes of capitalism and organized religion.|$|R

5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock to climb up on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|Paltrow's guest {{appearance}} attracted positive commentary, but the episode's sub-plots {{were less}} well received. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed the episode {{one of the}} best of the season. Time James Poniewozik felt that it was a relatively subdued, mediocre episode, and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> improvement on the previous two episodes, if not genuinely good. The National Alliance on Mental Illness criticized the episode for its depiction of bipolar disorder. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance.|$|E
5|$|Ruby & Sapphire has {{received}} generally positive reception. It was well received {{when it was}} revealed at E3 by publications such as IGN and GameSpy. Its release was similarly well received, with Metacritic and GameRankings giving it aggregate scores of 82 and 80.83% respectively. It has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide, and {{has received}} significant praise from review outlets such as Nintendo Power, GamePro, and IGN, the latter awarding it the Game Boy Advance Game of the Month award for August 2003. In spite of the positive reception, some reviewers found <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> inferior pinball experience, such as TechTV and The Guardian, though felt that Pokémon fans would enjoy it.|$|E

5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review {{found it to}} be a good film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in the}} accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had found <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> assured way to reach orgasm. McKinnis {{recommended the}} Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded vibrators in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the Magic Wand. A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping tried the Magic Wand for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> especially early example dating to {{the first part of}} the Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E
