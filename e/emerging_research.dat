25|$|<b>Emerging</b> <b>research</b> {{suggests}} that gay men from religious backgrounds {{are likely to}} come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance.

While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E

25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, geobiology {{is closely related}} to many other fields of study, and does not have clearly defined {{boundaries}} or perfect agreement on what exactly they comprise. Some practitioners take a very broad view of its boundaries, encompassing many older, more established fields such as biogeochemistry, paleontology, and microbial ecology. Others take a more narrow view, assigning it to <b>emerging</b> <b>research</b> that falls between these existing fields, such as with geomicrobiology. The following list includes both those that are clearly a part of geobiology, e.g. geomicrobiology, as well as those that share scientific interests but have not historically been considered a sub-discipline of geobiology, e.g. paleontology.|$|E

Information Systems (IS) researchers have argued for and against having a research framework in the IS field. Several descriptive and normative IS research frameworks have been suggested.

Within this debate different conceptions of IS <b>research</b> paradigms have <b>emerged.</b> <b>Research</b> of IS research frameworks and paradigms is historical in nature and aims to clarify IS as a research field...|$|R

30|$|In summary, our {{intent was}} to {{highlight}} exciting findings concerning the relationship between sialylation and cell fate decision during development, reprogramming and cancer progression. Since {{the discovery of the}} sialic acid 82 years ago, the roles of sialylation in the regulation of cell function are beginning to <b>emerge.</b> <b>Research</b> on the function of sialylation demonstrates that sialylated glycans are involved in multiple disciplines spanning immunology, neurobiology, ophthalmology, tumorigenicity, pluripotency, fertilization and development. It is increasingly apparent that the aberrant of sialylation lead to serious diseases, such as immune system abnormality, dry eyes, cancer, embryonic lethality and so on.|$|R
