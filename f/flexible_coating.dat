Methods: The nanosuspension was prepared by the solvent displacement evaporation method, using three different polymers (Eudragit® L 100 55, Kollicoat® MAE 100 P and PEG 4000) and Polysorbate 80. Dynamic Light Scattering was used for evaluating the particle size (PS), zeta potential, and conductivity of the nanosuspension. Loratadine release profiles were evaluated in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The shelf and accelerated stability were assessed during three months. Results: Nanosuspension particle size was 45. 94  ±  0. 50  nm, with a low polydispersion index (PdI, 0. 300). Kollicoat® MAE 100 P produced a hard and <b>flexible</b> <b>coating</b> layer.

40|$|A bio-molecular system {{passes through}} various {{metastable}} energy states {{until it reaches}} its lowest energy stable state. Probing these metastable states and finding {{their relationship with the}} delicate structures of bio-molecular pairs are crucial for understanding each step of a bio-molecular function. Even with such importance, however, metastable states are difficult to observe with current available techniques (e. g. conventional AFM techniques) because of a relatively short life time and their non-equilibrium nature in a solution phase. Here we designed and developed a cantilever based optical interfacial force microscope (COIFM), a new tool for studying the bio-molecular metastable energy states using the force feedback technique. In order to apply the COIFM to biological systems, we coated the COIFM sensor with a <b>flexible</b> <b>coating</b> material called “silicone elastomer” to isolate electrical signaling for force feedback from charged species in the aqueous environment. The force feedback responses collected such as the square wave response and bandwidth measurement showed that the performance of COIFM in liquid is nearly comparable to that of the COIFM taken in air, indicating that the effect of the elastormer coating on feedback performance was negligible. Force-distance measurements, collected in a conducting PBS liquid, demonstrated its enhanced lateral resolution and force resolution over the conventional IFM by at least an order of magnitude (less than 10 pN). The enhancement agrees with our expectation due to the decreased probe size and due to the sensitive optical detection scheme. This enhanced performance along with COIFM’s excellent distance and force control capability will allow for the investigation of the metastable states along the reaction coordinates...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{conductive}} adhesives (ECAs) containing silver filler and polyaniline co-filler {{were characterized}} for their electro-mechanical properties. Polyaniline is a conductive polymer {{and has a}} moderate conductivity in between those of the silver and epoxy. Incorporation of polyaniline (μm sized) in silver-epoxy facilitated the electrical conduction in ECAs and reduced the percolation threshold- a minimum volume of filler necessary to initiate the conduction. It also prevented the localization of charge carriers due to aggregation of silver filler particles. ‘Bridging effect’ was observed due to addition polyaniline in which the polyaniline enhanced the tunneling of electrons over the silver filler particles. We have investigated the polyaniline co-fillers as a promising alternative way to tune the mechanical and electrical properties of the ECAs and have provided {{a detailed analysis of}} the electro-mechanical properties of silver-epoxy (Ag-epoxy) and silver-polyaniline-epoxy (Ag-PANI-epoxy) system in both partially-cured/ viscoelastic and fully-cured states. Analysis of electro-mechanical properties of silver-epoxy and silver-polyaniline-epoxy also provided the insights into electrical contact resistance of ECAs under compressive force. Electro-mechanical properties of ECAs were measured ‘in-situ’ using micro-indentation technique. We also synthesized the electrically conductive and highly crystalline nanotubes of polyaniline by mini-emulsion polymerization of aniline. The motivation behind the synthesis of polyaniline was to propose a potential filler/co-filler for replacement of metallic filler in ECAs. Electrical conductivity of polyaniline nanotubes was tuned by in-situ doping using hydrochloric acid as a dopant. Increase in dopant caused the polyaniline crystallite to grow along (400) plane.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{progress}} of the NanoCleaR project, which began in Januaray of 2012. With funding awarded by the EU's Seventh Framework programme, this project seeks to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for nano-scale thin films on large area substrates. The outcomes of NanoCleaR will benefit the many areas of active research involved in the manufacture of devices on large area plastic films. For example; flexible photovoltaics, lighting and display devices. These flexible devices are fabricated on polymer film by the repeated deposition, and patterning, of thin layer materials using roll-to-roll processes. The surface of the starting polymer film must be of very high quality in order to avoid creating defects in the device layers. Since these defects reduce manufacturing yield, in order to prevent them, a thin, <b>flexible</b> <b>coating</b> is generally applied to the polymer film prior to structuring. NanoCleaR is studying the ultra-thin aluminium oxide layers on the polymer film, which are designed as barrier layers for structured flexible photovoltaic modules. Barrier films are required to prevent the ingress of water vapour and oxygen from degrading the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Highly conformal aluminium oxide barrier layers have been produced by atomic layer deposition on plastic films with smooth surface coatings. This paper begins by reporting the results of early stage measurements conducted to characterise the uncoated and coated polymer film surface topography using feature analysis. This paper will then describe how surface irregularities on the film can create defects within the nanometre-scale, aluminium oxide, barrier layer. The need for improved, high speed, surface inspection for the quality control of large area flexible electronics manufacturing, is then discussed and illustrated for several stages of the manufacture of surface structured flexible electronics.

40|$|Leveraging the {{durability}} of photovoltaic (PV) plants at an acceptable cost is {{becoming one of the}} most challenging issue to foster the diffusion of PV. For instance, stringent requirements for the modules life time of at least 30 years are carried out by the US Department of Energy. One of the most important technological factor to enhance the PV modules durability is represented by the availability of suitable coating materials with high barrier properties, flexibility, and affordable cost. These properties are of a special concern for thin film PV cells, which are more sensitive against the degradation effect due to atmospheric agents. A lot of research effort has been devoted to study and to develop novel flexible and low cost coating materials with improved barrier properties against water vapour and oxygen. However, few studies have been carried out to leverage the barrier properties against liquid atmospheric agents of the coating materials for PV cells (e. g., acid and basic rains). As a result, these studies proposed the development of transparent hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces suitable for solar cells applications by means of multi-step processes involving plasma treatment steps of the polymer surfaces as well as high temperature steps (> 150 °C). Nevertheless, these multi-step processes are likely to turn out to be expensive and difficult to be implemented at industrial level. This work aims at studying and developing highly hydrophobic transparent and <b>flexible</b> <b>coating</b> materials for solar cells by means of a simple, but yet effective, single-step process, which is carried out at room temperature and specifically applied to PV standard coating materials. The current barrier protective films for the PV applications are generally composed of one ore more layers of polymer substrate with an inorganic coating. The inorganic coating is generally consisting of SiOx or AlOx, whereas the polymer substrate can be EVA, ETFE, PET or PEN.
