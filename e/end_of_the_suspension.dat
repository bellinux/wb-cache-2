50|$|Under most {{conditions}} {{the car is}} very responsive and forgiving, but it has some handling issues. The chassis, which is shared by the TR2, TR3, TR3A and TR4 has limited wheel travel. As a result, on very hard cornering, the inside rear wheel can lift, causing sudden over-steer due to the increased load on the outside rear tyre. This is particularly true with radial tyres; the original TR2/3/3A suspension was built with older, crossply tyre designs in mind. The wheel lifting is more sudden than that of other cars, because it is caused by coming to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> travel while there is still load on the tyre, so the load on the other (outside) rear wheel is a discontinuous function of cornering load, rather than just changing slope.|$|E

5000|$|In many racing cars, {{the springs}} and dampers are {{relocated}} inside the bodywork. The suspension uses a bellcrank {{to transfer the}} forces at the knuckle <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> to the internal spring and damper. This is then known as a [...] "push rod" [...] if bump travel [...] "pushes" [...] on the rod (and subsequently the rod must be joined {{to the bottom of}} the upright and angled upward). As the wheel rises, the push rod compresses the internal spring via a pivot or pivoting system. The opposite arrangement, a [...] "pull rod", will pull on the rod during bump travel, and the rod must be attached to the top of the upright, angled downward. Locating the spring and damper inboard increases the total mass of the suspension, but reduces the unsprung mass, and also allows the designer to make the suspension more aerodynamic.|$|E
5000|$|Yet another {{variation}} of short link design is the [...] "Switch link", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle.

The lower link would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or [...] "Switching" [...] the lower link's direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the lower link has been replaced with a liner bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox.

5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight spring strip which suspends the pendulum. [...] The upper <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> spring is not attached to a fixed support as in most clocks, but instead {{is attached to a}} heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned knife-edges on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The bending point of the suspension spring is in alignment with the line of contact of the knife-edges. When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its knife edges by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the suspension spring is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|E

40|$|Enzymatic {{browning}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} obstacles encountered in the establishment of suspension systems of licorice cells. Browning of cells may result in decreased viability, poor growth and even death. The present study investigated the mechanism of browning reactions and the effective controlling methods. The results showed that the cell viability and membrane permeabilization obviously changed when the cells were transferred to liquid medium. The transformation caused rapid increase in the levels of polyphenol oxidase activity and in the production of polyphenols. Osmotic and hydrodynamic stresses arising from liquid culture were regarded as the major causes of enzymatic browning. Ascorbic acid and L-cysteine were found to be the most significant anti-browning agents that could decrease the degree of browning with 55. 8 % and 52. 2 %, respectively, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> culture's lag phase.

The cultivar Rubi MG- 1192 was used, planted in January 2001 in a randomized block experimental design in split-plots with three replications. Treatments consisted of three water regimes: (i) irrigation when soil water tension reached values around 20 kPa and suspension of irrigation during July and August; (ii) irrigation when soil water tension reached values around 60 kPa and suspension of irrigation during July and August and (iii) a non-irrigated control. Four planting densities were used: (i) 2500 (4. 0 x 1. 0 m), (ii) 3333 (3. 0 x 1. 0 m), (iii) 5000 (2. 0 x 1. 0 m) and (iv) 10000 plants ha- 1 (2. 0 x 0. 5 m).

40|$|Introduction A {{repository}} of high-level nuclear wastes in the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) clay rock {{will lead to}} a temporary increase in temperature locally around the disposal cells, up to about 80 Â°C. Thermally induced modifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pore-water chemistry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clay rock must be assessed since the pore water chemistry can affect <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> corrosion of metallic materials used in the disposal facility (Gaucher et al., 2009; Altmann, 2008). <b>The</b> chemistry <b>of</b> COx pore water has been studied at ambient temperature (~ 25 Â°C) using modelling approaches constrained by parameter values measured on core samples (Gaucher et al., 2006, 2009) and by measurements of pore water collected by means of specially designed in-situ experiments (Vinsot et al., 2008). In particular, the predictive model from Gaucher et al. (2009) reproduces the measured, in situ pore-water composition without any estimated parameters. In the present study, carried out as part of a collaborative BRGM/Andra research program, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> long-term batch experiments performed at 80 Â°C, are compared with compositions predicted using a model based on the one developed for 25 Â°C. Batch experiments Two batch experiments have been performed with COx rock samples in contact with synthetic water, for respectively 6 and 20 months. The experiments were prepared at 25 Â°C under anoxic atmosphere in closed reactors, with solution compositions close to the pore water composition. Afterwards, each system was heated at 80 Â°C. During <b>the</b> experiments, measurements <b>of</b> PCO 2 were carried out as this parameter is considered as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactivity <b>of</b> this carbonate-dominated system. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments, <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> was filtered at 0. 1 Âµm at 80 Â°C, under anoxic atmosphere. The pH was also measured at 80 Â°C. Major cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Sr) and anions (notably Cl, SO 4), TIC and minor and trace elements (notably Si, Al, Fe, Zn, Pb) were analysed. Concerning the solids, some minor changes were detected in the mineralogy between initial and final solids, essentially partial dissolution of celestite and a small increase in <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> dolomite. Besides, an interesting change was observed by TEM with <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> needles of nanocrystalline goethite on pyrite particles for the solid from the 20 months experiment (see figure). Such needles were not observed on the initial solid, although magnetic measurements at low temperature on the sample revealed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> nanocrystalline goethite. Moreover, an increasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio in <b>the</b> octahedral environment <b>of</b> clay minerals, compared with initial ratio, was evidenced by 57 Fe MÃ¶ssbauer spectrometry. Modelling <b>of</b> batch experiments <b>The</b> predictive model <b>of</b> composition as a function of temperature was developed, based on the Gaucher et al. (2009) model and using the PHREEQC code and Thermoddem database (Blanc et al., submitted). As a first approximation, the model considers a primary mineral assemblage with quartz, pyrite, carbonates (calcite, dolomite and siderite), sulfates (celestite), aluminosilicates (chlorite and illite). Moreover, the model takes into account exchange reactions and dissolution reaction kinetics for the potentially more reactive minerals. For both cases, at 6 and 20 months, the comparison between estimated and observed concentrations of ions in solution are in rather good agreement for pH, Si, Al, major cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Sr) and for sulphates and chlorides. <b>The</b> calculated concentrations <b>of</b> Fe are, on the other hand, too high compared with the measured concentrations, for both experiments. The control on the Fe(II) solubility by siderite was already questioned in Gaucher et al. (2009). This problem is being studied, notably by considering <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> nanogoethite detected in the initial sample and in the solid after 20 months experiment.
