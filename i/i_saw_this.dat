25|$|Charles Hennebois {{touches on}} a {{wrenching}} aspect concerning the wounded. Some of them, {{instead of being}} transported to the hospital, were finished off {{on the field of}} battle: “Men wounded the day before were calling them from afar and asking to drink. The Germans finished them off by butting them with their rifles or bayoneting them, then despoiling them. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> from several metres away. A group of seven or eight men, felled by machine-gun crossfire, found itself at that point. Several were still alive, as they were begging the soldiers. They were finished off like I just said, shaken down and heaped up in a pile”. This claim is refuted in a German propaganda book about what happened in the camps published in 1918.|$|E
500|$|That afternoon, Cole {{attended}} the rally, wearing {{her dress and}} holding her sign. The Nixon train pulled in, and the police lowered the rope which kept the crowd clear of the tracks. In interviews, Cole related that as the crowd surged forward, she dropped her sign amidst the pushing and shoving. Cole stated, [...] "I wanted a sign to wave. I had lost my own placard and as the crowd moved forward as the train approached <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> sign lying {{in the street and}} I just picked it up and held it high, hoping Mr. Nixon would see it." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{still part}} of WCW, Konnan was {{contacted}} by talent scout Pat Patterson on New Year's Eve 1990, {{which led to a}} meeting with Vince McMahon, where the initial idea for what became Max Moon was discussed. According to Konnan, [...] "When I was wrestling in Japan, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> Japanese anime cartoon robot on TV that shot confetti and fire. [...] asked if I knew anybody that could design it." [...] Konnan was given an outfit (purchased by the WWF at the cost of $13,000) bedecked with circuitry and a pyrotechnic gun that shot sparkles into the crowd. Konnan recollected later that the costs associated with the costume led to problems between himself and the promotion right from the start.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this,</b> wretched {{though it}} made me, and bitter {{the sense of}} {{dependence}} and even of degradation that it awakened,--I <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, {{and that she was}} not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this,</b> a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> that <b>I,</b> too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this,</b> the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun.|$|R

500|$|Goya {{completed}} 56 plates {{during the}} war against France, and these are often viewed as eye-witness accounts. A final batch—including plate 1, several {{in the middle of}} the series, and the last 17 plates—are likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> (...) and One can not look (...) [...] While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups. A number of other scenes are known to have been related to him second hand. It is known that he used a sketchbook when visiting battle sites; at his studio, he set to work on copper plate once he had absorbed and assimilated meaning from his sketches. All drawings are from the same paper, and all the copper plates are uniform.|$|E
500|$|Goya's {{series of}} {{aquatint}} etchings The Disasters of War (...) was not completed until 1820, {{although most of}} the prints were made in the period 18101814. [...] The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the British Museum, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this,</b> which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa. [...] (One cannot look at this) is clearly related compositionally and thematically; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{made her}} directorial debut {{on the video}} for [...] "Ego" [...] with the {{choreographer}} Frank Gatson Jr, {{who had been working}} with her for twelve years by then, as the creative director. Gatson has been the creative director for many of her videos, such as [...] "Suga Mama", [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and [...] "Get Me Bodied", as well as her last three world tours, including the I Am... World Tour (2009-2010). Beyoncé let Gatson direct the video for [...] "Ego" [...] after he introduced her to a new choreographer, Sheryl Murakami. Beyoncé told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "My goal for [...] video is simplicity... In 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)', <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> old tape of Bob Fosse's wife , and I used that as inspiration. I thought in this world, with all the technology and everything that's going on, to strip everything down—great idea. So I kind of did the same thing, but glossy and black, for 'Ego'." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this,</b> this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened {{and you can see that}} at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E
500|$|The first fossil {{specimen}} of the dinosaur later named Sinosauropteryx prima was uncovered in August 1996 by Li Yumin. Yumin was a farmer and part-time fossil hunter who often prospected around Liaoning Province to acquire fossils {{to sell to}} individuals and museums. Yumin recognized the unique quality of the specimen, which was separated into two slabs, and sold the slabs to two separate museums in China: the National Geological Museum in Beijing, and the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology. The director of the Beijing museum, Ji Qiang, {{recognized the importance of}} the find, as did visiting Canadian palaeontologist Phil Currie and artist Michael Skrepnick, who became aware of the fossil by chance as they explored the Beijing museum's collections after leading a fossil tour of the area {{during the first week of}} October, 1996. Currie recognized the significance of the fossil immediately. As The New York Times quoted him, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> slab of silt stone mixed with volcanic ash in which the creature is embedded, I was bowled over." [...] When originally described, the authors named Sinosauropteryx, meaning [...] "Chinese Reptilian Wing.|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} acting and singing auditions, Hal Prince offered the still {{relatively}} unknown Paige {{the title role}} of Eva Perón {{in the first stage}} production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Evita. Her performance won her critical acclaim and brought her into public prominence at the age of 30. Julie Covington, who played the role on the original concept album, had turned down the opportunity of playing the role on stage leading to a long search for a new star. Paige eventually competed against Bonnie Schoen, an American initially favoured by Prince for the role. She later said, [...] "Bonnie was already a big name on Broadway. In a way, she didn't have anything to prove. She was smoothly, silkily professional. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as my big chance and, like Eva when she clapped eyes on Peron, I grabbed with both hands. I wanted the role more than anything else in the whole world." [...] For her performance in Evita, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical, which at that time was called the Society of West End Theatre Award. She also won the Variety Club Award for Showbusiness Personality of the Year. She played the role for 20 months in total, from 1978 to 1980. She also released her first studio album in 1978, titled Sitting Pretty. Just prior to her success in Evita, Paige had strongly considered becoming a nursery nurse, but after she sang for Dustin Hoffman, he made her promise that she would continue in theatre work. She admitted that she was [...] "fed up with the whole thing" [...] and that she could not even afford new clothing or to eat out; [...] "Evita saved me" [...] she stated.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E

When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> one he did in 1957, it screamed 'Valleys of Neptune' to me so we knew we'd use it for this project," [...] said his step-sister, Janie. The album artwork is a mix of his painting and a Linda McCartney photograph of him with a blue tint.|$|E

2500|$|For the 2009 budget, the City faced a $35 {{million budget}} {{shortfall}}. [...] Proposals {{to combat the}} shortfall included a 4.9% tax increase and cuts {{to as many as}} 230 jobs, 700 daycare spaces, $4 million in arts program, and transit service. Following budget discussions, the budget was passed on December 9 on an omnibus motion from councillor Rick Chiarelli. The budget resulted in a 4.9% tax increase and the deferral of some spending items, without the proposed arts and transit cuts. O'Brien had criticized the budget, calling it a [...] "travesty" [...] and saying, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> afternoon was simply disgusting.

2500|$|The idea of {{the cover}} was Siouxsie's.

I {{wanted to be able to}} completely control the lighting, and so an indoor pool was the only option. I scouted quite a few pools, but when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. I wanted to give it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. We used a number of 1000K and 2000K lights around the pool edge. I used school kids as models and they pretty well ran riot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many written {{reports and}} testimonies {{collected}} by the Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo tribunal, and investigated by prosecutor William Webb (the future Judge-in-Chief), indicate that Japanese personnel {{in many parts of}} Asia and the Pacific committed acts of cannibalism against Allied prisoners of war. In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: [...] "cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers". This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an Indian POW, Havildar Changdi Ram, testified that: [...] " [...] the Kempeitai beheaded [...] pilot. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters...
