5|$|Cameroon's {{population}} is almost evenly divided between {{urban and rural}} dwellers. Population density <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain. Douala, Yaoundé, and Garoua are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, {{and most of the}} South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to anticancer chemotherapy, in {{particular}} alkylating agents, {{can increase the}} risk of subsequently developing AML. The risk <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> about three to five years after chemotherapy. Other chemotherapy agents, specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemias, which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge <b>is</b> <b>highest.</b> On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone <b>is</b> <b>highest,</b> the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost <b>is</b> <b>highest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Second, the longitudes of {{ascending}} nodes {{of the two}} bodies—the points {{where they}} cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> above Neptune's orbit.

5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
5|$|The windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with {{distance}} {{in relation to}} surface level pressure, with the lowest pressure being found near the center, and the highest winds typically just on the cold/poleward side of warm fronts, occlusions, and cold fronts, where the pressure gradient force <b>is</b> <b>highest.</b> The area poleward and west of the cold and warm fronts connected to extratropical cyclones {{is known as the}} cold sector, while the area equatorward and east of its associated cold and warm fronts is known as the warm sector.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E
