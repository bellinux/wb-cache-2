50|$|For {{applications}} in a static flow, the fluid velocity {{comes from the}} acoustic streaming. The magnitude of acoustic streaming depends on the power and frequency of input. Also, the properties of <b>fluid</b> <b>media</b> affect the value as well. For typical acoustic-based microdevices, the operating frequency ranges from ~kHz to ~MHz. The vibration amplitude is in range of 0.1 nm~1 µm. The fluid used is water. The estimated magnitude of acoustic streaming is in range of 1 µm/s~ 1 mm/s. Thus, the acoustic streaming should be smaller than the main flow for most continuous flow applications. The drag force is mainly induced by the main flow in those applications.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{species of}} fish and birds are able to locomote in both air and water, two <b>fluid</b> <b>media</b> with very {{different}} properties. A fluid is a particular phase of matter that deforms under shear stresses and includes any type of liquid or gas. Because fluids are easily deformable and move in response to applied forces, efficiently locomoting in a fluid medium presents unique challenges. Specific morphological characteristics are therefore required in animal species that primarily depend on fluidic locomotion. Because the properties of air and water are so different, swimming and flying have very disparate morphological requirements. As a result, despite the large diversity of animals {{that are capable of}} flight or swimming, {{only a limited number of}} these species have mastered the ability to both fly and swim. These species demonstrate distinct morphological and behavioral tradeoffs associated with transitioning from air to water and water to air.|$|E

Nevertheless, the current easy access to news and information from around the globe, makes it difficult to guarantee PSYOP programs do not reach the US public. Or, in the words of Army Col. James A. Treadwell, who commanded the U.S. military psyops unit in Iraq in 2003, in The Washington Post:There's {{always going to be a}} certain amount of bleed-over with the global information environment.Agence France Presse reported on U.S. propaganda campaigns that:The Pentagon acknowledged in a newly declassified document that the US public is increasingly exposed to propaganda disseminated overseas in psychological operations.Former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved the document referred to, which is titled [...] "Information Operations Roadmap." [...] The document acknowledges restrictions on targeting domestic audience, but fails to offer any way of limiting the effect PSYOP programs have on domestic audiences. A recent book by Emma L.
