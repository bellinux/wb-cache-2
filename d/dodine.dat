50|$|Cyclaneusma {{presents}} {{somewhat of}} a challenge to manage, as infected needles remain part of the tree throughout the winter and spring months. The creation of spores as well as infection can occur in freezing temperatures with wet needles. Inoculated needles may not develop symptoms {{for up to a}} year from the infection date, proving difficult for the effectiveness of pesticides applied in the first season to be judged. Infected needles on or under the tree retain the ability to release spores any time during the growing season, so they should be removed as soon as possible. It is typically recommended to apply five treatments of fungicide, such as chlorothalonil or <b>dodine,</b> when the threshold level is met, beginning in March and continuing roughly every 5-6 weeks through October.

40|$|The {{fungicide}} <b>dodine</b> {{has been}} widely used in selective media to isolate entomopatho- genic fungi (EF) from contaminating microorganisms, primarily bacteria and non- entomopathogenic fungi. In order to isolate the fungus Metarhizium acridum from soil for grasshopper and Mormon cricket control in the western USA, the susceptibility of M. acridum was compared with two Metarhizium spp. and other EF species. The isolates were inoculated onto mycological media with concentrations of <b>dodine</b> ranging from 0. 0001 to 0. 03 % active ingredient (A. I.). In addition, susceptibilities of five Metarhizium spp. isolates to two sources of <b>dodine,</b> Syllit† commercial fungicide (65 % A. I.) and Sigma† reagent grade (99 % A. I.), were compared using Czapek agar medium. Responses to the two <b>dodine</b> sources were virtually identical. Accordingly, subsequent experiments used the less expensive Syllit <b>dodine.</b> Three media [Czapek, potato dextrose agar plus yeast extract (PDAY) and oatmeal agar] were evaluated for appropriateness as the base in selective media. Germination of {{all three of the}} M. acridum isolates tested was almost completely inhibited by <b>dodine</b> concentrations of 0. 002 % A. I. in Czapek or 0. 006 % A. I. in PDAY. On the other hand, M. robertsii and M. anisopliae isolates were considerably more tolerant, with germination not being inhibited until 0. 010 % A. I. in Czapek or 0. 030 % A. I. in PDAY. The higher vulnerability of the isolates to low concentrations of <b>dodine</b> in Czapek medium suggests that this medium would be less effective than PDAY in a selective medium. Oatmeal agar greatly improved fungal growth, but the levels of inhibition were lower. Therefore, PDAY was selected as the best selective basal medium. The lowest concentration that inhibited a common soil-inhabiting fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, was 0. 001 % A.

The applicant also submitted additional residue trials on apples and a new freezer storage stability study in high oil content matrices to confirm the MRLs derived for pome fruit and olives in the previously issued EFSA reasoned opinion. The lowering of the MRL for apricots is justified as for the existing MRL acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded. According to EFSA, the submitted data are sufficient to confirm the MRL proposal of 0. 9 mg/kg for pome fruits as derived in the previous EFSA reasoned opinion. The MRL proposal of 0. 09 mg/kg for apricots has been derived, in {{accordance with}} the provisions of the EU guidance document on extrapolation from residue trials on peaches and apples. Although the data are compliant with the data requirements, EFSA recommends performing additional trials on apricots to confirm that the MRL is sufficient to cover the use on apricots.

40|$|Apples are a {{high value}} commodity, and thus proper {{management}} of pests is required to produce high quality, marketable fresh fruit. The most economically important disease of apples is apple scab. Venturia inaequalis, the causal agent of apple scab, infects both commercial apples and ornamental crabapples and is primarily controlled by fungicides. Long-term and extensive fungicide use has led to decreased sensitivity of V. inaequalis to multiple fungicide modes of action.

Although these media are effective for isolating many species of Metarhizium and Beauveria from soil, they are inefficient media for isolation of an important Metarhizium species, Metarhizium acridum, from non-sterile soil. Our current study was directed to formulating a dodine-free selective medium that is efficient for isolating naturally occurring Beauveria spp. and Metarhizium spp., especially M. acridum, from soil. The selective medium (designated CTC medium) consists of potato dextrose agar plus yeast extract (PDAY) supplemented with chloramphenicol, thiabendazole and cycloheximide. In comparisons with selective media previously reported in the literature, the CTC medium afforded colonies that were larger and had both earlier and more abundant conidiation of entomopathogenic fungi, features which greatly facilitated identification of the emerging entomopathogenic fungi.

Isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana from citrus orchards in the Eastern Cape, South Africa were maintained on Sabouraud Dextrose 4 % Agar supplemented with <b>Dodine,</b> chloramphenicol and rifampicin at 25 °C. Infectivity of the fungal isolates was initially assessed using 5 th instar false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta, larvae. Mealybug bioassays were performed in 24 well plates using 1 x 107 ml- 1 conidial suspensions and kept at 26 °C for 5 days with a photoperiod of 12 L: 12 D. A Beauveria commercial product and an un-inoculated control were also screened for comparison. Isolates GAR 17 B 3 (B. bassiana) and FCM AR 23 B 3 (M. anisopliae) both resulted in 67. 5 % mealybug crawler mortality and GB AR 23 13 3 (B. bassiana) resulted in 64 % crawler mortality. These 3 isolates were further tested in dose-dependent assays. Probit analyses were conducted on the dose-dependent assays data using PROBAN to determine LC₅₀ values. For both the mealybug adult and crawlers FCM AR 23 B 3 required the lowest concentration to achieve LC₅₀ at 4. 96 x 10 ⁶ conidia ml- 1 and 5. 29 x 10 ⁵ conidia ml- 1, respectively. Bioassays on adult thrips were conducted in munger cells with leaf buds inoculated with the conidial suspensions. Isolate GAR 17 B 3 had the highest mortality rate at 70 % on thrips while FCM AR 23 B 3 resulted in 60 % mortality. Identification of the isolates, FCM AR 23 B 3, GAR 17 B 3 and GB AR 23 13 3, were confirmed to be correct using both microscopic and molecularly techniques.

Pesticides were then classified into four categories, according to the reduction in parasitization (IOBC/WPRS) : 1, harmless (99 %). The fungicides (g of the active ingredient/ 100 L of water) calcium + copper (40 + 100), <b>dodine</b> (79), folpet (125), iprodion (75), mancozeb (160), mancozeb + copper oxichloride (88 + 60) and triforine (24) and the insecticide teflubenzuron (3. 75) were considered harmless (class 1); the fungicide tebuconazol (20) and the mineral oil (800) were slightly harmful (class 2); the fungicide-acaricide sulphur (480) and the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium (200) were moderately harmful (class 3); the insecticides fenitrothion (75), malathion (200), phosmet (100) and spinosad (6) were harmful (class 4) to T. pretiosum...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{growing concern}} about {{the harmful effects of}} {{pesticides}} on humans and non-target organisms has resulted in an increasing demand from international markets for fruit that is produced using sustainable management systems. This study measured the effects of fungicides on population density and species richness of phylloplane microorganisms in apple orchards under different management systems. A secondary objective was to identify one or a few microorganisms that could be easily recognised by colony morphology and be used as bioindicators of sustainable orchard management. During the 1998 / 1999 season, a sampling, isolation and enumeration method was developed that determined the amount of natural variation in microorganism populations among trees, among locations within trees and between spring and autumn, in an unsprayed orchard. The results showed that during spring, the variation among trees, locations within trees, and dilution plates were responsible for 49, 39 and 12 percent, respectively, of the total variation. During autumn, the variation among trees, locations within trees, shoots, and dilution plates were responsible for 34, 0, 49 and 17 percent, respectively of the total variation. The information gained from the first study was used to modify the methods, which were used in a second study in 1999 / 2000, to compare microorganism populations from apple orchards under different management systems, at four times during the season. Three orchards followed ENZA-IFP (Integrated Fruit Production) requirements for export, three produced for the local market (IFP-local market) and two produced apples organically, complying with BIO-GRO standards. An unsprayed orchard was also included in the study. The results showed that populations increased during the season, by factors of 11, 47, 774 and 80 for bacteria, 'smooth yeasts', Aureobasidium spp. and filamentous fungi, respectively. Throughout the season, population densities of bacteria and 'smooth yeasts' were similar in all orchards (1 x 10 ⁵ to 1 X 10 ⁶ colony forming units per leaf [CFU/leaf]), whereas those of Aureobasidium spp. and filamentous fungi were lower in IFP orchards (about 1 x 10 ³ and 1 x 10 ⁴ CFU/leaf respectively) than in BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards (3 x 10 ⁴ and 1 x 10 ⁵ CFU/leaf respectively). The mean species richness (number of recognisable taxonomic units per sample [RTU/sample]) varied from 5. 3 in IFP orchards to 6. 6 in the BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards, but species richness was lower in IFP orchards (5) than in BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards (13) during spring, and it increased during the season and became similar to that of BIO-GRO orchards in autumn. In a third study, the direct effects were determined of the fungicides, captan, copper hydroxide, myclobutanil, <b>dodine,</b> inorganic sulphur and a fish-based foliar fertiliser, on phylloplane microorganism populations. Products were sprayed four times during the 1999 / 2000 season, and the microorganism populations assessed immediately before treatment and at 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment. With all microorganisms combined there were significant differences (P≤ 0. 05) in the level of increase or decrease in microorganism populations among the four treatment dates, but differences among products were only significant at P≤ 0. l. 'Smooth yeasts', filamentous fungi and species richness, showed significant (P≤ 0. 05) changes in population densities due to foliar treatments. Although this trend was observed only in a few (3 / 60) cases, this indicates that a single isolated foliar application of a chemical product can affect microbial population densities and species richness. The effect of repetitive fungicide applications, different products and product combinations and insecticide use on non-target microorganism as applied in commercial situations requires further investigation. During the second and third study, Cladosporium spp. were identified as having potential to be suitable indicators of sustainable orchard management, because they were present in most orchards, during most of the growing season, and most often showed a significant response to orchard management systems and fungicide treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to improve the understanding of the environmental factors affecting development of olive leaf spot (OLS) in New Zealand olive groves and to develop strategies for the disease management. The effects of temperature, relative humidity (RR), leaf wetness and leaf age on conidium germination were investigated for Spilocaea oieagina, the causal organism of olive leaf spot. Detached leaves of five leaf ages (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after emergence), six different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C), eight wetness periods (0, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h), and three RR levels (60, 80 and 100 %) were tested. Results showed that percentage germination decreased linearly in proportion to leaf age (P< 0. 00 1). Temperature significantly (P< 0. 001) affected conidium germination, with the effective range being 5 to 25 °C and the optimum being 20 °C. The rate of germ tube elongation followed a similar trend, with the optimum being 15 °C. Formation of appressoria, when found, occurred 6 h after the first signs of germination and their frequency followed the same temperature trends with a maximum of 43 % at 15 °C and none formed at 25 °C. The minimum leaf wetness periods for germination at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C were 24, 12, 9, 9, and 12 h, respectively. Studies on the prepenetration and infection processes on olive leaves by S. oieagina, using scanning electron microscopy, showed that the penetration pegs allowed direct penetration of the cuticle, but could not penetrate the host through the trichomes. A study of the effects of temperature, leaf age, conidial concentration, continuous and interrupted leaf wetness periods and relative humidity (RR) during the dry periods on whole plants showed that OLS severity decreased (P< 0. 001) with increasing leaf age at the time of inoculation. The severity of OLS also increased as inoculum concentration increased from 1. 0 X 102 to 2. 5 X 105 conidia per mL at all five temperatures (5 - 25 °C), with most lesions formed at 15 °C and least at 25 °C. The minimum leaf wetness periods for infection at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C were 18, 12, 12, 12, and 24 h, respectively. Infection frequencies during wet periods interrupted with dry periods of 70 and 100 % RH depended on the RH and length of the dry period and the length of the initial wet period, with the lowest OLS severity after 12 h wetness and 12 h at 70 % RH. Sporulation on olive leaf spot lesions followed similar trends over the same temperatures and moisture conditions, with maximum sporulation at 15 °C and 100 % RH but none at 25 °C and 70 % RH. Lesion expansion was affected (P< 0. 001) by the same conditions, with 15 °C and continuous wetness being optimum and very little expansion occurring at 25 °C. Sequence analysis of rDNA (lTSl- 5. 8 S-ITS 2), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and universally primed-polymerase chain reaction (UP-PCR) techniques were used to study the genetic structure of S. oleagina populations using 98 isolates from New Zealand olive groves along with one isolate each from Australia and Italy. Alignment of the cloned sequences of four New Zealand isolates with the isolates from Australia and Italy showed great similarity with similarity indices for ITS 1, ITS 2 and 5. 8 S coding regions of the isolates being 96 - 100, 99. 8 - 100 and 99 - 100 %, respectively. RFLP analysis revealed no differences between the New Zealand isolates but UP-PCR found low levels of gene and genotypic diversity in all populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed small but significant (P = 0. 001) variations among regions, and most of the molecular variability (87 %) was found within populations. Greenhouse studies of the fungicides, boscalid, captan, carbendazim, copper hydroxide, copper sulphate, difenoconazole, <b>dodine,</b> kresoxim-methyl, and a kresoxim-methyllcopper hydroxide mixture, showed that all significantly (P< 0. 001) reduced OLS severity, with highest efficacy when applied up to 3 days pre- and 3 days post-inoculation. In field trials, most of the fungicides reduced disease incidence when applied twice in spring and autumn. Of the fungicides tested, copper sulphate and a mixture of kresoxim-methyl/copper hydroxide were the most effective, reducing disease severity by 85 to 96 % and 63 to 93 %, respectively. This research has provided three models relating climatic parameters to OLS development that focus on conidium germination, infection and sporulation models which should be field-tested with the more promising fungicides. They could then be incorporated into a disease forecasting system, which may be used in conjunction with a spray schedule that could improve disease control for New Zealand growers by optimising the number and timing of fungicide applications...|$|E
