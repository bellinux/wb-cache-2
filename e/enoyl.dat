50|$|The monofunctional {{mitochondrial}} and peroxisomal enzymes {{are found}} in the mitochondria and peroxisomes of eukaryotes, respectively. The multifunctional enzymes {{are found in}} bacteria and in the peroxisomes of some eukaryotes, but they serve two functions: the N-terminal domain works the same as the other classes of enoyl-CoA isomerases and the C-terminal domain works as a dehydrogenase, specifically, to 3-hydroxyactyl-CoA. There are two divisions among the mitochondrial <b>enoyl</b> Co-A isomerase: short-chain and long-chain 4. In an immunoblot, antibodies were run against all <b>enoyl</b> CoA isomerase. However, two of these isomerases had antibody attachment: the short chain isomerase and the peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme. There was one enzyme which did not have binding specificity to this antibody: mitochondrial long-chain isomerase. Long-chain isomerase was found when it eluted at a lower potassium phosphate concentration in the gradient. Thus, the discovery of three sub-classes of <b>enoyl</b> CoA isomerase was made.|$|E

Linoleic acid is first attached to CoA through some acyl-CoA synthetase homologue synthesized by lipstatin biosynthetic operons (Lst) and goes through two β-oxidaition to hydroxytetradeca-5,8-dienyl-CoA. 3’ hydroxyl group from solution H2O is added by <b>enoyl</b> reductase homologue followed by <b>enoyl</b> hydratase homologue. Octanoic acid is also attached to CoA through similar acyl-CoA synthetase homologue (LstC) to form octanoyl-CoA. Octanoyl-CoA is 2’ carboxylated and loaded to acyl carrier protein (ACP) borrowed from primary metabolism to form hexyl-malonyl-ACP.|$|E
5000|$|Whatever the {{conformation}} of the hydrocarbon chain, β-oxidation occurs normally {{until the}} acyl CoA (because {{of the presence}} of a double bond) is not an appropriate substrate for acyl CoA dehydrogenase, or <b>enoyl</b> CoA hydratase: ...|$|E

50|$|Mammalian FAS {{consists}} of a homodimer of two identical protein subunits, in which three catalytic domains in the N-terminal section (-ketoacyl synthase (KS), malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT), and dehydrase (DH)), are separated by a core region of 600 residues from four C-terminal domains (<b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER), -ketoacyl reductase (KR), acyl carrier protein (ACP) and thioesterase (TE)).|$|E
5000|$|If the acyl CoA {{contains}} a cis-Δ4 double bond, then its dehydrogenation yields a 2,4-dienoyl intermediate, {{which is not}} a substrate for <b>enoyl</b> CoA hydratase. However, the enzyme 2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase reduces the intermediate, using NADPH, into trans-Δ3-enoyl CoA. As in the above case, this compound is converted into a suitable intermediate by 3,2-Enoyl CoA isomerase.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 2-enoyl-CoA reductase, dehydrogenase, acyl coenzyme A (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, phosphate), <b>enoyl</b> coenzyme A reductase, crotonyl coenzyme A reductase, crotonyl-CoA reductase, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (NADP+).|$|E

50|$|The β-hydroxyacyl-ACP is then {{transferred}} {{back to the}} β subunit, where it is dehydrated in dehydratase (DH) domain. Another reduction reaction then performed in the <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER) domain of the β subunit to form a saturated acyl-ACP chain.

50|$|It is {{proposed}} that MmpB to catalyzes {{the synthesis of}} 9-HN (Figure 5). MmpB contains a KS, KR, DH, 3 ACPs, and a thioesterase (TE) domain. It does not contain an <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER) domain, which would be required for the complete reduction to the nine-carbon fatty acid. MupE is a single-domain protein that shows sequence similarity to known ER domains and may complete the reaction. It also remains possible that 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid is derived partially or entirely from outside of the mupirocin cluster.|$|E
50|$|Based {{on basic}} polyketide synthesis, the {{biosynthesis}} of annonacin is likely accomplished by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS). The biosynthesis likely {{involves the use}} of 17 modules consisting of a number of enzymes commonly found in PKS. These include the acyl carrier protein (ACP), acetyl transferase (AT), ketosynthase (KS), malonyl transferase (MT; which can come carrying a variety of functionalities), ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER). An example of the possible modular biosynthetic pathway detailing the combination of these enzymes and the subsequent modules {{can be seen in the}} figure below.|$|E
50|$|As β-oxidation begins, FAD dehydrogenates acyl-CoA to form trans-Δ2-enoyl-CoA and FADH2. Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase catalyses {{a double}} bond in this step. Next, trans-Δ2-enoyl-CoA is {{hydrogenated}} by <b>enoyl</b> CoA hydratase to form L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA. NAD+ and the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase oxidize L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA to form β-ketoacyl CoA and NADH. Lastly, the β-ketoacyl CoA is cleaved by a thiol group in CoA to form another acyl-CoA and an acetyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by thiolase. The acyl-CoA is two carbons shorter than before, so it enters β-oxidation again until it all converts into acetyl-CoA.|$|E
50|$|Like FASs, PKSs {{will use}} a β-ketoacylsynthase (KS), an {{optional}} (malonyl)acyl transferase (MAT/AT), and a phosphopantethienylated acyl carrier protein (ACP) or coenzymeA (CoA). They also both used a ketoreductase, dehydratase, and <b>enoyl</b> reductase to create a fully saturated acyl backbone. Unlike FASs, however, PKSs typically use {{a larger number of}} biosynthetic building blocks and form a more varied number of tail lengths. The reductive steps that FASs use are also optional for the PKSs. By potentially omitting them, there is potential for a more complex pattern of functionalization.|$|E
50|$|Ethionamide may be {{bacteriostatic}} or bactericidal in action, {{depending on}} the concentration of the drug attained {{at the site of}} infection and the susceptibility of the infecting organism. Ethionamide, like prothionamide and pyrazinamide, is a nicotinic acid derivative related to isoniazid. It is thought that ethionamide undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the <b>enoyl</b> reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA.|$|E
50|$|Fatty acids are {{aliphatic}} acids {{fundamental to}} energy production and storage, cellular structure and as intermediates in the biosynthesis of hormones and other biologically important molecules. They are synthesized {{by a series}} of decarboxylative Claisen condensation reactions from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Following each round of elongation the beta keto group is reduced to the fully saturated carbon chain by the sequential action of a ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER). The growing fatty acid chain is carried between these active sites while attached covalently to the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of an acyl carrier protein (ACP), and is released by the action of a thioesterase (TE) upon reaching a carbon chain length of 16 (palmitidic acid).|$|E
50|$|Although the biosynthetic pathway of callystatin A has {{not been}} {{explicitly}} described, its polyketide structure indicates that the pathway must involve the polyketide synthase (PKS) enzyme complex. In general, in a modular fashion, an acetate starting unit in the loading module is extended by two carbons each time by the ketosynthase (KS) domain. The acyl groups are loaded onto the acyl carrier protein (ACP) {{with the help of}} the acyltransferase (AT) domain. Each module contains different combinations of the ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER) domains that can modify and tailor the two-carbon subunits to form the resulting fatty acid chain. The final module contains a thioesterase (TE) domain that hydrolyzes the thioester bond to release the fatty acid chain and coenzyme A.|$|E
50|$|Epothilone B {{starts with}} a 2-methyl-4-carboxythiazole starter unit, which was formed through the {{translational}} coupling between PKS, EPOS A (epoA) module, and NRPS, EPOS P(epoP) module. The EPOS A contains a modified β-ketoacyl-synthase (malonyl-ACP decarboxylase, KSQ), an acyltransferase (AT), an <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER), and an acyl carrier protein domain (ACP). The EPOS P however, contains a heterocylization, an adenylation, an oxidase, and a thiolation domain. These domains are important because {{they are involved in}} the formation of the five-membered heterocyclic ring of the thiazole. As seen in Figure 4, the EPOS P activates the cysteine and binds the activated cysteine as an aminoacyl-S-PCP. Once the cysteine has been bound, EPOS A loads an acetate unit onto the EPOS P complex, thus initiating the formation of the thiazoline ring by intramolecular cyclodehydration.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes an {{accessory}} enzyme that {{participates in the}} beta oxidation and metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty enoyl-CoA esters. Specifically, it catalyzes the reduction of 2,4 Dienoyl-CoA thioesters of varying length by NADPH cofactor to 3-trans-enoyl-CoA of equivalent length. Unlike the breakdown of saturated fat, cis and trans polyunsaturated fatty acid degradation requires three additional enzymes to generate a product compatible with the standard beta oxidation pathway. DECR is the second such enzyme (The others being <b>Enoyl</b> CoA isomerase and Dienoyl CoA isomerase) and is the rate limiting step in this auxiliary flow. DECR is capable of reducing both 2-trans,4-cis-dienoyl-CoA and 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA thioesters, as well as double bonds at odd carbon positions, with equal efficiency. At this time, {{there is no clear}} explanation for this of lack of stereo-specificity.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{route to}} {{synthesis}} includes polyketide synthase components.The carbon chains of Amphotericin B are assembled from sixteen ‘C2’ acetate and three ‘C3’propionate units by polyketide synthases (PKSs). Polyketide biosynthesis {{begins with the}} decarboxylative condensation of a dicarboxylic acid extender unit with a starter acyl unit to form a β-ketoacyl intermediate. The growing chain is constructed {{by a series of}} Claisen reactions. Within each module, the extender units are loaded onto the current ACP domain by acetyl transferase (AT). The ACP-bound elongation group reacts in a Claisen condensation with the KS-bound polyketide chain. Ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER) enzymes may also be present to form alcohol, double bonds or single bonds. After cyclisation, the macrolactone core undergoes further modification by hydroxylation, methylation and glycosylation. The order of these processes is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,4 Dienoyl-CoA Reductase from Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) shares {{very similar}} kinetic {{properties}} {{to that of}} eukaryotes, but differs significantly in both structure and mechanism. In addition to NADPH, E. Coli DECR requires a set of FAD, FMN and iron-sulfur cluster molecules to complete the electron transfer. A further distinction is E. Coli DECR produces the final 2-trans-enoyl-CoA {{without the need for}} <b>Enoyl</b> CoA Isomerase. The active site contains accurately positioned Tyr199 that donates a proton to the Cγ after hydride attack at the Cδ, completing the reduction in a single concerted step. Surprisingly, mutation of the Tyr199 does not eliminate enzyme activity but instead changes the product to 3-trans-enoyl-CoA. The current explanation is that Glu164, an acidic residue in the active site, acts as a proton donor to Cα when Tyr199 is not present.|$|E
50|$|Epothilone B is a 16-membered polyketide macrolactone with a methylthiazole group {{connected}} to the macrocycle by an olefinic bond. The polyketide backbone was synthesized by type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and the thiazole ring was derived from a cysteine incorporated by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). In this biosythesis, both PKS and NRPS use carrier proteins, which have been post-translationally modified by phosphopantheteine groups, to join the growing chain. PKS uses coenzyme-A thioester to catalyze the reaction and modify the substrates by selectively reducing the β carbonyl to the hydroxyl (Ketoreductase, KR), the alkene (Dehydratase, DH), and the alkane (<b>Enoyl</b> Reductase, ER). PKS-I can also methylate the α carbon of the substrate. NRPS, on the other hand, uses amino acids activated on the enzyme as aminoacyl adenylates. Unlike PKS, epimerization, N-methylation, and heterocycle formation occurs in NRPS enzyme.|$|E
50|$|Mycolactone {{consists}} of a 12-membered macrolide core with an ester-linked polyketide chain. Three plasmid-encoded polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes are responsible for its production: MLSA 1 and MLSA 2 which generate the core, and MLSB {{is responsible for the}} synthesis of the polyketide chain. As shown in Figure 1, MLSB (1.2 MDa) contains seven consecutive extension modules and MLSA 1 (1.8 MDa) {{consists of}} eight. The remaining PKS enzyme, MLSA 2, contains the ninth module of MLSA. The C-terminal domains of both MLSA2 and MLSB includes a thioesterase (TE) that was thought to catalyze the formation of the mycolactone core but appears inactive. Each module consists of either malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA Acyltransferase (AT) that allows for chain extension, a ketosynthase (KS), which catalyzes chain elongation, and an Acyl carrier protein (ACP) where the growing polyketide chain is attached. Modules may also consist of any of the following modifying domains: a dehydratase (DH), an <b>enoyl</b> reductase (ER) and one of two types of ketoreductase (KR) domains. Type A and B KRs refer to the two directions of ketoreduction that are correlated with specific amino acids in the active site. Four of the DH domains are predicted to be inactive based on a point mutation found in the active site sequence.Figure 1. Domain Organization of Mycolactone.|$|E
5000|$|Mitochondria (both short- and {{long-chain}}) of rat liver {{contain more}} than one <b>enoyl</b> Co-A isomerase. To further {{support the idea that}} short- and long-chain isomerases elute at different concentration of potassium phosphate concentration, they do not share similar primary polypeptide structure, hence they must not be evolutionarily related. Peroxisomes of plants and of rat liver are very different in the way they operate. Despite their primary structure similarities, there are differences among the different specimen. To begin with, the peroxisomes of rat liver are a multifunctional enzyme including enoyl-CoA isomerase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, and L-(−)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Three different enzymes reside on this entity (multifunctional protein) allowing this enzyme to perform isomerization, hydration, and dehydration. Isomerase activity on the multifunctional enzyme occurs at the amino-terminal catalytic half of the protein along with the hydratase activity. The dehydrogenase activity of enoyl-CoA occurs in the carboxyl-terminal. Upon further investigation of the CoA binding site on the amino-terminal half of the multifunctional protein, the CoA substrate is not transferred through the aqueous phase from the isomerization phase to the site of hydration or does not have a bulk phase. This removes the need for a substrate transferring enzyme. On the other hand, the cotyledons convert long-chain 3-trans-enoyl-CoA, long-chain 3-cis-enoyl-CoA, and short-chain 3-cis-enoyl-CoA species into their 2- trans-enoyl-CoA respective forms. As previously mentioned, plant enoyl-CoA isomerase exclusively forms the 2-trans isomer as product. It does not act on 4-cis-enoyl-CoA species or 2-trans- 4-trans-dienoyl-CoA species. [...] In comparing the products of the plant peroxisome and the multifunctional enzyme of rat liver, the plant has no hydratase activity. The Plant form did not form a 2-cis-isomer (from enoyl-CoA hydratase) or D- or L- 3 hydroxy derivative (L-(−)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase): products of multifunctional enzyme of rat liver. The turnover rates of these the two sub divisions of peroxisomes are very different. The Kcat/Km ratio in cotyledons is 10^6 M-1s-1 which outperforms the ratio [...]07 * 10^6 M-1s-1. Due to a high turnover rate, the plant peroxisomes contain a lesser amount of enoyl-CoA isomerase than their counterparts in the rat liver.|$|E
40|$|The polyketide-derived macrolactone of the {{antibiotic}} erythromycin is made through successive condensation and processing of seven three-carbon units. The fourth cycle involves complete processing {{of the newly}} formed beta-keto group (beta-keto reduction, dehydration, and <b>enoyl</b> reduction) to yield the methylene that will appear at C- 7 of the lactone ring. Synthesis of this molecule in Saccharopolyspora erythraea {{is determined by the}} three large eryA genes, organized in six modules, each governing one condensation cycle. Two amino acid substitutions were introduced in the putative NAD(P) H binding motif in the proposed <b>enoyl</b> reductase domain encoded by eryAII. The metabolite produced by the resulting strain was identified as delta 6, 7 -anhydroerythromycin C resulting from failure of <b>enoyl</b> reduction during the fourth cycle of synthesis of the macrolactone. This result demonstrates the involvement of at least the <b>enoyl</b> reductase from the fourth module in the fourth cycle and indicates that a virtually complete macrolide can be produced through reprogramming of polyketide synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Natural product {{chemical}} {{diversity is}} fuelled by the emergence and ongoing evolution of biosynthetic pathways in secondary metabolism. However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diversification {{is not well}} understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity from Lyngbya majuscula form a beta-branched cyclopropane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halogenase, a 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for polyketide beta-branching, and an <b>enoyl</b> reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH(1) s), decarboxylases (ECH(2) s) and <b>enoyl</b> reductase domains from both Cur and Jam, were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation. Unexpectedly, the polyketide beta-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a gamma-chlorination step on (S) - 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(ii), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme. In a divergent scheme, Cur ECH(2) was found to catalyse formation of the alpha,beta <b>enoyl</b> thioester, whereas Jam ECH(2) formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding beta,gamma <b>enoyl</b> thioester of the 3 -methyl- 4 -chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the <b>enoyl</b> reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH(2) instead of the canonical alpha,beta C = C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide beta-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH(2) and <b>enoyl</b> reductase, leads {{to the formation of}} cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events in multienzyme systems leading to functional group diversity in secondary metabolites...|$|E
