5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, as {{fear of crime}} became Jeffersonians' No. 1 concern, Lee sensed his {{continued}} political fortunes would <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with reforming the Sheriff's Office than in making his suburban constituents feel safe from the big city ills.|$|E
25|$|Another example are {{historical}} role-playing sims such as 1880s Victorian London and The 1920s Berlin Project. While only {{encouraged to}} do so in 1880s Victorian London, visitors to the 1920s Berlin Project are required to dress accurately as part of the history based immersive experience. Sims may incorporate rules that <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with thematic realism, and more to do with adhering to community guidelines. For instance, one rule that is commonly seen is the prohibition or restriction of underage avatars in role-playing sims that feature sexual content; these rules are separate from Linden Labs' sim restrictions, as they restrict underage characters played by adult players.|$|E

25|$|Tax {{choice is}} {{the theory that}} taxpayers should have more control with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E
500|$|Conspicuousness and {{toxicity}} may be inversely related, as polymorphic poison dart frogs {{that are}} less conspicuous are more toxic than the brightest and most conspicuous species. [...] Energetic costs of producing toxins and bright color pigments lead to potential trade-offs between toxicity and bright coloration, and prey with strong secondary defenses <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> gain from costly signaling. Therefore, prey populations that are more toxic are predicted to manifest less bright signals, opposing the classical view that increased conspicuousness always evolves with increased toxicity.|$|E
500|$|Indigenous {{people in}} North and South America {{conceptualized}} a third gender for men-women and women-men. These roles were recorded of the Coahuiltecan Indians in Texas, Timucuan in Florida, and Cueva in Panama. In Cree, {{the term for}} a man who took the role of a woman was ayekkwew; the Zuni word for a woman who took the role of a man was katsotse (boy-girl), and the Mohave give women the term hwame. The cross-gender roles <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with sexuality than with spirituality and occupation. A [...] "two-spirit" [...] woman who has a relationship with a non cross-gender woman is thought to be a [...] "hetero-gender" [...] relationship.|$|E

500|$|Banquo's {{status as}} a {{contrast}} to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ("Hold, take my sword... Take thee that too"). He also explains {{that he has been}} having trouble sleeping due to [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – all she can think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 17, 2008, Tancredo {{alleged that}} Pope Benedict XVI was {{encouraging}} illegal {{immigration to the}} USA to boost membership in the Catholic Church. In response to a statement by the Pope at a Mass in Washington, Tancredo stated, [...] "I suspect the Pope's immigration comments may <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with spreading the gospel than they do about recruiting new members of the church." [...] While Tancredo was raised a Catholic, he now attends Cherry Hills Community Church, an evangelical Christian church.|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{intended}} {{to begin a}} concert career, but she made her debut at age 17 with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. There she created the leading role of Casilda in The Gondoliers, the last great Gilbert and Sullivan hit, which opened at the Savoy Theatre on 7 December 1889. W. S. Gilbert {{asked her if she}} had ever acted. When she replied in the negative, he replied, [...] "So much the better; you'll <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> unlearn!"

2500|$|British battle {{casualties}} were 30 killed and 58 wounded, [...] {{but the end}} of the siege was an urgent necessity for Stuart as the summer heat was severely affecting his troops, which were severely reduced in number by malaria and dysentery which had swept though the camp so virulently that just 400 men were still fit for duty at the surrender of Calvi. [...] This explains the generous terms, by which 300 French soldiers and 247 Corsican supporters were given safe passage back to France. The surrender provoked angry protests from Britain's allies Austria and Sardinia, whose armies were fighting the French in Italy, but these complaints were dismissed by the new viceroy of Corsica Sir Gilbert Elliot, who suggested that they would <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> complain about if they were more effective opponents of the French. Lord Hood also complained about the terms, criticising Stuart in letters to political allies in Britain. He accused the army commander of [...] "great tenderness", due to his refusal to bombard French hospitals during the siege, opining that this unnecessarily prolonged the operation. Historian Desmond Gregory suggests that this was motivated more by his omission from Stuart's dispatches to London, and notes that Hood immediately reembarked the sailors stationed ashore and departed following the surrender, leaving Stuart to handle management of the captured town and stores with his severely reduced forces.|$|E
