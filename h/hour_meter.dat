50|$|The next {{series of}} Cub Cadets is {{commonly}} known as the Quiet Line series. Models 1000, 1100, 1200, 1250, 1450, and 1650 made up this series. These were the first Cub Cadets to feature alternators instead of starter generators. The ten-horsepower 1000 and the twelve horsepower 1200 contained a three-speed direct drive transmission and replaced the previous models 86, 108, and 128 respectively. The hydrostatic twelve horsepower 1250, fourteen horsepower 1450, and sixteen horsepower 1650 replaced the previous 129, 149, and 169 models respectively. Hydraulic lift was a standard feature on the models 1450 and 1650. Notice how International dropped the ten horsepower hydrostatic model. These models outward appearance is distinguished by engine side covers. These covers combined with engine ISO mounts, extra shrouding, and a larger muffler made this series significantly quieter than previous series of Cub Cadets. Production of these models ran from 1974 to 1979 making this series Internationals the longest produced series of Cub Cadets. International produced the Cub Cadet model 800 in 1974. The eight horsepower Kohler powered 800 was one of International's answers to compete with the cheap garden tractors made by MTD and Murray sold in box stores. The model 800 contained all of the same features as the models 1000 and 1200 such as the ISO mounts, side covers, and the three speed direct drive transmission. The 800's superior quality made it cost more than the cheap garden tractors sold in box stores. Because of this, only a few 800s were sold and it was unable to compete with the cheap box store garden tractors. This lead International to cease the production of the model 800 in 1976. The Mistake of trying to beat MTD at their own game eventually became fatal. Because there are less than 3,000 model 800s produced, they are the rarest Cub Cadets made. The Cub Cadet model 1100 was another answer International had to the lawn tractors sold in box stores. The model 1100 was an economy model which eliminated the engine side covers, and other parts to reduce cost. The 1100 was the first Cub Cadet garden tractor to deviate from the Kohler engine using an 11-horsepower Briggs and Stratton engine. The model 1100 also used a belt-driven four-speed Peerless transmission, had a striped down dash without an ammeter or <b>hour</b> <b>meter,</b> a metal fuel tank all to reduce cost. The model 1100 was produced through the entire production run of this series.|$|E

40|$|The net {{radiation}} (Rn) in agroecosystems {{is the amount}} of energy that is available in the environment to heating processes of living organisms, air and soil; perspiration of animals and plants; photosynthesis and water evaporation. The Rn defines the type of climate and weather conditions prevailing in a region affecting the availability and thermal water, the fundamental understanding of genotype-environment, which ultimately determine the productivity of the agricultural system. Rn usually is used in models of weather and climate studies. The sustainability and economic viability of zootechnical activity is dependent on the positive interaction between animal and environment. Environmental factors such as water, shading, thermal exchanges sensible heat (conduction, convection and radiation skin) and latent heat losses (evaporation and transpiration), conditioned by Rn, must be managed to provide the best results. The present study was conducted to develop and test models for accurate and precise radiation balance on the scales daily, monthly and seasonal ten-day for Jaboticabal - SP, due to the importance of estimates of {{net radiation}} for agricultural activities. We used daily meteorological data from weather station located in Jaboticabal, SP (coordinates: 21 ° 14 ' 05 "South, 48 ° 17 ' 09 " West, 615 m altitude) at Universidade Estadual Paulista "Júlio Mesquita Filho" - FCAV/UNESP in a situation of default grass "Bahiagrass" during the period 20 / 08 / 2005 to 20 / 01 / 2012. The data used were the maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum (Tmin) and mean (TMED); maximum relative humidity (URMáx), minimum (URMín) and average (URMéd) precipitation (mm), average velocity (m/s), Qo, solar radiation (MJ m- 2), sunshine (<b>hour)</b> <b>meter</b> (MJ m²), soil temperature at two depths (Tsoil 2 CM, Tsoil 5 CM) and class A pan evaporation (TCA) (mm). The measures taken by the balance radiometer were taken as a reference to test other models. The models tested were those reported by NORMAN et al. 1995 and PRIESTLEY and TAYLOR, 1972. The models used were developed and tested regressions with MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), R² (Accuracy) and RMSEs (root mean error quadratic systematic) in different time scales. The mechanistic models, PRIESTLEY-TAYLOR and NORMAN, had low accuracy in all analyzes; the maximum MAPE was equal to 498. 12 %. This was due to the high amplitude of the estimated data regarding observed, making the R² values (accuracy) low. The equation used all data, called Rn = f (all), in most cases showed the best result. However, for the purpose of practical use was not indicated because his job will be to need a lot of information collection difficult. The standard methodology for estimating Rn is recommended by FAO, however, this method presents some difficulties to be measured is required sensor (balance-radiometer) which often has the meteorological its high value. Thus, the use of regressions using Qg as an indicator ends up getting compromised handling. By equations using Q 0 as the independent variable is the most suitable. Seeking greater practicality without losing the precision, accuracy and utilization. The equation Rn = f (Q 0, n) in this work is indicated by having high precision and high convenience for use...|$|E
