5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on to throw a no-hitter for another team. The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden,</b> Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, had never had a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2013, Fernández was {{selected}} to represent the Miami Marlins for the National League All Star team. He pitched a perfect 6th inning in the 2013 All-Star Game in which he struck out Dustin Pedroia, induced Miguel Cabrera to pop up for a flyout and struck Chris Davis out. With this performance, Fernández {{is one of only}} three pitchers {{in the history of the}} All-Star Game who struck out two batters prior to their 21st birthday for their All-Star debut, the other two being <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> and Bob Feller.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, 2014, deGrom {{faced the}} Marlins {{and struck out}} his first eight batters, tying the MLB record. Near {{the end of the}} season, deGrom was shut down for the year, ending his season with a 9–6 record, a 2.69 ERA and 144 strikeouts. DeGrom won the 2014 Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year Award and was named the NL Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, (the first by a Met since <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> in 1984) {{receiving}} first place votes on 26 of the 30 ballots.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{started his}} sophomore {{campaign}} as the Opening Day starter for the Marlins, {{making him the}} youngest Opening Day starting pitcher since <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> in 1986. Fernández recorded nine strikeouts while walking none, and he joined Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins, Walter Johnson, and Cy Young as the only pitchers to do so on Opening Day. On May 12, Fernández {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to a right elbow sprain. An MRI revealed that the elbow had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which prematurely ended Fernández's 2014 season. He underwent Tommy John surgery on May 16. He made eight starts, going 4–2 with a 2.44 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Four Mets' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. No first-round picks {{were on the}} 1969 championship team. Outfielders Lee Mazzilli (1973) and Darryl Strawberry (1980), shortstop Wally Backman (1977), and pitcher <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> (1982) played in the 1986 World Series for the Mets' second championship team. Three first-round draft picks {{have gone on to}} win the Rookie of the Year Award with the Mets: Jon Matlack in 1972, Strawberry in 1983, and Gooden in 1984. Gooden {{went on to win the}} Cy Young Award in 1985, his second season, after placing second in the voting his rookie year. Gooden is also the only first-round draft pick of the Mets to make the All-Star team in his rookie season.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{originally}} planned to bring Taylor {{up through the}} minor leagues rapidly, like the Mets did with <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden.</b> However, they found he needed a better move to first base to hold base runners, and chose not to expedite his major league debut. Before even playing a game, he was named the game's top prospect by Baseball America before the 1992 season. He began his professional career with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, the Yankees' Class-A Advanced minor league affiliate. His performances with Fort Lauderdale included throwing nine strikeouts against the Osceola Astros in an 85 victory, {{as well as a}} 12-strikeout, two-hit performance in September against the West Palm Beach Expos. For the season, Taylor had a 68 win-loss record, a 2.57 ERA, and 187 strikeouts in 161.1 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{was drafted}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 MLB draft. He {{worked his way through}} the Dodgers' farm system in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was the {{youngest}} player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years when he did so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> (born 1964), former MLB pitcher for the New York Mets.|$|E
25|$|He is {{the nephew}} of <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden.</b> After retirement, he started to work as an agent. His current clients include Texas Rangers {{reliever}} Jason Grilli.|$|E
25|$|Mets ace <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> {{once again}} struggled, this time {{surrendering}} four runs on nine hits {{in just four}} innings. Despite a strong relief effort from Sid Fernandez, Bruce Hurst was dominant again, allowing ten hits and just two runs in a complete game win to give Boston a 3–2 series lead heading back to New York.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Ryan's Astros {{faced the}} New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. Ryan had a shaky start in Game2, taking the loss. He {{returned}} in Game5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, {{but one of}} those hits was a Darryl Strawberry home run which tied the game at 1–1, as <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield {{was born}} in Tampa, Florida, {{and grew up in}} Belmont Heights, near the Ponce de Leon projects. He and his family lived with his uncle, <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden,</b> who would go on to become the ace pitcher for the New York Mets. They played {{baseball}} frequently and Sheffield learned how to hit a fastball from Gooden, who is only four years older than he is. Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant positive impact on his life, influencing him as a person and as an athlete.|$|E
25|$|During {{the regular}} season on July 8, 2000, the Yankees {{defeated}} the Mets by identical 4-2 scores in both ends of an unusual day-night doubleheader. With the first game played at Shea Stadium and the nightcap at Yankee Stadium, {{it was the first}} time since 1903 that two teams played two games in different stadiums on the same day. <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> won the first game with a six inning effort in his first start since returning to the Yankees. Roger Clemens won the nightcap. However, in the second game of that double header, an event occurred that made the rivalry between the two teams more contentious. Clemens hit Mets' star Mike Piazza in the helmet with an inside fastball, causing Piazza to suffer a concussion and placing him on the disabled list.|$|E
500|$|Tom Seaver {{holds the}} Mets' {{record for most}} Opening Day starts with 11, and has an Opening Day record of 60. He also has the most starts in Shea Stadium, the Mets' home {{ballpark}} from 1964 through 2008. [...] Seaver and <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> hold the Mets' record for most Opening Day wins with six each. [...] Al Jackson and Roger Craig share the worst winning percentage as the Opening Day starting pitcher {{with a record of}} 02.|$|E
500|$|From 1968 through 1983, Mets' Opening Day {{starting}} pitchers went 16 consecutive {{years without a}} loss. [...] During this period, Tom Seaver won sixstarts with fiveno decisions, Craig Swan won twostarts, and Jerry Koosman, Pat Zachry and Randy Jones won onestart apiece. [...] Furthermore, in the 31-year period from 1968 through 1998, Mets' Opening Day {{starting pitchers}} only lost two games. [...] During that period, they won 19games with 10no decisions. [...] The only losses during this period were by Mike Torrez in 1984 and by <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> in 1990.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recipient}} of the Cy Young Award was Don Newcombe of the Dodgers. In 1957, Warren Spahn became the first left-handed pitcher to win the award. In 1963, Sandy Koufax became the first pitcher to win the award in a unanimous vote; two years later {{he became the first}} multiple winner. In 1978, Gaylord Perry (age 40) became the oldest pitcher to receive the award, a record that stood until broken in 2004 by Roger Clemens (age 42). The youngest recipient was <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> (age 20 in 1985). [...] In 2012, R.A. Dickey became the first knuckleball pitcher to win the award.|$|E
500|$|After the season, Kershaw {{was awarded}} the Warren Spahn Award as the best left-handed pitcher in 2011, the Players Choice Award for Most Outstanding National League pitcher, the Gold Glove Award as the top fielding pitcher in the NL [...] and the Sporting News (TSN) National League Pitcher of the Year. He was {{additionally}} selected as the starting pitcher for the TSN NL All-Star Team. On November 17, he was honored with the National League Cy Young Award, making him the youngest Cy Young winner since <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> of the 1985 New York Mets. He was the 8th Dodger pitcher to win the award, the first since Éric Gagné in the 2003 season.|$|E
500|$|Overall, Mets Opening Day {{starting}} pitchers {{have a record}} of 01 at the Polo Grounds, a 135 record with fourno decisions at Shea Stadium and a 20 record with threeno decisions at Citi Field. [...] In addition, although the Mets were nominally the home team in 2000, the game was played in Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan. Mike Hampton started the game in Tokyo and lost, making the Mets' Opening Day {{starting pitchers}}' combined home record 147, and their away record 125. The Mets went on to play in the World Series in 1969, 1973, 1986, 2000 and 2015, and won the 1969 and 1986 World Series championship games. Tom Seaver (1969 and 1973), <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> (1986), Mike Hampton (2000) and Bartolo Colón (2015) were the Opening Day starting pitchers when the Mets played in the World Series, and they had a combined Opening Day record of 31 with one no decision.|$|E
500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden)</b> career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break it from me because I know I'm not any big deal".|$|E
500|$|Johan Santana, José Altuve, and Miguel Cabrera are {{the only}} players to win the Luis Aparicio Award more than once, with Cabrera having won the award five times. [...] Cabrera won the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award and Hank Aaron Award {{alongside}} the Luis Aparicio Award in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first and—as of 2013—only Venezuelan to win the MLB MVP Award. [...] Santana, the 2004 and 2006 recipient, also won the Cy Young Award in those two years, winning by a unanimous vote on each occasion. [...] Santana (2006) and Cabrera (2012) {{are the only}} award winners to also earn the pitching and batting Triple Crown respectively in the same season. [...] In accomplishing the feat, Cabrera became the first player in 45 years to achieve a Triple Crown in batting since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, while Santana became the first pitcher since <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> in 1985 to secure a [...] "Major League Triple Crown" [...] by leading all of MLB in wins, earned run average and strikeouts. [...] Francisco Rodríguez compiled a major league record of 62 saves in a single season in 2008 {{and went on to}} win the Rolaids Relief Man Award in the same year as the Luis Aparicio Award. [...] Four winners—Cabrera, Altuve, [...] Magglio Ordóñez, and Carlos González—were batting champions in their respective leagues in the same year they won the award.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, the Mets {{came into}} Philadelphia for a three-game {{series against the}} Phillies. The Mets were [...] games out of first with six games left: three against the Phillies and the last three against the first-place Cardinals. They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How does it feel now? Empty? Not yet. But we need to get help. When you play 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|The Mets won the National League East by [...] {{games in}} 1986, but the Phillies {{were the only}} team to post a winning record against them, {{including}} winning 7 of 9 at Veterans Stadium. On September 12, up by 22 games, the Mets came to Philadelphia for a three game weekend series needing one win to clinch the division. The Mets brought champagne to Philadelphia. Before the series, Mets manager Davey Johnson told the Associated Press, [...] "It will be nice to clinch in Philadelphia. It gives {{us a chance to}} beat the only team in our way...I have a nice warm feeling about this." [...] He told The Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "For the fans...it would be nicer to clinch at home. But for the safety...and the livelihood of the players...it's better to do it on the road." [...] In the series opener, Mike Schmidt hit a three-run homer, Phillies rookie Bruce Ruffin out pitched the Mets' <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden,</b> and the Phillies won, 6–3. The Phillies won the second game of the series, 6–5; visiting Mets fans became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck. One Mets fan was arrested after hitting two Philadelphia police officers. The Phillies completed the sweep by beating the Mets, 6–0, behind a shutout from Kevin Gross, drove in two runs with a fourth-inning triple. The Mets would clinch the division at Shea Stadium on September 17. After the season, the Phils' Schmidt won the National League MVP Award, ahead of the Mets' Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez who finished third and fourth.|$|E
2500|$|Dickey won the NL Cy Young Award, {{beating out}} Gio González of the Nationals and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. He {{became the first}} knuckleballer in MLB history to win the award.

2500|$|In 1987, Sheffield and his uncle, MLB player <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden,</b> {{were arrested}} after {{fighting}} with police and resisting arrest in Tampa, Florida.

2500|$|Cone {{spent over}} five seasons {{in his first}} stint with the New York Mets, {{most of the time}} serving as the team's co-ace {{alongside}} <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> while leading the National League in strikeouts in 1990 and 1991. In 1991, Cone switched from uniform number 44 to 17 in honor of former teammate Keith Hernandez. On August 30, he struck out three batters on nine pitches in the fifth inning of a 3–2 win over the Cincinnati Reds. He became the 16th National League pitcher and the 25th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat.|date=February 2015}} ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] season {{came down}} to the wire between the Mets and St. Louis Cardinals. On September 10, with the two teams tied atop the NL East, an {{incident}} between Foster and Cardinals pitcher Danny Cox caused both benches to clear. The race remained tight, but the Cardinals pulled off a three-game lead as the Mets headed to Busch Stadium for a three-game set on October 1. Game one was a pitchers' duel between Ron Darling and John Tudor that the Mets won in extra innings. With the Mets now just two games back, 20 game winners <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> and Joaquín Andújar faced off in game two.|$|E
2500|$|After {{dropping}} the first game, the Mets turned to young phenom <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> in what figured to be a classic matchup with Boston's own young pitching sensation Roger Clemens. That duel did not materialize, as neither pitcher went beyond five innings. [...] The Red Sox drew first {{blood in the}} top of the third inning, when after a leadoff walk to Spike Owen, Keith Hernandez fielded a Clemens bunt, but threw it away trying to catch Owen at second base. [...] This was costly, as Wade Boggs drove in Owen with a double, Marty Barrett drove in Clemens with a single, and Bill Buckner drove in Boggs with a single to give the Sox a 3–0 lead.|$|E
2500|$|After {{four seasons}} in Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the San Diego Padres for Ricky Bones, José Valentin, and Matt Mieske on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced his uncle <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> {{for the first}} time in a Major League game on May 12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first All-Star season, he contended for the Triple Crown for much of the year; while he missed out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, {{teammate}} Fred McGriff) and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader Darren Daulton) titles, he won the National League batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history not won by Tony Gwynn) with a [...]330 average.|$|E
2500|$|Kazmir {{started the}} [...] season opener April 3 at Baltimore. At 22 years, 2 months and 10 days Kazmir was the {{youngest}} opening day starter since <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> with the Mets in 1986. He lost the decision after 6 ER in 4 IP, but was subsequently extremely impressive with an overall 10–8 record with 163 strikeouts and a 3.24 ERA in 144.2 innings pitched. Kazmir has won decisions against Cy Young winner Roy Halladay, two-time 20 game winner Jamie Moyer, two-time All Star and 20 game winner Dontrelle Willis, 2001 World Series co-MVP and 3-time 20 game winner Curt Schilling, 2003 World Series MVP Josh Beckett and Tim Wakefield, who is 14–2 lifetime against the Rays.|$|E
2500|$|The {{founding}} of the Bleacher Creatures is often credited to Ali Ramirez. Ramirez rang a cowbell to inspire the fans to cheer (much like Freddy Sez's efforts in the Stadium's main grandstand) during the team's limited success in the early 1980s and 1990s. He died on May 8, 1996, and was given a tribute by the Yankees front office before the May 14 game against the Seattle Mariners, {{a game in which}} <b>Dwight</b> <b>Gooden</b> pitched a no-hitter. There was a plaque where he sat, in section 39, row A, seat 29 which read [...] "This seat is taken. In memory of Ali Ramirez, 'The Original Bleacher Creature.'" [...] A similar plaque was added to the new stadium,. and is cleaned by a Creature at the start of every game. The plaque is located at section 203, row 7, seat 25.|$|E
2500|$|Tulowitzki {{made his}} debut with the Blue Jays on July 29, and went 3–5 {{with a home}} run, 2 doubles, 3 RBI, and 3 runs scored. During {{a game against the}} New York Yankees on September 12, Tulowitzki {{collided}} with teammate Kevin Pillar while backpedaling to catch a fly ball in centerfield, and had to leave the game. He was expected to be out for a minimum of 2-3 weeks due to a cracked shoulder blade. Tulowitzki returned to the lineup shortly {{before the end of the}} season after missing 18 games, and in total appeared in 41 games for the Blue Jays in 2015, batting [...]239 with 5 home runs and 17 RBI. He played in all 5 games of the 2015 American League Division Series, batting [...]095 with 1 home run and 4 RBI.
