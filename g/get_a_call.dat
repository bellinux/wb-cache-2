5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries to the dock and leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> about the missing delivery boy and head to the dock to investigate.|$|E

Later, the detectives <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after falling through the ceiling and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal.

Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to spend all his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television.

Later, they <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company.

500|$|Every so often, I’d <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> {{from the}} {{producer}} saying, it’s going {{out at this}} time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules {{in a year or}} so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|Mulder tells Scully his version. In his recollection, he is {{sensitive}} and polite to Scully, {{while she is}} dismissive and irritable, and clearly enamored with Sheriff Hartwell (who, in Mulder's version, is far less refined and has obvious buck teeth). While Scully is performing the autopsy, Mulder and Hartwell <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> {{to go to the}} local RV park, where there is [...] "a situation". They find another dead body, apparently a victim of the same attacker. Mulder returns to the motel room; after Scully has left, he eats her pizza and realizes that he has been drugged. Ronnie enters, with glowing green eyes, and prepares to attack Mulder, but Mulder manages to postpone his demise by scattering sunflower seeds all over the floor, which Ronnie compulsively starts to pick up. Scully enters and shoots Ronnie, but the bullets have no effect, and Ronnie runs out with Scully in pursuit. Mulder recovers from being drugged and chases after Ronnie.|$|E

500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging me the whole way. If I don't go down, I'm not going to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> because they are not going to make the call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{ultimately}} chose Albini {{to record}} its third album. [...] Albini {{had a reputation}} as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene. [...] While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, [...] "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [...] and Pod [...]" [...] Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. [...] Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. [...] Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. [...] Although he considered the group to be [...] "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" [...] and [...] "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be [...] "the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with", at the mercy of their record company. [...] Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. [...] In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album Rid of Me to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.|$|E

After making it to the top and defeating A.I.M. soldiers, Spider-Man combines the parts collected earlier to a computer, completing the generator. Jackal appears and steals the sonic generator.

[...] The Gibb family would also maintain it was not an overdose that killed Andy—as some papers suggested—but natural causes after years of drug and alcohol abuse.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, while {{promoting}} their film Funny People Apatow and Rogen {{appeared on}} The Howard Stern Show and defended {{the work in}} Knocked Up, disagreeing with the position Heigl had stated. Rogen pointed to Heigl's work in the film The Ugly Truth to illustrate his point. Rogen said: [...] "I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have {{to see if that}} is uplifting for women." [...] Apatow attempted to discredit Heigl's criticisms, chalking up her harsh words to exhaustion {{at the end of a}} long day of interviews and stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl. [...] "You would think at some point I'd <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> saying she was sorry, that she was tired, and then the call never comes." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Mr. Bungle themselves, Kiedis {{had never}} met or spoken to anyone {{involved}} with the band aside from Mike Patton. Patton stated to The A.V. Club, [...] "Our agent {{was in the process}} of booking these festivals, and it was becoming apparent that we'd landed some pretty good ones—one in France, another one in Holland, some big-name festivals. Turns out someone's holding a grudge! We were booted off several bills, specifically because Anthony Kiedis did not want us on the bill. He threatened to pull the Chili Peppers if Mr. Bungle was on the bill." [...] In a separate interview, he also clarified that [...] "the rest of the band doesn't care. It's something to do with Anthony." [...] Mr. Bungle's guitarist Trey Spruance added, [...] "We were booked, months in advance, to do eleven festival dates in Europe. Come Summer, we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> from the three biggest of those festivals, all of them the same day, saying that we can't play, because the headlining band retains the right to hire and fire whomever they wish. We found out it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so our manager called their manager to find out what the hell was going on, and their manager was very apologetic, and said, 'We're really sorry, we want you to know this doesn't reflect the management's position, or the band's for that matter, it's Anthony Kiedis who wants this.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. [...] "I'm {{really too}} old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds", O'Neal said, {{referring}} to the then 23-year-old Howard. [...] "It's not really my role anymore." [...] O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. [...] "I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was [...] "very disappointed cause [...] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight." [...] O'Neal responded, [...] "Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>call.</b> It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching." [...] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since [...] "everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back." [...] In a 2006 interview in TIME, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would [...] "Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singer Mike Patton {{was known}} {{to have had a}} bad {{relationship}} with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis, beginning when Kiedis saw Patton performing with Faith No More and accused him of imitating his style. California was scheduled to be released on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Kiedis had Mr. Bungle removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe; as the headlining act at the festivals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear. According to the band members themselves, Kiedis had never met or spoken to anyone involved with Mr. Bungle aside from Mike Patton. Patton explained to The A.V.
