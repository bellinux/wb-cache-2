5|$|In 2008, Carey <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{cancelled}} {{a concert}} tour supporting her eleventh studio album, E=MC². There was heavy speculation {{in the media}} that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned the plans for a tour as a result. The singer had later admitted {{that she was pregnant}} during that time period, and had suffered a miscarriage, leading to the cancellation of the tour.|$|E
5|$|Young schoolboy William Taswell had bolted {{from the}} early morning service in Westminster Abbey. He saw some {{refugees}} arrive in hired lighter boats near Westminster Stairs, a mile west of Pudding Lane, unclothed and covered only with blankets. The services of the lightermen <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> become extremely expensive, and only the luckiest refugees secured a place in a boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, pitting the {{champion}} Samoa Joe against the challenger Booker T, who was accompanied by Sharmell. The duration of the contest was 12 minutes and 44 seconds. Early in the bout, Booker T hit Joe {{in the face with}} a steel chair, resulting in Joe bleeding from the forehead. Later on, Booker T slammed Joe back-first onto two chairs with his signature Book End maneuver, however, Joe kicked out of a pinfall attempt. Joe gained the pinfall victory to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after bashing Booker T over the head with a guitar that had appeared in the ring after the lights <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> went off and back on.|$|E

5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{abandoned}} any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{throughout the course}} of the cyclone. The first cyclone watch related to Cyclone Winifred was declared by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) on 29January for various locations in Queensland, spanning from Thursday Island to Cooktown, and was adjusted as Winifred approached. The initial cyclone warning was issued on the morning of 30January, stretching between Cape Flattery and Townsville, while the previous cyclone watch was expanded to cover areas from Lockhart River to St Lawrence. The warning was later extended to reach Cooktown and Bowen, and was further lengthened to span regions from Cairns to St Lawrence. On the morning of 1February, observations indicated that the cyclone <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> veered toward the coast, and a Flash Tropical Cyclone Advice was subsequently released, noting the potential for powerful winds between Fitzroy Island and Innisfail. In conjunction, the Queensland Flood Warning Centre initiated flood warnings along the Tully, Herbert, Bulloo, Barcoo, Thomson, Diamantina, and Cooper waterways. The BoM also imposed a gale warning stretching from Cooktown to Cardwell, accompanied a strong wind warning between Cape Melville and Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương {{were caught}} off guard by the attacks. The initial {{perception}} was that the military establishment <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed {{to be a threat}} to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for the overthrow of the Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E

25|$|By 1887, Tampa {{city leaders}} had {{expressed}} concern about the lack of a trained police force in the rapidly growing “wild frontier town”. They also saw the potential to greatly increase the city’s tax rolls by gaining control of the prosperous community that <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> sprouted just outside the city limits. So on June 2, 1887, Tampa annexed Ybor City over the protestations of Ybor himself, who felt that relinquishing civil authority would add nothing to his company town except new regulations and red tape.|$|E
25|$|Lawler {{has stated}} several {{theories}} {{as to why}} he was allowed to leave. His first involves the ascent of Carter's career alongside the downfall of Chyna's. In his contention, Chyna was jealous of his wife's push inside the company, in part due to the Right to Censor storyline, and in part because of his wife's offer to pose for Playboy magazine. Until that time, Chyna had been the second major wrestling star from the World Wrestling Federation to have done a piece in Playboy (after Sable); during Chyna's debut on the adult magazine, she <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> broken her friendship with Carter.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the European {{cultural}} elite were discovering African, Oceanic and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Picasso were intrigued and {{inspired by the}} stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, Derain and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and tribal masks, {{in part because of}} the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.|$|E

25|$|According to AutoWeeks {{publication}} of Fiero firing squad, on October 6, 1983 a Pontiac engineer wrote an urgent memo {{to report that}} two Fieros <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> caught fire during test drives. This was only 3 months after {{the production of the}} Fiero began at the Pontiac plant. It was thought to be caused by antifreeze leaking out of badly installed hoses but in reality it was defective connecting rods. After one meeting with the Saginaw foundry manager, he wrote that “…60 percent to 90 percent of the rods produced do not exhibit defects.” This means at least every 1 out of 10 rods produced were defective and possibly 4 out of 10 were also defective.|$|E
25|$|Even though playoff success would elude the team, the Spurs <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> found {{themselves}} {{among the top}} teams in the ABA. Moreover, their gaudy attendance figures made them very attractive to the NBA, despite {{the size of the}} market. Although San Antonio had over 650,000 people at the time (and has since grown to become the seventh-largest city in the United States), it has always been a medium-sized market because the surrounding suburban and rural areas aren't much larger than the city itself. In June 1976, the ABA–NBA merger took place, moving San Antonio's sole professional sports franchise into a new league. The Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and New York Nets moved to the NBA for the 1976–77 season.|$|E
25|$|During the Indian President election, {{there was}} divided opinion between {{the leaders of}} Indian National Congress. Though the party {{nominated}} Dr.Sanjiva Reddy as the Official Candidate, the then Prime Minister, Mrs.Indira Gandhi <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> switched her allegiance to Dr.V.V.Giri, the Opposition-sponsored Candidate. She had also advised all party elected members to vote according to their conscience. Dr.V.V.Giri was elected as the President of India {{with the support of}} Mrs.Indira Gandhi. This has resulted in the split of Congress Party and in October 1969. Senior Leaders like Morarji Desai, Athulya Ghosh, Kamarajar, S K Patil and Nijalingappa on the one side as Congress (Organisation) and Indira Gandhi, Shankar Dayal Sharma, Jagjivan Ram, C Subramaniam on the Other Side as Congress (Indira). The DMK, led by Mr.Karunanidhi took a stance to support Mrs.Indira Gandhi in certain reforms like abolition of privy purse, nationalisation of Banks.|$|E

25|$|After the {{recapture}} of Schenkenschans in April 1636, the Spanish commander, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Spain, {{shifted his}} focus to France. This {{required that the}} Army of Flanders {{move away from the}} Dutch border; therefore the military threat Spain posed to the Dutch Republic lessened. In the summer of 1636 the Cardinal-Infante reached as far as Corbie, but this city was retaken by the French in November, {{and at the end of}} the year Spain had lost most of its gains. For the campaign of 1637 Olivares planned a renewed offensive against France. In Brussels the Cardinal-Infante actually would have preferred an offensive against the Dutch, but reluctantly agreed to take part in the three-pronged invasion of France that summer (the other invasions would come from Catalonia and Lombardy). He therefore started to mass his forces on the French border when word came that the Dutch <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> invested the city of Breda with a besieging army of 18,000.|$|E
25|$|Opinions have {{differed}} as to {{the precise}} mechanism by which water had built up in such quantity and then <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> been released with such devastating consequences. For many years the accepted explanation was that proposed by Joseph Vallot. It was believed that meltwater had drained through the glacier and become trapped as an intraglacial cavity, i.e. as an underground lake within a crevasse which itself had then become enlarged and widened by the water. However, recent re-analysis of historic photographs, accounts and contemporary meteorological precipitation data and field measurements, including radar analysis and magnetic resonance imaging, has presented an alternative and more plausible mechanism in which meltwater collected {{much closer to the}} surface (as a supraglacial lake) in a period when the glacier had a negative mass balance (i.e. was experiencing year-on-year melting and retreat). Prior to 1878 the glacier would not have been well-visited, so any surface lake could have gone unnoticed, and after 1878 the glacier experienced a positive mass balance (i.e. year-on-year accumulation of snow and ice) which would have hidden the lake from view until the eventual outburst flood in 1892.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of the crusade, John {{travelled}} throughout Europe seeking assistance, but found support only from Frederick, who then married John and Maria's daughter Isabella II in 1225. The next year, Isabella died giving birth to their son Conrad IV, who succeeded his mother to the throne although he never appeared in the east. Frederick had reneged on his promise to lead the Fifth Crusade, but was now eager to cement his claim to the throne through Conrad. There were also plans to join with al-Kamil in attacking al-Mu'azzam in Damascus, an alliance which had been discussed with Egyptian envoys in Italy. But after continually delaying his departure for the Holy Land, including suffering an outbreak of disease in his fleet, he was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX in 1227. The crusaders, led not by Frederick but by his representatives Richard Filangieri, Henry IV, Duke of Limburg, and Hermann of Salza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, arrived in the east late in 1227, and while waiting for the emperor they set about refortifying Sidon, where they built the sea castle, and Montfort, which later became the headquarters of the Teutonic Knights. The Ayyubids of Damascus did not dare attack, as al-Mu'azzam <b>had</b> <b>suddenly</b> died not long before. Frederick finally arrived on the Sixth Crusade in September 1228, and claimed the regency of the kingdom in the name of his infant son.|$|E
