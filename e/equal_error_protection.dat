40|$|Abstract—In this correspondence, a {{generalization}} of rateless codes is proposed. The proposed codes provide unequal <b>error</b> <b>protection</b> (UEP). The asymptotic properties of these codes under the iterative decoding are investigated. Moreover, {{upper and lower}} bounds on maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding error probabilities of finite-length LT and Raptor codes for both <b>equal</b> and unequal <b>error</b> <b>protection</b> schemes are derived. Further, our work is verified with simulations. Simulation results indicate that the proposed codes provide desirable UEP. We also note that the UEP property does not impose a considerable drawback on the overall performance of the codes. Moreover, we discuss that the proposed codes can provide unequal recovery time (URT). This means that given a target bit error rate, different parts of information bits can be decoded after receiving different amounts of encoded bits. This implies that the information bits can be recovered in a progressive manner. This URT property may be used for sequential data recovery in video/audio streaming.

For error-resilience, an additional bitstream generated by Wyner-Ziv encoding of the video signal is transmitted. In the event of channel errors, the Wyner-Ziv description is decoded using the error-prone systematic description as side-information. In the second scheme, the video bitstream is partitioned into two or more layers, and each layer is assigned different amounts of parity information depending upon its relative significance. Since the base layer has heavy protection, a certain minimum video quality is guaranteed at the receiver.
