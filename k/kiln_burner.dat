40|$|Solid {{hazardous}} waste mixed with wood chips (SHW) is a partly CO 2 neutral fuel, and hence {{is a good}} candidate for substituting fossil fuels like pulverized coal in rotary kiln burners used in cement kiln systems. SHW is used in several cement plants, but the optimum substitution rate has apparently not yet been fully investigated. The present study aims to find the maximum possible replacement of coal by SHW, without negatively affecting the product quality, emissions and overall operation of the process. A full-scale experiment was carried out in the rotary <b>kiln</b> <b>burner</b> of a cement plant by varying the SHW substitution rate from 0 to 3 t/hr. Clinker quality, emissions and other relevant operational data from the experiment were analysed using fuel characteristics of coal and SHW. The results revealed that SHW could safely replace around 20 % of the primary coal energy without giving negative effects. The limiting factor is the free lime content of the clinker. Results from the present study were also compared with results from a previous test using meat and bone meal...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to find the}} maximum {{possible}} replacement of coal by combined feeding of plastic waste and solid hazardous waste mixed with wood chips (SHW) in rotary kiln burners used in cement kiln systems. The coal replacement should be achieved without negative impacts on product quality, emissions or overall operation of the process. A full-scale experiment {{was carried out in}} the rotary <b>kiln</b> <b>burner</b> of a cement kiln by varying SHW and plastic waste feeding rates. Experimental results were analysed using fuel characteristics of coal, SHW and plastic waste. The results revealed that feeding 3 t/hr of SHW plus 2. 5 t/hr of plastic waste was acceptable, although giving a slightly lower production rate. This waste feeding rate is equivalent to 52 % of coal energy replacement in the main burner. The limiting factor is the free lime content of the clinker. A comparable result for the reduction in production rate could be found from a simulation using a mathematical model of the kiln. Results from the present study were also compared with results from two previous studies, in which SHW and meat and bone meal were the solid alternative fuels used...|$|E
40|$|<b>Kiln</b> <b>burners</b> for {{industrial}} tile production are usually fuelled by methane gas. However, the interest towards {{the use of}} coal or synthesis gases is rapidly increasing, mainly due {{to the opening of}} important markets in developing countries. The widely variable chemical composition of these fuels demands the gas burner to be adapted on case-by-case basis, since the firing parameters are strictly fixed, to guarantee the required temperature distribution within the kiln. In this context, computational fluid dynamics analysis represents a very convenient alternative to the traditional design based on experiments. In this article three-dimensional numerical predictions are presented for a syngas-fired burner. Three different fuels, two burner layouts and two burner nominal power are considered. Temperature, velocity and oxygen mass fraction distributions are discussed, and general design lines for low lower heating value gas burners are extracted...|$|R
40|$|Rotary cement kilns {{are widely}} used to convert calcineous raw meal into cement clinker, and are key {{components}} in the cement industry. In this article, we report a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based model to capture key transport processes in rotary cement kilns. Separate but coupled computational models were developed for the bed and the freeboard regions of the rotary kiln. The complex swirling airflow produced by <b>kiln</b> <b>burners,</b> coal combustion, gas-phase combustion of volatile matter and radiative heat transfer in the freeboard region were modeled. The clinkerization reactions in the bed region were modeled assuming solids as pseudo fluids. Coating formation in cement kilns (for both bed and freeboard regions) was considered. Appropriate source and sink terms were developed to model transfer of CO(2) from the bed to the freeboard region due to calcination reaction in the bed region. The developed bed and freeboard models were coupled by mass and energy communication through common interface. These coupled computational models were able to quite satisfactorily predict the available data from industrial kilns and previously published results. The computational models were also able to capture {{the intricacies of the}} burning zones of rotary cement kilns for changing burner-operational parameters like axial to swirl ratio and oxygen enrichment. The developed approach, computational models and simulation results will not only help in developing better understanding of cement kilns but also provide quantitative information about influence of burner design and other design parameters on kiln performance.

40|$|Typical {{oxidation}} {{process of}} tungsten scraps was modified by the rotary <b>kiln</b> with oxygen <b>burner</b> {{to increase the}} oxidation rate of tungsten scraps. Also to accelerate the solubility of solid oxidized products, the hydrothermal reflux method was adapted. By heating tungsten scraps in rotary <b>kiln</b> with oxygen <b>burner</b> at around 900 ° for 2 hrs, the scraps was oxidized completely. Then oxidized products (WO 3 and CoWO 4) was fully dissolved in the solution of NaOH by hydrothermal reflux method at 150 ° for 2 hrs. The dissolution rate of oxidized products was increased with increasing the reaction temperature and concentration of NaOH. And then CaWO 4 and H 2 WO 4 could be generated from the aqueous sodium tungstate solution. Ammonium paratungstate (APT) also could be produced from tungstic acid using by aqueous ammonium solution. The morphologies (cubic and plate types) of APT was controlled by the stirring process of purified solution of ammonium paratungstate...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this master thesis {{have been to}} model and simulate oxy-combustion CO 2 capture in a cement plant. The model developed is a process simulation of the calcination process with varying degree of air in-leakage, where heat is supplied by combustion in an oxygen rich environment, followed by capture of the CO 2. The further gas separation after H 2 O condensation to achieve the required CO 2 quality was evaluated. In addition to the process simulations, a review of literature related to oxy-combustion CO 2 capture and cement production was performed, and an engineering evaluation of the necessary modifications to the cement plant conducted. A simulation model was built in Aspen HYSYS, and student Jelmer de Winter s project work was utilized as a starting point. The model was developed with the aim to achieve results comparable to a process model constructed by the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) in 2009. The goal was to capture {{as much of the}} CO 2 as possible, and to achieve a CO 2 purity of minimum 95 mol-% after the CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). CO 2 purity in the dry flue gas of ~ 85 mol % was achieved, with a CO 2 capture rate up to 96. 4 %. Five different air in-leakages (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % of total flue gas flow) were tested. The results showed that the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas decreased with increasing degree of air in-leakage. The decrease in CO 2 concentration causes an increase of the power consumption of the CO 2 CPU of ~ 2. 6 % per percentage point of air in-leakage, and the CO 2 capture rate was also reduced when the air in-leakage increased. These results agree well with results from previous oxy-combustion studies, and show the importance of minimizing air in-leakages in the cement plant. If oxy-combustion capture is to be utilized at a cement plant, some process modifications and additional equipment is required. An Air Separation Unit (ASU) is needed to provide almost pure oxygen for the combustion process. A Compression and Purification Unit (CPU) is also required, in order achieve the necessary CO 2 purity and transport conditions. When using oxy-combustion technology, both the material conversion in the cement kiln system and the operational specifications of the overall process are different from those in conventional kiln operation. However, research made by ECRA in 2012 showed that the negative impacts of oxy-combustion on the product quality seem to be negligible. Other necessary process modifications when retrofitting with oxy-combustion are news design of the <b>kiln</b> <b>burner</b> and the clinker cooler in the cement plant. In addition, prevention of excessive air in-leakage by improving sealing locations at the cement plant is necessary, as the simulation results show. This is possible e. g. by waste gas flushed systems, or by an improved maintenance of inspection doors and similar devices. The CPU is up to a certain point capable of handling changes in the flue gas composition at short-term inspections; however it limits its efficiency...|$|E
50|$|Even {{in ancient}} times, {{charcoal}} was manufactured in kilns. Logs were {{arranged in a}} conical heap (a charcoal kiln or pile) around posts, a fire shaft was made using brushwood and wood chips and covered with an airtight layer of grass, moss and earth. The pile was ignited inside the fire shaft and, at a temperature of between 300 and 350 °C, the carbonization process began. The process took six to eight days - in large kilns several weeks - during which time the charcoal burner had to control the draught (by piercing small holes and resealing them), being careful neither to allow the pile to go out nor let it go up in flames. By observing the smoke exiting the <b>kiln,</b> the charcoal <b>burner</b> could assess {{the state of the}} carbonization process. If the smoke was thick and gray, the wood was still raw; thin, blue smoke indicated good carbonization.|$|R
40|$|Annular shaft <b>kilns</b> with {{opposite}} <b>burners</b> (OBASK) {{has been}} widely adopted due to the advantages of cost saving and easy controlling. Nonetheless, compared with the traditional annular shaft kiln, the OBASK is not favorable in terms of thermal performance and energy efficiency. Aiming to improve the thermal performance, a comprehensive energy and exergy analysis of an OBASK has been conducted based on the actual operational data obtained from on-site measurements. For making a thorough thermal analysis of the OBASK, special attentions have been focused in considering magnesium decomposition reaction and moisture in limestone in the methodology. The energy and exergy efficiencies are determined to be 63. 6 % and 35. 7 %, respectively. The exergy destruction is 44. 0 % of total exergy input of which fuel combustion causes 56. 6 % of the exergy destruction. Furthermore, the effects of CaO and moisture contents in limestone on energy and exergy efficiencies are analyzed. The results have demonstrated the potential energy saving of the OBASK and identified three proposed energy conservation measures. Improvement and effect of the three proposed measures on the thermal performance are verified via further analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of modifying a jet's exit flow pattern {{on both the}} near and far-field turbulent mixing processes and on the resulting combustion performance, is explored. This reveals that, in contradiction to some common assumptions, increasing the coherence of large-scale motions can decrease molecular mixing rates, and yet can still be beneficial in some applications. Even relatively {{minor changes to the}} exit flow pattern of a non-reacting round jet, through changes to the nozzle profile are found to propagate downstream into the far field, apparently through the underlying turbulent structure. Importantly, while a jet from a smoothly contracting nozzle is found to have higher rates of entrainment, mean spread and mean decay of the scalar field than does a long pipe jet, it has a lower rate of molecular mixing. That is, increased large-scale mixing does not necessarily result in increased fine-scale mixing. A range of devices are reviewed which enhance, or stimulate the large-scale, coherent motions in an emerging jet using acoustic, mechanical or fluidic methods. The available evidence suggests that those methods which induce instantaneously asymmetric flow structure are more effective at increasing the near-field spreading than are those which induce instantaneously axisymmetric flow structure. Only limited data are available of the effects of such near-field changes on the far-field properties. Nevertheless, the available data reveal a clear trend that this near-field flow undergoes a transition to a far-field state whose spread and decay is comparable with that of a steady jet, albeit being indelibly altered by the near-field excitation. It also suggests that “self-exciting” devices (i. e. that are not externally forced), cause a net reduction in the total entrainment relative to the unexcited jet, due to the losses induced by the device itself. Nevertheless, the changes which they can impart to the flow, such as redistributing the turbulent energy from the fine to the larger scales, can be beneficial for combustion in applications where high radiant heat transfer is desirable. Precessing and flapping jets are found to cause an increase in flame volume relative to an equivalent simple jet (SJ), implying lower molecular mixing rates. However, importantly, this decrease in mixing is achieved with no increase in the flame length. Rather the width to length ratio of these flames is increased significantly. This is of practical significance because the length of a flame is often the limiting dimension in industrial systems. The reduced strain-rates lead to an increased presence of soot within the flame, while not, in general, significantly influencing the emission of soot from the flame. The increased volume of soot leads to increased radiation, which in turn acts to reduce flame temperature, so lowering thermal NOx emissions through a global residence time–temperature reduction. For example, in full-scale cement <b>kilns</b> these <b>burner</b> nozzles are found to reduce NOx emissions by around 40 – 60 % and increase fuel efficiency (or output) by around 5 – 10 %. G. J.
