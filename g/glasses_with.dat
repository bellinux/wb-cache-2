25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> large, plastic frames were in fashion for both men and women. Small metal framed {{eyeglasses}} made a return to fashion in 1984 and 1985, and in the late 1980s, <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> tortoise-shell coloring became popular. These were smaller and rounder than the type that was popular earlier in the decade. Throughout the 1980s, Ray-Ban Wayfarers were extremely popular, as worn by Tom Cruise in the 1983 movie Risky Business.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} {{identification of}} organic bodies by their optical properties was treated in 1864; and later, {{in conjunction with}} the Rev. William Vernon Harcourt, he investigated the relation between the chemical composition and the optical properties of various <b>glasses,</b> <b>with</b> reference to the conditions of transparency and the improvement of achromatic telescopes. A still later paper connected with the construction of optical instruments discussed the theoretical limits to the aperture of microscope objectives.|$|E
25|$|A glass solder is used, e.g., {{for joining}} {{together}} parts of cathode ray tubes and plasma display panels. Newer compositions lowered the usage temperature from 450 to 390°C {{by reducing the}} lead(II) oxide content down from 70%, increasing the zinc oxide content, adding titanium dioxide and bismuth(III) oxide and some other components. The high thermal expansion of such glass can be reduced by a suitable ceramic filler. Lead-free solder <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> soldering temperature of 450°C were also developed.|$|E
25|$|Other celebrities {{have used}} glasses to {{differentiate}} {{themselves from the}} characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> thick plastic frames like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to Steve Urkel.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} to mid 1980s, post-punk and new wave music groups {{influenced}} mainstream male and female fashion. Commercially made slim-fitting suits, thin neckties in leather or bold patterns, striped T-shirts, Members Only jackets, clubwear, metallic fabric shirts, cat eye glasses, horn rim <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> brightly colored frames, androgynous neon colored makeup, and pristine leather jackets were widely worn. Common hairstyles included a short quiff for men, or teased big hair for women, and typical unisex colors for clothing included turquoise, teal, red, neon yellow and purple.|$|E
25|$|Ever since glass {{containers}} have existed, specialised glasses {{for each}} type of wine were created. So many glasses, specific to white wine, exist in many wine producing regions. The glass must be perfectly clear and colourless to properly appreciate the colour of the wine. However, designers and manufacturers of tableware have created white wine <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> green or blue feet. These colours flatter the wine – they give an artificial colour in the shade (a reflection barrier which emphasizes the separation between the glass and the wine) – rejuvenating the perceived impression.|$|E
25|$|Yellow tinted {{glasses are}} {{a type of}} <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of {{reducing}} headaches {{due to lack of}} blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses. Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain. These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames. Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration.|$|E

25|$|<b>Glasses</b> <b>with</b> {{lead oxide}} content first {{appeared}} in Mesopotamia, {{the birthplace of the}} glass industry. The earliest known example is a blue glass fragment from Nippur dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO. Glass is mentioned in clay tablets from the reign of Assurbanipal (668–631 BC), and a recipe for lead glaze appears in a Babylonian tablet of 1700 BC. A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at Nimrud, from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that lead oxide may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was {{produced}} for Children in Need, featuring {{all of the}} surviving actors who played the Doctor {{and a number of}} previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.|$|E
25|$|Vertical glass tubes, {{known as}} water gauges or water glasses, show {{the level of}} water in the boiler and are {{carefully}} monitored at all times while the boiler is being fired. Before the 1870s it was more common to have a series of try-cocks fitted to the boiler within reach of the crew; each try cock (at least two and usually three were fitted) was mounted at a different level. By opening each try-cock and seeing if steam or water vented through it, the level {{of water in the}} boiler could be estimated with limited accuracy. As boiler pressures increased the use of try-cocks became increasingly dangerous and the valves were prone to blockage with scale or sediment, giving false readings. This led to their replacement with the sight glass. As with the injectors, two <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> separate fittings were usually installed to provide independent readings.|$|E

25|$|Glass solders are {{available}} as frit powder with grain size below 60 micrometers. They can be mixed with water or alcohol {{to form a}} paste for easy application, or with dissolved nitrocellulose or other suitable binder for adhering to the surfaces until being melted. The eventual binder has to be burned off before melting proceeds, requiring careful firing regime. The solder glass can be also applied from molten state {{to the area of}} the future joint during manufacture of the part. Due to their low viscosity in molten state, lead <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> high PbO content (often 70–85%) are frequently used. The most common compositions are based on lead borates (leaded borate glass or borosilicate glass). Smaller amount of zinc oxide or aluminium oxide can be added for increasing chemical stability. Phosphate glasses can be also employed. Zinc oxide, bismuth trioxide, and copper(II) oxide can be added for influencing the thermal expansion; unlike the alkali oxides, these lower the softening point without increasing of thermal expansion.|$|E
25|$|In {{a totally}} {{different}} sense, polarization encoding has become the leading (but not sole) method for delivering separate images {{to the left and}} right eye in stereoscopic displays used for 3D movies. This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). Polarized 3D <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from RealD. Projecting such images requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as silver screens); a normal diffuse white projection screen causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.|$|E
500|$|U2 3D was {{slated to}} be {{screened}} only in IMAX theaters, but the large {{increase in the number}} of digital 3D theaters following post-production prompted the filmmakers to expand the release to include those cinemas. Two different types of polarized 3D glasses were used for the IMAX 3D and digital 3D showings. The IMAX 3D version of the film used <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> one lens polarized horizontally and one polarized vertically, while the digital 3D version used <b>glasses</b> <b>with</b> two circularly polarized lenses. John Modell described the IMAX version as a [...] "more immersive experience", and stated that the digital 3D version features more vivid colors.|$|E
