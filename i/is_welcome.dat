Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.|$|E
5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime <b>is</b> <b>Welcome</b> to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, Adult Swim has {{frequently}} aired adult animation features, anime, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, live-action, and pilots. Shows may have sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence; in other words, programs {{that would be}} deemed inappropriate if aired during the day on Cartoon Network, when children would be watching. While the network features comedic and dramatic programs of all types, many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Thus, Adult Swim has {{become a source of}} conflict, with some saying that it is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that <b>is</b> <b>welcome.</b> Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} sources of income are fishery and trade. As {{one of the most}} {{important}} coastal towns in the near surroundings El Jebha has an own harbour where many fisher boats, large and small, are anchored. Furthermore, the harbour <b>is</b> <b>welcome</b> and useful for many Europeans who are passing through the area in a tour around the Mediterranean sea. Next to the fishery there is also a booming culture of commerce and trade. The administrative function and the harbour of El Jebha are the two main reasons for most people to consider a visit, which in turn makes residents decide to engage in trade and commerce. Also, the location of El Jebha across the coastal route adds to its popularity as a centre of the district Mtiwa.|$|E

Since the number of countries playing bandy is not large, every country which can set up a team <b>is</b> <b>welcome</b> {{to take part in}} the World Championship. The quality of the teams varies, however, with only six nations, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Russia, Finland, Norway, and Kazakhstan, having won medals (allowing for the fact that Russia's team took over from the Soviet Union in 1993). Finland won the 2004 world championship in Västerås, Sweden, while all other championships have been won by Sweden, the Soviet Union and Russia.|$|E

This festival is held from about August 2–7 every year. This event attracts millions of visitors.

25|$|Pre-session Strategy {{refers to}} the leader’s ability to {{understand}} the importance of small talk just prior to group discussion. The facilitator must cordially greet the group members and begin small talk {{while at the same time}} avoid the topics and issues that will be discussed during the sessions. This will allow the group leader to observe the kind of interactions and understand which participant has what qualities. Recording is beneficial for the leader via tape recording and note taking. Note taking is useful as they can be utilized even if the tape recorder stops working. Someone other than the group leader or the facilitator should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion. Beginning of the Discussion includes the usual pattern of discussion which <b>is</b> <b>welcome,</b> overview and topic, ground rules and first question. The overview must provide an explanation of the purpose and importance of the topic of discussion. Ground rules must be stated explicitly. Some of the examples are, minimizing or eliminating side conversations, one person talks at a time, no criticizing what others have to say and treating everyone’s opinion with respect and dignity. The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E
