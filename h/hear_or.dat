5|$|In 1625, James VI {{died and}} was succeeded {{by his son}} Charles I. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his {{northern}} kingdom, with his first visit being for his Scottish coronation in 1633, when he was crowned in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh with full Anglican rites. Charles had relatively few important Scots in his circle and relied heavily in Scottish matters on the generally mistrusted and often indecisive James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and the bishops, particularly John Spottiswood, Archbishop of St. Andrews, eventually making him chancellor. At {{the beginning of his}} reign, Charles' revocation of alienated lands since 1542 helped secure the finances of the kirk, but it threatened the holdings of the nobility who had gained from the Reformation settlement. His pushing through of legislation and refusal to <b>hear</b> (<b>or</b> legal pursuit of) those raising objections, created further resentment among the nobility. In England his religious policies caused similar resentment and he ruled without calling a parliament from 1629.|$|E
5|$|Penny finds Meredith {{and calls}} for help. The doctors rush to save Meredith's life, {{in the face of}} her injuries. As Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew), Ben, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), Owen, Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) address the injuries, Meredith realizes she is unable to speak. They soon {{discover}} that she's lost her hearing {{as a result of the}} beating she endured. The episode then draws into silence as it is shown from Meredith's perspective, who is unable to <b>hear,</b> <b>or</b> speak. Her jaw is wired shut and she relies on her other senses to interpret the situation.|$|E

25|$|Research into moose {{predation}} {{suggests that}} {{their response to}} perceived threats is learned rather than instinctual. In practical terms this means moose are more vulnerable in areas where wolf or bear populations were decimated {{in the past but}} are now rebounding. These same studies suggest, however, that moose learn quickly and adapt, fleeing an area if they <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> smell wolves, bears, or scavenger birds such as ravens.|$|E
25|$|To be successful, a beaver dam pipe must {{eliminate}} {{the sound and}} feel of water flowing into the pipe. Successful pipe designs (e.g. Flexible Pond Leveler, Castor Master, Clemson Pond Leveler) achieve this by protecting the intake end of the pipe with a cylindrical fence enclosure. A beaver swimming along {{the outside of the}} fence enclosure is unable to <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> feel the flow of water into the pipe and cannot reach it to block it.|$|E

25|$|When readers {{process a}} local ambiguity, they settle {{on one of}} the {{possible}} interpretations immediately without waiting to <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> read more words that might help decide which interpretation is correct (the behaviour is called incremental processing). If readers are surprised by the turn the sentence really takes, processing is slowed and is visible for example in reading times. Locally-ambiguous sentences have, therefore, been used as test cases to investigate the influence of a number of different factors on human sentence processing. If a factor helps readers to avoid difficulty, {{it is clear that the}} factor plays a factor in sentence processing.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>hearing</b> <b>or</b> <b>hearing</b> person, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of mainstream English-language culture, refers to someone whose sense of hearing is at the medical norm. From this point of view, someone who is not fully hearing has a <b>hearing</b> loss <b>or</b> is said to be hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>or</b> deaf. The continuum of hearing ability tends to be broken down into fine gradations. Moving down the scale and further away from the medical norm, people are classed as hearing, then slightly hard of hearing, moderately hard of hearing, severely hard of hearing, and finally deaf (severely deaf or profoundly deaf for those furthest from the norm).|$|R

25|$|Another {{potential}} {{factor that}} led to the crash of the 737 aircraft was the power control unit (PCU) that controlled the aircraft's rudder. The cause of some 737 crashes such as USAir Flight 427 had been attributed to the 737's rudder issues. Although the NTSB and PCU manufacturer Parker Hannifin had already determined that the PCU was properly working, and thus not the cause of the crash, a private investigation into the crash for a civil lawsuit tried by jury in a California state court in Los Angeles, which was not allowed to <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> consider the NTSB's and Parker Hannifin's conclusions, decided that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve inside the PCU, based on forensic findings from an electron microscope which determined that minute defects within the PCU had caused the rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable flight and crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft's rudder controls and the families later reached an out-of-court settlement.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{standard}} enemies {{from among the}} game's antagonistic force, the party can also battle Mira's indigenous wildlife. While some creatures are docile until attacked, others will attack if they <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> see you. Upon entering battle, each character attacks with their assigned automatically to a set rhythm based on their assigned weapons; each character has health points (HP) and Tension points (TP), and a morale gauge which determines their effectiveness in battle. Attack strength varies depending on a party member's position upon attacking. Healing the party in-battle {{can be done with}} types of Arts, but is mainly done using a quick-time event (QTE) tied to the Soul Voice system, a line-up of commands which trigger a Soul Challenge QTE, healing the party or granting positive effects. Successfully completing a Soul Challenge raises the party's morale. If a battle is successfully completed, knocked-out party members will revive and the party will recover HP. If the avatar is knocked out, they can either teleport to a safe location or wait and be revived if the other party members defeated all engaged enemies within thirty seconds.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead found touring {{stressful}} {{and took}} a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of The Bends. Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was {{an awful lot of}} soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive things that I <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it." ...|$|E
500|$|Marsh {{thought the}} problem with the album's {{narrative}} is that there isn't enough transitional material provided by the lyrics.

Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> see in [...] "1921", how or why he plays pinball, why [...] "Smash the Mirror" [...] leads into [...] "I overwhelm as I approach you" [...] (the opening line in [...] "Sensation"), why Tommy tells his followers in [...] "We're Not Gonna Take It" [...] they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the [...] "you" [...] is in [...] "Listening to you, I get the music".|$|E

Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. [...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He shows us that there really is something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change.|$|E
500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "Slaughter", Ndegéocello tried to weave {{together}} sonic influences from the producers Trevor Horn and RZA, {{as well as}} the bands Yes, Sade, and The Human League: [...] "That's what I tried to achieve in this particular recording: some sonic tapestries that people, even if they're not listening to the lyrics, could just feel or <b>hear,</b> <b>or</b> just have a deep, inner dialogue with." [...] She covered Ready for the World's 1986 song [...] "Love You Down", deconstructing it into what Village Voice critic Eugene Holley Jr. described as [...] "a stripper's classic". Songs such as [...] "Mass Transit" [...] and [...] "White Girl" [...] featured Ndegéocello's characteristic ska and reggae influenced basslines; Holley argued that Caribbean riddims and country-rock guitar grooves underpinned the music, serving as a backdrop for Ndegéocello's contralto singing throughout Devil's Halo. In the opinion of Ed Potton from The Times, her voice [...] "resided somewhere between Sade and PJ Harvey".|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{also cited}} the flight {{engineer}} {{for failing to}} calculate the [...] "minimum approach/landing fuel quantity." [...] The report references the 360° turn that the flight was ordered to make at 20:54 {{as evidence that the}} crew should have known that they were being treated routinely and not given any emergency priority. Instead, the CVR revealed that the flight crew was convinced that they were being given priority. Additionally, the NTSB criticized the first officer for failing to use the word [...] "emergency" [...] as the captain had insisted he do. Compounded with the apparent inability of the captain to <b>hear</b> <b>or</b> understand the radio communications, the NTSB called the situation a [...] "total breakdown in communications by the flightcrew." [...] Summarizing, the investigators cited [...] "the flightcrew's failure to notify ATC of their fuel situation while holding at CAMRN in order to ensure arrival at the approach fix with an adequate approach minimum fuel level and a breakdown in communications between the flightcrew and ATC, and among the flight crewmembers" [...] as the two main factors that led to the crash.|$|E
