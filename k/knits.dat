25|$|Warp <b>knits</b> do not stretch {{as much as}} a weft knit, and it is run-resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but {{stretches}} more. This {{is especially}} true if spools of spandex are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more flexibility and making it less prone to having a 'baggy' appearance. The average t-shirt is a weft knit.|$|E
25|$|While most crochet is {{made with}} a hook, {{there is also a}} method of {{crocheting}} with a knitting loom. This is called loomchet. Slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with <b>knits,</b> purls, and cables, and get a similar result.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{wrinkles}} and other problems, the fabric must be stabilized. The method of stabilizing {{depends on the}} type of machine, the fabric type, and the design density. For example, <b>knits</b> and large designs typically require firm stabilization. There are many methods for stabilizing fabric, but most often one or more additional pieces of material called stabilizers or interfacing are added beneath or on top of the fabric, or both. Stabilizer types include cut-away, tear-away, solvy water-soluble, heat-n-gone, filmoplast, and open mesh, sometimes in various combinations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{very simple}} cases, <b>knitting</b> {{can be done}} without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, <b>knitting</b> is usually carried out using tools such as <b>knitting</b> needles, <b>knitting</b> {{machines}} or rigid frames. [...] Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, <b>knitting</b> boards, <b>knitting</b> rings (also called <b>knitting</b> looms) or <b>knitting</b> spools (also known as <b>knitting</b> knobbies, <b>knitting</b> nancies, or corkers). [...] There is also a technique called knooking of <b>knitting</b> with a crochet hook that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they're being worked. Other tools are used to prepare yarn for <b>knitting,</b> to measure and design <b>knitted</b> garments, or to make <b>knitting</b> easier or more comfortable.|$|R
50|$|Circular <b>knitting</b> or <b>knitting</b> in {{the round}} {{is a form of}} <b>knitting</b> that creates a {{seamless}} tube. When <b>knitting</b> circularly, the <b>knitting</b> is cast on and the circle of stitches is joined. <b>Knitting</b> is worked in rounds (the equivalent of rows in flat <b>knitting)</b> in a spiral. Originally, circular <b>knitting</b> was done using a set of four or five double-pointed needles. Later, circular needles were invented, which {{can also be used to}} <b>knit</b> {{in the round}}: the circular needle looks like two short <b>knitting</b> needles connected by a cable between them.|$|R
50|$|I <b>Knit</b> London (often {{shortened}} to I <b>Knit</b> or IKL) is a <b>knitting</b> organisation {{based in}} London, England, UK, comprising a <b>knitting</b> group, <b>knitting</b> shop and <b>knitting</b> events.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of <b>knits</b> such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella <b>knits</b> together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E

Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, [...] "the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself." [...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... these shoes aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense."

[...] Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of The New York Times differed and said, [...] "If ever there was a reason for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani's fashion meltdown." ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Walker {{authored}} several {{volumes of}} <b>knitting</b> references {{which have become}} landmarks for their comprehensiveness and clarity.

500|$|As a continuation, [...] "Red Dead Redemption elegiac tone <b>knits</b> {{incredibly}} {{well with}} [...] arch Gothic horror", wrote Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer). Critics found the expansion's story {{to be much}} more lighthearted in comparison to the main game, with a different overall feel. IGN marked the title's exaggerated theatricality and overtones of horror B movie panache. At the time, zombies were a recurring motif in video games. Whitehead added that Rockstar's ability to use the [...] "most played-out and over-exposed cultural meme" [...] in their [...] "epic Western" [...] without the product appearing silly or gimmicky was a testament to their design acumen. For instance, a talk with Sasquatch was both absurd and poignant. The expansion's script, he wrote, understood the spirit of its characters and balanced sardonicism and honest pathos. Whitehead felt that its nuanced treatment of Marston made him [...] "one of gaming's great characters". On the other hand, Whitehead considered the expansion's mission design lackluster and complained of too many quests in which the player fetches items for other people and traveling between points only to initiate cutscenes. GameSpot praised the story's humor but felt that it was less interesting and varied compared to the main game. Reviewers recommended finishing the base game before starting the downloadable content, not for spoilers but {{to make the most of}} the game's references to the original story.|$|E

2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and <b>knits</b> straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and <b>knits</b> or purls back the other way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} <b>knitting</b> has three basic tasks: (1) the active (unsecured) {{stitches}} {{must be held}} so they don't drop; (2) these stitches must be released sometime after they are secured; and (3) new bights of yarn must be passed through the fabric, usually through active stitches, thus securing them. In very simple cases, <b>knitting</b> can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, hand-knitting is usually carried out using tools such as <b>knitting</b> needles or rigid frames. Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called <b>knitting</b> boards, <b>knitting</b> rings (also called <b>knitting</b> looms) or <b>knitting</b> spools (also known as <b>knitting</b> knobbies, <b>knitting</b> nancies, or corkers). Other tools are used to prepare yarn for <b>knitting,</b> to measure and design <b>knitted</b> garments, or to make <b>knitting</b> easier or more comfortable.|$|R

There, the Old Woman's children are depicted as scampering mice, and their mother as a mouse whipping her children in a shoe in the background. In Appley Dapply however, the author speculates upon {{the identity of the}} old woman in two stanzas, believing she was a mouse due to being able to live in a shoe. In the first illustration, the mouse and her children tumble from an elaborately beaded turquoise-blue shoe, and, in the illustration accompanying the second stanza, the mouse <b>knits</b> peacefully [...] presumably while the children are in bed.|$|E
50|$|Arm <b>knitting</b> is a <b>knitting</b> {{technique}} {{which uses}} the knitter's arms instead of <b>knitting</b> needles. This method of <b>knitting</b> gained popularity during 2013 and 2014.|$|R

25|$|Domestic <b>knitting</b> {{machines}} use the weft <b>knitting</b> method {{which produces}} a fabric similar to hand <b>knitting.</b> <b>Knitting</b> proceeds {{more quickly than}} in hand <b>knitting,</b> where (usually two) straight needles are held in the hand and each stitch is manipulated individually across the row. <b>Knitting</b> machines work an entire row of loops in a single movement.|$|R
2500|$|Not every stitch {{in a row}} need be knitted; {{some may}} be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a {{subsequent}} row. This is known as slip-stitch knitting. [...] The slipped stitches are naturally longer than the knitted ones. For example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts. [...] This can produce interesting visual effects, although the resulting fabric is more rigid because the slipped stitch 'pulls' on its neighbours and is less deformable. Mosaic knitting {{is a form of}} slip-stitch knitting that <b>knits</b> alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as Fair-Isle knitting.|$|E
2500|$|Nyrop {{writes that}} the most common example is the [...] "intense feeling which <b>knits</b> parents to their offspring", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between {{other members of the}} same family, which can include those outside the {{immediate}} family circle, [...] "everywhere where deep affection unites people." [...] The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and when Moses went to meet his father-in-law, he [...] "did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent" [...] (Exodus 18:7); and when Jacob had wrestled with the Lord he met Esau, ran towards him, fell on his neck and kissed him. The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early Greeks, as when Odysseus, on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.|$|E
2500|$|With Raiul găinilor, Lungu's {{extends his}} focus on the provincial and {{suburban}} environments into novel form. The book, written over one summer, carries the subtitle [...] "A faux novel of rumors and mysteries" [...] and is defined by its author as a work on [...] "the circulations of rumors". Its heroes are feeble {{men and women who}} interpret the larger world based on things that occur in their immediate vicinity, Acacia Street. The narrative borrows from the conventions of the frame story, and, Terian notes, owes direct inspiration to Hanu Ancuței, an interwar volume by the classic Romanian author Mihail Sadoveanu. While Terian believes Raiul găinilor to be primarily calm and distant, his colleague Mircea Iorgulescu, who prefaced the work, argued: [...] "Under a benign and slow-going appearance, the novel's world is actually terrifying. It lives mechanically, though automatisms which provide it with a kind of demented functioning, similar to one of the characters, a woman who endlessly <b>knits</b> pullovers without watching her own hands." [...] One fragment which drew critical attention is that in which the humble Milică, who has once been allowed into the house of the reclusive, imposing and envied Colonel, embellishes the account of its luxurious standards in order to captivate his peers. Similarly, the mythomaniacal factory worker Mitu obsesses over his supposed chance encounter with communist leader Ceaușescu. In addition to these topical aspects, the novel fictionalizes professional incompetence, feud, adultery and working class drinking culture. It ultimately deals with the impact of post-Revolution economic transition, reflected in the characters' ambiguous memories of Ponzi schemes, or projected in the account of how the closure of non-lucrative factories prevented the employees from continuing to steal industrial materials. According to Andrei Terian, the book is primarily relevant for the way in the [...] "captivating" [...] and [...] "discreet" [...] narrative supports events of marginal importance, with [...] "the absence of any demonstrative intent" [...] for a defining characteristic. Lungu however recounted having written it with [...] "pleasure, a masochistic pleasure".|$|E
