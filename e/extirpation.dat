5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies {{were included in the}} breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the <b>extirpation</b> of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near <b>extirpation</b> of the anatum in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus {{was heavily}} {{exploited}} by American and European sealers and whalers, {{leading to the}} near <b>extirpation</b> of the Atlantic population. Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples are permitted to kill small numbers {{towards the end of}} each summer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Extirpation</b> {{of prairie}} dogs can also {{contribute}} to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents {{may play a role}} in maintaining healthy forests.|$|E
40|$|Human {{activities}} affect {{even the}} most remote and best preserved places on Earth. One of those places is Dalhousie Springs, Witjira National Park, in the arid centre of Australia. In 2003 we resurveyed the fish communities in springs to document changes since an earlier survey in 1991. Over the 12 years there were 18 population <b>extirpations</b> and only two colonizations, so total occurrences of five native species in 30 springs decreased from 83 to 67 populations. One species, the endemic Dalhousie goby, Chlamydogobius gloveri, accounted for 12 of the 18 population <b>extirpations.</b> Each fish species tended to persist in springs larger than some threshold size. <b>Extirpations</b> were related to spring size, with smaller springs more readily loosing populations, and to major habitat changes, which included large increases in the tropical reed Phragmites and concomitant decreases in open water, disturbed habitats, and dissolved oxygen. <b>Extirpations</b> of fish populations can be attributed primarily to habitat changes associated with reduced disturbance and herbivory {{as a result of}} the removal of feral livestock. These changes highlight the keystone impacts of large mammals on habitats and biotas of desert springs, and should be considered in management practices and policy decisions...|$|R

40|$|Aim Assessing the {{consequences}} of a future increase in non-native species introductions and native species <b>extirpations</b> on taxonomic similarity among fish faunas. Location World-wide. Methods We designed 42 scenarios of future species introductions and <b>extirpations</b> to simulate future fish composition for 1054 river basins. Using these simulated future compositions, we computed the change in taxonomic similarity among pairs of fish faunas from historical to future situation at the river basin, biogeographic realm and world scales. Results According to all our scenarios, taxonomic similarity among fish faunas will strongly increase in the future at the three spatial scales considered. Fish faunas from the Southern Hemisphere, which are currently the less affected by taxonomic homogenization, are forecasted to show the steepest changes. Our scenarios also reveal that non-native species introductions will account for most of the predicted changes, whereas the effect of native species <b>extirpations</b> will be weak. Main conclusions The predicted future taxonomic homogenization will blur the current high level of taxonomic dissimilarity among freshwater fish faunas, and therefore, imperil the conservation programmes based on beta-diversity mapping...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's <b>extirpation</b> {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|There are no snakes in Ireland {{and only}} one species of reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk and the wolf. Some {{previously}} extinct birds, such as the golden eagle, been reintroduced in about the year 2000 after decades of <b>extirpation.</b> Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with oak, pine and birch. Forests today cover about 12.6% of Ireland, of which 4,450km² or one million acres is owned by Coillte, the Republic's forestry service.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local <b>extirpation,</b> and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and The Gambia, where the bird does not occur.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>extirpations</b> {{of animals}} have {{occurred}} in tropical hardwood hammocks. For instance, ten Liguus tree snail varieties have been extirpated within their natural range {{as a result of}} human development and hurricanes (Jones et al. 1981).|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} are causing widespread population declines, but identifying {{how and when}} to intervene remains challenging. Predicting where <b>extirpations</b> are likely to occur and implementing management actions before losses result may be more cost-effective than trying to reestablish lost populations. Early indicators of pressure on populations could be used to make such predictions. Previous work conducted in 2009 and 2010 identified that the presence of Eastern Yellow Robins (Eopsaltria australis) in 42 sites in a fragmented region of eastern Australia was unrelated to woodland extent within 500 m of a site, but the robins’ heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratios (an indicator of chronic stress) were elevated at sites with low levels of surrounding woodland. We resurveyed these 42 sites in 2013 and 2014 for robin presence to determine whether the H:L ratios obtained in 2009 and 2010 predicted the locations of <b>extirpations</b> and whether the previous pattern in H:L ratios was an early sign that woodland extent would become an important predictor of occupancy. We also surveyed for robins at 43 additional sites to determine whether current occupancy could be better predicted by landscape context at a larger scale, relevant to dispersal movements. At the original 42 sites, H:L ratios and <b>extirpations</b> were not related, although only 4 <b>extirpations</b> were observed. Woodland extent within 500 m had become a strong predictor of occupancy. Taken together, these results provide mixed evidence as to whether patterns of individual condition can reveal habitat relationships that become evident as local shifts in occupancy occur but that are not revealed by a single snapshot of species distribution. Across all 85 sites, woodland extent at scales relevant to dispersal (5 km) was not related to occurrence. We recommend that conservation actions focus on regenerating areas of habitat large enough to support robin territories rather than increasing connectivity within the landscape...|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>extirpations</b> {{within the}} Carnivora have {{generally}} followed the human footprint.

5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of <b>extirpation</b> in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the coyote's {{wide range}} and {{abundance}} throughout North America, it {{is listed as}} least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The coyote's pre-Columbian range {{was limited to the}} Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the <b>extirpation</b> of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the United States and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. This expansion is ongoing, and the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).|$|E
5|$|In modern times, bears {{have come}} under {{pressure}} through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American black bear, {{are at risk of}} <b>extirpation</b> in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.|$|E

50|$|Since 1980, {{populations have}} {{collapsed}} throughout their range from disease outbreaks (primarily White band disease), with losses compounded locally by hurricanes, increased predation, bleaching, and other factors. This species is also particularly susceptible to damage from sedimentation and sensitive to temperature and salinity variation. Populations have declined {{by up to}} 98% throughout the range, and localized <b>extirpations</b> have occurred.|$|R
50|$|Trapping is a {{major source}} of American marten {{mortality}} in some populations and may account for up to 90% of all deaths in some areas. Overharvesting has contributed to local <b>extirpations.</b> Trapping may impact population density, sex ratios and age structure. Juveniles are more vulnerable to trapping than adults, and males are more vulnerable than females. American marten are particularly vulnerable to trapping mortality in industrial forests.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk <b>extirpation</b> by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is both the}} {{national}} bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. In the late 20th century {{it was on the}} brink of <b>extirpation</b> in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap, {{interference}} competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities. Coyote ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the <b>extirpation</b> of wolves, while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the coyote population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s, while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the Grand Teton National Park are 33% lower than in {{areas where the}}y are absent. Wolves have been observed to not tolerate coyotes in their vicinity, though coyotes {{have been known to}} trail wolves to feed on their kills.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, due {{to the number of}} {{regional}} <b>extirpations,</b> and under Appendix II by CITES, tightly restricting trade in specimens of the animal. Between 2000 and 2010, the total population declined by 30%. In 1994, some 340 giant anteaters died due to wildfires at Emas National Park in Brazil. The animal is particularly vulnerable to fires due to its slow movement and flammable coat.|$|R
50|$|Snakes are {{commonly}} feared throughout the world. Bounties were paid for dead cobras under the British Raj in India; similarly, {{there have been}} advertised rattlesnake roundups in North America. Data shows that between 1959 and 1986 an average of 5,563 rattlesnakes were killed per year in Sweetwater, Texas, due to rattlesnake roundups, and these roundups have led to documented declines and local <b>extirpations</b> of rattlesnake populations, especially Eastern Diamondbacks in Georgia.|$|R
50|$|An {{analysis}} of the timing of Holarctic megafaunal extinctions and <b>extirpations</b> over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials, periods of abrupt warming, but only when humans were also present. Humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species {{to adapt to the}} climate shift. In at least some areas, interstadials were periods of expanding human populations.|$|R
5|$|Threats to otter {{populations in}} North America vary regionally. Otter inhabitation is {{affected}} by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were prevalent among aquatic habitats {{throughout most of the}} continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries, resulted in extirpations, or declines, in otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide <b>extirpation</b> occurred on Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none of the}} Drosera {{species in}} the United States are federally protected, all are listed as {{threatened}} or endangered in some states. Additionally, many of the remaining native populations lie on protected land, such as national parks or wildlife preserves. Drosera species are protected by law in many European countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, France, and Bulgaria. Currently, the largest threat in Europe and North America is habitat destruction for development projects, {{as well as the}} draining of bogs for agricultural uses and peat harvesting. In many regions, this has led to the <b>extirpation</b> of some species from parts of their former range. Reintroduction of plants into such habitats is usually difficult or impossible, as the ecological needs of certain populations is closely tied to their geographical location. Through increased legal protection of bogs and moors, as well as a concentrated effort to renaturalize such habitats, the threat to these plants' survival might be curbed, although most species would remain endangered. The relatively unimpressive image of these plants, as well as their small, low growth, makes them difficult to protect. As part of the landscape, sundews are often overlooked or not recognized at all.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and <b>extirpation,</b> either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
40|$|Applying {{ecological}} {{studies to}} the adaptations of prehistoric human hunter-gatherer groups has greatly increased our abilities to interpret {{effects of an}} ever-changing environment and our access to critical resources on these populations.

40|$|Aim Taxonomic dissimilarity between assemblages {{can result}} from two {{processes}} - the replacement of species (turnover) and differences in richness - but it remains unclear how anthropogenic drivers (introductions and <b>extirpations)</b> affect these processes. Here, we investigate how historical patterns and anthropogenic drivers shape the changes in dissimilarity and its turnover component in freshwater fish assemblages both in historical (i. e. pre-industrial) times and at the present day. Location World-wide. Methods We used a global database of fish assemblages in 1054 river basins throughout the world to quantify the change in turnover through its contribution to taxonomic dissimilarity between the two periods. We then used random forests to disentangle the relative roles of historical distinctiveness, species introductions and species <b>extirpations</b> on changes in dissimilarity and on the contribution of its turnover component. Results The pairs of basins exhibited {{a decrease in the}} contribution of turnover to taxonomic dissimilarity of 82 % and 61 % in homogenized and differentiated pairs, respectively. The historical number of shared species and its change after species introductions and <b>extirpations</b> accounted for more than 60 % of the change in dissimilarity and in the turnover contribution in the six biogeographical realms. Main conclusions The historically high distinctiveness between pairs of basins, due to a low number of shared species, has promoted high levels of taxonomic dissimilarity. The world-wide changes in taxonomic dissimilarity among fish assemblages are to a large extent coupled to a decrease in the contribution of taxonomic turnover to taxonomic dissimilarity. Hence, the dissimilarity between assemblages declines with decreasing species replacement. These changes are mainly explained by introductions of a small set of widespread non-native species, which promote {{an increase in the number}} of shared species. Alongside historical distinctiveness, species introduction processes can determine whether assemblages become more homogenized or more differentiated. Our results suggest that taxonomic differentiation can quickly turn to homogenization as the number of species introductions increase...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, several madtom species have, for unexplained reasons, been extirpated from {{sections}} of their naturally occurring range. One hypothesis states, [...] "...in addition to visible habitat degradation {{be related to}} their being unable to cope with olfactory 'noise' being added to riverine ecosystems {{in the form of}} a wide variety of complex organic chemicals that may occur only in trace amounts." [...] Many species that once existed throughout major portions of the Tennessee River now exist only as isolated remnant populations, and <b>extirpations</b> and extinctions are predicted.|$|R
5|$|The {{extermination}} of Northern Europe's wolves first became an organized effort during the Middle Ages, and continued {{until the late}} 1800s. In England, wolf persecution was enforced by legislation, and the last wolf {{was killed in the}} early sixteenth century during the reign of Henry VII. Wolves lasted longer in Scotland, where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest, which were subsequently burned down. Wolves managed to survive in the forests of Braemar and Sutherland until 1684. The <b>extirpation</b> of wolves in Ireland followed a similar course, with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786. A wolf bounty was introduced in Sweden in 1647, after the {{extermination of}} moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock. The Sami extirpated wolves in northern Sweden in organized drives. By 1960, few wolves remained in Sweden, because of the use of snowmobiles in hunting them, with the last specimen being killed in 1966. The gray wolf was exterminated in Denmark in 1772 and Norway's last wolf was killed in 1973. The species was decimated in 20th century Finland, despite regular dispersals from Russia. The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1900, though its numbers increased after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Threats to Bridgeoporus nobilissimus include <b>extirpation</b> {{of known}} and unknown {{habitats}} by logging, fire, or other disturbances, and forestry practices {{that lead to}} the loss of large-diameter Abies procera and Abies amabilis trees and large-diameter stumps and snags in managed forests. Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, B.nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States. It is the sole fungus in category A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the Northwest Forest Plan, meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus. There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the Pacific Northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006. Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that B.nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees of all sizes, and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. B.nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successively grown in vitro despite several attempts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [...] Large-scale {{assessments}} are useful tools for identifying population status of trout {{and other species}} throughout their ranges. We reviewed published and unpublished assessments for 15 native inland trout species in the United States to (1) evaluate common elements; (2) estimate lost habitat for native trout and (3) identify effective approaches or actions taken after completion of assessments to sustain native trout. Land use changes, loss of riparian vegetation, fragmentation of landscapes, poor land management practices, and presence of non-native fishes were the most common perturbations associated {{with the loss of}} native trout. We conservatively estimate that over half of the streams in the United States that historically supported native trout no longer do so. Many extirpated habitats may be hard to restore because of the difficulty of reversing land use changes or removing non-native fishes. Many <b>extirpations</b> occurred in the first 150 years after pioneer settlement but additional losses continue today. While many assessments have been effective at educating environmental professionals, most have had little influence in changing land use or realigning budgets for preservation or restoration. As human population growth and demands for natural resources increase, threats to native trout will likely increase resulting in further declines and <b>extirpations...</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{arrival of}} the first people about 4,000 years ago and, to a larger extent, of Europeans more than 500 years ago, [...] had a {{significant}} effect on Puerto Rico's fauna.
