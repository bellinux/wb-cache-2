Examples include Pinus radiata and Pinus taeda in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Numerous rare or {{endangered}} {{plant species}} have been observed {{in the vicinity of}} Harveys Lake. Plants {{in the vicinity of the}} lake include Vasey's pondweed, flat-leaved pondweed, grassy pondweed, broad-leaved water-milfoil, and Beck's water-marigold. However, <b>exotic</b> <b>and</b> invasive plants such as fanwort and aquatic coontail also inhabit the area and have altered the habitat in the vicinity of the lake. Second-growth forests occur in the area surrounding the lake.|$|E
5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the <b>exotic</b> <b>and</b> {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal means of access.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing <b>exotic</b> <b>and</b> highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|E

50|$|The {{internal}} consistency of the series suggests that the resolution to be sought in Childe is the evolution of Responsible Man, individuals who integrate the three disciplines of the Dorsai, the <b>Exotics,</b> <b>and</b> the Friendlies to the overall advancement of humanity, and who do possess explicit if not yet well-defined paranormal abilities. As of The Chantry Guild, only Donal Graeme/Hal Mayne has achieved the full status of Responsible Man. The conflict which drives this evolution is the developing war between Old Earth, supplemented by the Dorsai <b>and</b> the <b>Exotics,</b> <b>and</b> the organization of Others led by Bleys Ahrens, with the aid of the Friendlies and a powerful (but largely irrelevant to the psychological conflict) coalition of the technically inclined younger worlds. The strength of the Others is that they are hybrids of two of the Splinter Cultures (Ahrens is of Friendly <b>and</b> <b>Exotic</b> extraction), <b>and</b> while less capable than the emerging Responsible Men they are significantly more numerous, and more interested in gaining power for themselves (as by Ahrens using his combined background to manipulate the entire Friendly culture to support his war against the Dorsai, <b>Exotics,</b> <b>and</b> Old Earth).|$|R

40|$|The Higgs {{sector of}} the U(1) -extended supersymmetric model is studied with great detail. We {{calculate}} the masses of the Higgs bosons at the one-loop level.

We find that the <b>exotic</b> quark <b>and</b> <b>exotic</b> scalar quarks in the model may manifest themselves at the LHC, since the production of the heaviest scalar Higgs boson via gluon fusion processes is mediated virtually by the loops of <b>exotic</b> quark <b>and</b> <b>exotic</b> scalar quarks, for a reasonable parameter set of the model. 1...|$|R
