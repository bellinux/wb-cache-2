5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel {{but also the}} nau captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost {{for over a year}} {{following}} the disaster in the South Atlantic. The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E
2500|$|When I got to Cairo, I took {{a taxi to}} {{the address}} at which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> to report. [...] "Ah," [...] said the villanous-looking Egyptian who drove me, {{when he heard the}} address. [...] "You want Secret Service." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Ray Parkin edited a {{definitive}} account of Cook's voyage of 1768–1771, transcribing the Endeavour's original log, Cook's Journal and accounts by {{other members of}} the crew. Parkin transcribed the relevant Journal entry as [...] "...anchored in 4 fathom about a mile from the shore and then made a signal for the boats to come onboard, after which I went myself and bouy’d the channel which I found very narrow and the harbour much smaller than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> but very convenient for our purpose." [...] The log for 14 June also mentions the ship's boats sounding the way for the crippled Endeavour. Nevertheless, the influence of McIntyre's interpretation can still be seen in contemporary Australian school curriculum materials.|$|E

5000|$|... "In Stage Fright, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that my {{performance}} <b>is</b> quite juicy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> {{this with a}} certain air of tolerance, implying that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> now achieved the maximum limits of directorial ham in the movie sandwich. It isn't true. There may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a 'MacGuffin' in my film appearance, but not a ham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{tribes of}} Indians, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> <b>are</b> encamped {{not far from}} this spot," [...] said the missionary through his interpreter.|$|R
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
60|$|To my surprise, Zenobia--of whose haughty spirit <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> so many examples--absolutely changed color, {{and seemed}} mortified and confused.|$|E
60|$|I asked, 'Was there a child?' <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> by Mrs. ---- {{that there}} was a daughter, who had lived some years.|$|E

6000|$|But, O! {{the ground}} was damp, and so, [...] At least, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> The {{shepherd}} caught the lumbago, [...] The shepherdess, a cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew her}} under another name," [...] Godfrey said; [...] "but if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> she was Sophia Perovskaia, it {{conveyed}} nothing to me, for I {{had never heard}} of her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; the husband, Ferdinand Lefroy, {{the elder}} brother;--he of whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> {{that he was}} dead; he was there {{standing}} before us, talking to us,--half drunk, but still well knowing what he was doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But forgive me," [...] Selingman remarked, [...] "I am a {{stranger}} in this country. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that Maraton <b>is</b> {{a friend of the}} people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no divine, sir," [...] replied Captain Jekyl, with spirit; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> {{that the}} same may be said of most men alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother wore {{it at her}} bridal, and {{her mother}} too, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told.</b> Also once before I wrapped it about you--when you were christened, sweet." ...|$|R
60|$|The story--and {{this time}} Mrs Bowater poured it out quite freely--was {{precisely}} what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> already, {{but with the}} addition that {{the young woman who}} had hanged herself in one of its attics had done so for jealousy.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{surprised}}, Ada," [...] he remarked. [...] "Well, I cannot {{wonder at}} it. I {{should have been}} surprised myself if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that I was so sensitive to vascular influences. For, after all, all disturbances are vascular if you probe them deep enough. I am thinking of getting married." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a tract, {{that must}} be admitted, and realizing this, knowing that it was entirely too grim {{to find a place}} {{in the pages of the}} Century or Harper's I decided to send it to the Arena, a new Boston review whose spirit, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> was frankly radical.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} will kill us quickly and not put us to the torture. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> these Americans <b>are</b> painted Indians, who are bloodthirsty and terrible." ...|$|R

6000|$|Lord Fawn {{tried very}} hard to recollect, but would not look at the {{newspaper}} which had been handed to him. [...] "I cannot remember what words I used.

6000|$|... "No, sir, and I did {{not expect}} to do so. I went at their head all the way there, and four or five miles back; but should have had to give up, even if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that a big fortune awaited me, if I got in on foot. I should have had to say: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Leonard Horner {{also took}} me once {{to a meeting}} of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President, and he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a position. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and reverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and to my having {{attended}} the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these Societies, more than any other similar honour. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> at that time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that I should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that I should be elected King of England.|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> and to {{some extent}} have seen," [...] said Considine, with a sly glance; [...] "in fact they appear to be rather lazy than otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the plan--nothing less. If I am {{to believe}} what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> his feet will {{scarcely}} touch the ground between the prison-gates and the deck of that ship." ...|$|R
60|$|The sword may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> helpful. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that at levees City men, {{unaccustomed to}} the thing, have, with its help, {{provided}} comedy {{for the rest}} of the company.|$|R
60|$|No {{doubt the}} reader has long ago guessed it--has {{wondered}} why I had not. The {{fact remains that}} I had not. Out {{of the whole world}} Alan Fraser was the last man whom I should have suspected to be the writer of those letters--Alan Fraser, my hereditary enemy, who, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> cherished the old feud so faithfully and bitterly, and hated our very name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} what I had done--or, no, of what I had tried to do--in that {{interval}} between half-past ten and half-past eleven, which I have left unnoticed in my diary--and the deadly sickness of terror, which I never felt at the time, came upon me now. I sat down again, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> without speaking to Midwinter, and without looking at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Kitty?" [...] {{he said to}} his wife, handing to her the {{forefinger}} of {{his right}} hand by way of greeting.
