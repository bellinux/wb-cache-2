In order to better understandin the different influence of the parameters of glass alteration (chemical durability, temperature, relative humidity and exposition time), an ex-novo low-expensive system ha sbeen designed and realized for the reproduction of a confined environment and for the measure and control of relative humidity and temperature.

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>glass</b> blowing is an {{essential}} stage of manufacturing <b>glass</b> <b>containers,</b> i. e., bottles or jars. An initial glass preform is brought into a mold and subsequently blown into the mold shape. Over the past few decades, {{a wide range of}} numerical models for forward glass blow process simulation has been developed. A considerable challenge is the inverse problem: to determine an optimal preform from the desired container shape. A simulation model for blowing <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> based on finite element methods has previously been developed (Giannopapa, 2008, 2 ̆ 2 Development of a Computer Simulation Model for Blowing <b>Glass</b> <b>Containers,</b> 2 ̆ 2 ASME J.

This model uses level set methods to track the glass-air interfaces. The model described in a previous paper of the authors showed how to perform the forward computation of a final bottle from the given initial preform without using optimization. This paper introduces a method to optimize the shape of the preform combined with the existing simulation model. In particular, the new optimization method presented aims at minimizing the error in the level set representing the glass-air interfaces of the desired container. The number of parameters used for the optimization is restricted to a number of control points for describing the interfaces of the preform by parametric curves, from which the preform level set function can be reconstructed. Numerical applications used for the preform optimization method presented are the blowing of an axisymmetrical ellipsoidal container and an axisymmetrical jar...|$|R

Virtual reality (VR) is a capable means of activating phobic fear in patients. The representation of the patient’s body (e. g., the right hand) in VR enhances immersion and increases presence, but its effect on phobic fear is still unknown. We analyzed the influence of the presentation of the participant’s hand in VR on presence and fear responses in 32 women with spider phobia and 32 matched controls. Participants sat in front of a table with an acrylic <b>glass</b> <b>container</b> within reaching distance. During the experiment this setup was concealed by a head-mounted display (HMD).

Visibility of the hand was varied randomly in a within-subjects design. We found for all participants that visibility of the participant’s hand increased presence independently of the fear trigger. However, in patients, the influence of the virtual hand on fear depended on the fear trigger. When fear was triggered perceptually, i. e., by a virtual spider, the virtual hand increased fear. When fear was triggered by information about a real spider, the virtual hand had no effect on fear. Our results shed light on the significance of different fear triggers (visual, conceptual) in interaction with body representations...|$|R
