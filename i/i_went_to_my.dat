500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

In 2007, Tisdale told Newsday, [...] "When I was little, I saw the play Les Misérables on Broadway.

Tisdale toured for two years with Les Misérables before landing a role in a touring production of Annie in Korea.|$|E

There he was ordained a priest on August 31, 1925. He wrote on that occasion: [...] "How can I explain to you the sweet grace of the Holy Spirit, which invades my poor miner's soul with such heavenly joys? I could not hold back the tears {{on the day of}} my ordination, above all at the moment when I pronounced, together with the bishop, the words of the consecration.

May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head.
