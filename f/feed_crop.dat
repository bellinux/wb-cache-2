Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and mined minerals. Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the <b>feed</b> <b>crop</b> is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.|$|E
25|$|There are strong, direct {{relationships}} between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live {{in rural areas}} and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child malnutrition are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher {{the proportion of the}} rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. Food and <b>feed</b> <b>crop</b> demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on rainfed agriculture; improving soil fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in irrigation; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.|$|E
