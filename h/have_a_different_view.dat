25|$|Given {{the serious}} {{consequences}} that plagiarism has for students, {{there has been}} a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>view</b> of the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct.|$|E
500|$|Advance Wars: Days of Ruin {{features}} a style unlike previous {{entries in the}} series. When asked why it was changed, the developers stated {{that they wanted to}} surprise people. One of the people who localized Days of Ruin into English, Tim O'Leary, commented that the design change also came from reading comments from people that state to the effect: [...] "We like the game, we love the game, but it's the same thing." [...] In designing the new style, setting, and plot, the developers discovered that Japanese people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>view</b> on war than American people do, citing the previous titles' lighthearted take on war. As a result, they designed the game to be [...] "grittier" [...] and [...] "more somber". Another influence on the new setting was that Advance Wars was more successful in North America than it was in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subject of}} {{ethnicity}} in medieval Bosnia {{has been one}} of great debate ever since it was brought up in its current context by historians {{during the second half of}} the 19th century. All three ethnic groups in Bosnia <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>view</b> on the matter, and this complex and sensitive subject has been further obscured by nationalism and propaganda through the ages. Proving their people as the true heirs of the medieval Bosnian state is important to many nationalists because they consider this indigenousness to have important implications in modern social, political, and interethnic issues. Simply put, however, there is no sign that the population of pre-Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina, in whichever social stratum, had developed Croatian or Serbian ethnic consciousness even in a medieval sense of the word. To quote Noel Malcolm, chairman of the board of trustees at the Bosnian institute, from the book [...] "Bosnia A Short History": ...|$|E
