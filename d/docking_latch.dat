50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the mission, the CSM Kitty Hawk had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the LM Antares. Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that Roosa hold Kitty Hawk against Antares using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the <b>docking</b> <b>latches.</b> The sixth attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.|$|R
50|$|Soyuz 25 (Союз 25, Union 25) was a 1977 Soviet manned space flight, {{the first}} to the new Salyut 6 space station, which had been {{launched}} 10 days earlier. However, the mission was aborted when cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Valery Ryumin failed to engage the <b>docking</b> <b>latches</b> of the station despite five attempts. Lacking sufficient fuel to attempt a dock {{at the other end}} of the station and with battery power for only two days, they returned to Earth.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{virtually}} the entire crew is incapacitated. Captain Jaheel, who was desperate to leave to avoid infection, tries to leave DS9 without clearance, and ruptures his power core in the process. To prevent the resulting antimatter explosion from destroying half the station, Odo and Quark eject the ship by explosively releasing the <b>docking</b> <b>latches</b> holding it to the station; the ship explodes at a safe distance, and Surmak is eventually {{able to create a}} vaccine for the aphasia virus, based on the initial work of Bashir.|$|R
5000|$|After {{several small}} burns they were 151 ft away {{and with no}} {{relative}} velocity. After 30 minutes of visually inspecting the Agena {{to make sure that}} it had not been damaged by the launch, they were given the go for docking. Armstrong started to move towards the Agena at 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) per second. In a matter of minutes, the Agena's <b>docking</b> <b>latches</b> clicked and a green light indicated that the docking had been successfully completed. [...] "Flight, we are docked! Yes, it's really a smoothie," [...] Scott radioed to the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} {{task for the}} crew was Transposition, Docking and Extraction. The Lunar Module sat below the Command/Service Module, head-to-tail. As such, it was {{required}} for the CSM to separate from the S-IVB, travel a short distance, turn 180 degrees and then dock with and extract the Lunar Module. First the CSM separated, taking ten minutes to turn, come back and hard dock. About half an hour later, after pressurizing the Lunar Module and checking {{the integrity of the}} <b>docking</b> <b>latches,</b> the crew extracted Falcon from the S-IVB. The S-IVB would be put on a trajectory so that it would impact the lunar surface at 3°39'S, 7°35'W.|$|R
50|$|The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 21 but as Volynov {{tried to}} undock from the station, the <b>docking</b> <b>latches</b> failed to release properly. As he fired the jets {{to move the}} {{spacecraft}} away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved {{out of range of}} ground communications, the cosmonauts received only the first set of emergency procedures. Volynov tried a second time to undock but only managed slightly to loosen the latches. The situation persisted for an entire orbit, 90 minutes, when the final set of emergency procedures were received and the crew finally disengaged the latches.|$|R
40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} different types of docking types. The objective is the pressurized vehicle connection and crew transfer. Androgynous Docking is defined as the joining or coming together of two free flying space vehicles with alike interfaces. Androgynous mating allows for collaboration between any two vehicles. The subsytems of an androgynous mating system are reviewed, including: Hard <b>docking</b> subsystems: <b>latch</b> system, tunnel housing, alignment system and seal...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to accomplish the}} lunar landing mission by use of the lunar orbit rendezvous technique required that a docking system be developed to allow: (1) spacecraft modules to be structurally joined, (2) intravehicular transfer of the crew and equipment, and (3) separation of the modules. The basic design criteria of the docking system, the evolution process, and the various docking concepts considered for the Apollo program are presented. Docking systems that were considered for the Apollo program included both impact and nonimpact systems; a probe and drogue impact system was selected. Physical and functional descriptions of the probe and drogue, the crew transfer tunnel, and <b>docking</b> ring <b>latches</b> are presented for both the early configuration and the present configuration as influenced by the development and qualification test programs. In addition, preflight checkout activity and mission performance of the system are discussed...|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} capture and {{stabilization}} of the vehicles, the probe {{was capable of}} exerting a closing force of 1,000 lbf kN to draw the vehicles together. This force was generated by gas pressure acting on the center piston within the probe cylinder. Piston retraction compressed the probe and interface seals and actuated the 12 automatic ring latches which were located radially around the inner surface of the CSM <b>docking</b> ring. The <b>latches</b> were manually re-cocked in the docking tunnel by an astronaut after each hard docking event (lunar missions required two dockings).|$|R
5000|$|Following the on time <b>docking,</b> {{hooks and}} <b>latches</b> were engaged {{a few minutes}} after to secure the cargo ship to the ISS. Narrating about the event, NASA {{commentator}} Rob Navias said [...] "On the 11th anniversary of the arrival of the first residents of the International Space Station, supplies have arrived to fortify the station for the Expedition 29 crew and beyond," [...] on NASA TV. The Expedition 29 crew of Mike Fossum, Sergei Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa opened the hatches and entered the Progress spacecraft later on the day.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} is disclosed for the docking of a spacecraft to {{a space station}} where a connection for transfer of personnel and equipment is desired. The invention comprises an active docking structure on a spacecraft and a passive docking structure on the station. The passive structure includes a docking ring mounted on a tunnel structure fixed to the space station. The active structure includes a docking ring carried by an actuator-attenuator devices, each attached at {{one end to the}} ring and at its other end in the spacecraft payload bay. The devices respond to command signals for moving the docking ring between a stowed position in the spacecraft to a deployed position suitable for engagement with the docking ring. The devices comprise means responsive to signals of sensed loadings to absorb impact energy and retraction means for drawing the coupled spacecraft and station into final docked configuration and moving the tunnel structure to a berthed position in the spacecraft. Latches couple the spacecraft and space station upon contact of the <b>docking</b> rings and <b>latches</b> establish a structural tie between the spacecraft when retracted...|$|R
40|$|On this ninth {{day of the}} STS- 79 mission, {{the flight}} crew, Cmdr. William F. Readdy, Pilot Terrence W. Wilcutt, Mission Specialists, Thomas D. Akers, Shannon Lucid, Jay Apt, and Carl E. Walz having {{completed}} five days of joint operations between the American astronauts and the Russian cosmonauts are seen flying solo once again after undocking from the Mir Space Station. As Atlantis/Mir flew over the Ural Mountains of central Asia, the <b>docking</b> hooks and <b>latches</b> that joined the vehicles together were commanded open and Atlantis drifted slowly away from Mir. Wilcutt then initiated a tail-forward fly-around of the Russian space station. After one and one-half revolutions around Mir, Atlantis' jets were fired in a separation maneuver to enable Atlantis {{to break away from}} Mir. On board Atlantis, the six-member crew is settling back into its normal routine with a fairly light schedule {{for the remainder of the}} day. Early in the morning as Atlantis flew over the United States, the crew took time to talk with anchors for the CBS Up to the Minute' network news broadcast...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{bacterial}} pathogens {{can capture}} host plasminogen (Plg) and {{allow it to}} form plasmin. This process is of medical importance as surface-bound plasmin promotes bacterial spread by cleaving tissue components and favors immune evasion by degrading opsonins. In Staphylococcus aureus, Plg binding is in part mediated by cell surface fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs), but the underlying molecular mechanism is not known. Here, we use single-cell and single-molecule techniques to demonstrate that FnBPs capture Plg by a sophisticated activation mechanism involving fibrinogen (Fg), another ligand found in the blood. We show that while FnBPs bind to Plg through weak (∼ 200 -pN) molecular bonds, direct interaction of the adhesins with Fg through the high-affinity <b>dock,</b> lock, and <b>latch</b> mechanism dramatically increases the strength of the FnBP-Plg bond (up to ∼ 2, 000  pN). Our results point to a new model in which the binding of Fg triggers major conformational changes in the FnBP protein, resulting in the buried Plg-binding domains being projected and exposed away from the cell surface, thereby promoting strong interactions with Plg. This study demonstrated a previously unidentified role for a ligand-binding interaction by a staphylococcal cell surface protein, i. e., changing the protein orientation to activate a cryptic biological function...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a leading}} cause of lower {{respiratory}} tract infections in both adult and pediatric populations. In the past two decades, reports have described emergent incidence of severe necrotizing pneumonia in previously healthy individuals, frequently caused by antibiotic resistant strains. Additionally, S. aureus remains {{the most common cause of}} ventilator-associated pneumonia, contributing morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. As treatment of infection is made more difficult by the resistance to multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, there is a pressing need for novel strategies to prevent and treat S. aureus infections. Targeting essential mechanisms that promote infection such as adhesion, colonization, invasion, evasion of immune system and signaling may lead to inhibition of pathogenic surge. Staphylococcal adhesins of the MSCRAMM family (microbial surface components recognizing adherent matrix molecules) represent viable targets for such investigations. Understanding the molecular mechanism of binding is the first step toward the development of such therapies. Analysis of bacterial strains isolated from patients with staphylococcal pneumonia show increased expression of protein A, SdrD, SdrC and ClfB, cell surface proteins members of the MSCRAMM family. In this study the interaction of these MSCRAMMs with candidate ligands has been examined. We found that SdrD mediates S. aureus adherence to the lung epithelial cell line A 549. Consistently, bacteria expressing SdrD have increased persistence in the lungs of infected mice after bronchoalveolar lavage in comparison with bacteria lacking this protein. Inhibition studies revealed that bacterial attachment can be abolished using neutralizing antibodies against SdrD. Using phage display, neurexin β isoforms were identified as SdrC binding partners. Previous reports postulated that MSCRAMMS bind their ligands by a 2 ̆ 7 <b>dock,</b> lock and <b>latch</b> 2 ̆ 7 mechanism of interaction. Our data suggested that ClfB, an MSCRAMM responsible for nasal colonization, binds cytokeratin 10 by a 2 ̆ 7 dock and lock 2 ̆ 7 variant of this model, in which the 2 ̆ 7 latching 2 ̆ 7 event is not necessary. In summary, we have characterized aspects of molecular interaction between several MSCRAMMS and host components. We hope that continued delineation of these interactions will lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets or preventive strategies against S. aureus infections. ...|$|R
