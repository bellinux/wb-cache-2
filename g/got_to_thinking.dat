500|$|In 2013, Bibel {{criticized the}} soap opera when Victoria [...] "decided {{to give up a}} {{corporate}} career to become a children’s book author", writing: [...] "From the time she was SORASED into a teen, Victoria’s ambition was to run Newman Enterprises. She was the child who inherited Victor’s (Eric Braeden) business acumen. He, being a male chauvinist, always viewed the more family oriented Nick as his heir apparent. Her struggle to get her father’s recognition is what fueled her." [...] She also stated that while watching the series, there was [...] "the sense that women could, if that was what interested them, be power players". Of Victoria's choice to leave Newman Enterprises, Bibel wrote: [...] "For Victoria, it came across as giving up Peggy Olsen’s life for Betty Draper’s. I was also peeved by her telling her mother that she didn’t have the first idea of how to become an author. She ran a major cosmetics company. She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure out what she doesn’t know. I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about all of the ways that, over the past few months, the women of Genoa City have been, to use the lingo of Leaning In, the most popular non-fiction book in the country right now, leaning out." [...] Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood blamed head writer Josh Griffith for turning the character into a [...] "hard-nosed unforgiving socialite".|$|E

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of , after the Yankees had won four {{straight}} World Series victories, he made the following observation, which {{could just as easily}} have been made by The Professor's prize pupil, Yogi Berra (who would also become famous with many laughably quotable statements): [...] "If we're going to win the pennant, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> start <b>thinking</b> we're not as smart as we think we are." ...|$|R

500|$|Critics of The Wild Bunch {{noted the}} theme {{of the end of the}} outlaw gunfighter era. Pike Bishop says, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> start <b>thinking</b> beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast." [...] The Bunch live by an anachronistic code of honor without a place in 20th-century society. When they inspect Gen. Mapache's new automobile, they {{perceive}} it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970).|$|R
2500|$|Stevens {{contracted}} tuberculosis in 1969 and {{was close}} to death {{at the time of}} his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I <b>got</b> down <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut." ...|$|R

50|$|After {{returning}} home, {{the couple}} felt refreshed. Happy memories {{of their family}} break gave them new hope and the resolve to move forward. This <b>got</b> them <b>to</b> <b>thinking,</b> “Could we help others by providing holidays for families in similar situations?” By the early 1970s, Patrick had become a councillor and was given an allowance for his duties. One of his first ideas was to ask fellow councillors to donate their expenses (as he had) to facilitate the launch of a new charity. According to Joan, “Pat could talk a cat into having puppies,” so it {{came as no surprise}} when most agreed.|$|R

5000|$|... 100 Plus was {{published}} in 2011, with a foreword by Peter Thiel, a longtime friend whom Arrison had introduced to leading life extension researchers. Arrison was a speaker at the October 2011 Singularity Summit in New York, and appeared as a guest on Stossel on December 22, 2011. In a 2012 CBS News interview, Arrison stated that she was inspired to write 100 Plus after viewing an episode of the U.S. reality TV series, The Swan, in which participants were overjoyed to receive a makeover involving relatively minor plastic surgery procedures. Arrison stated that this <b>got</b> her <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about the possible societal changes accompanying the much more substantial changes becoming possible through new medical advances.|$|R

5000|$|When he was hospitalized, Stevens {{was often}} {{alone in a}} very spare and plain room. He was told {{that at the time}} he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him.

He said, [...] "To go from the show {{business}} environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I <b>got</b> down <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut."

60|$|I had sadly broken {{sleep when}} I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bed, through <b>thinking</b> {{of the strange}} man taking aim at me with his {{invisible}} gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself <b>to</b> sleep by <b>thinking</b> of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake.|$|R

40|$|No {{abstract}} available. Article truncated at 150 words. I recently renewed my Arizona medical {{license and}} meet all the requirements. I far exceed the required CME hours {{and have no}} Medical Board actions, removal of hospital privileges, lawsuits, or felonies. None of the bad things are likely since I have not seen patients since July 1, 2011 and I no longer have hospital privileges. However, this caused me to pause when I came {{to the question of}} “Actively practicing”? A quick check of the status of several who do not see patients but are administrators, retired or full time editors of other medical journals revealed they were all listed as “active”. I guess that “medical journalism” is probably as much a medical activity as “administrative medicine” which is recognized by the Arizona Medical Board.

40|$|From initial paragraph] For {{the last}} 5 years, {{most of the}} conference papers I have {{presented}} or articles I have written have begun with the usual obligatory introduction to the “newly emerging” subdiscipline of carceral geography. That is, of course, research “specifically alighting on the spaces set aside for ‘securing’ – detaining, locking up/away – problematic populations {{of one kind or}} another” (Philo, 2012 : 4). However, to paraphrase a colleague participating in one of three sessions entitled “Mapping Carceral Geography” at the 2014 Royal Geographical Society of the Institute of British Geographers, “we do not need to keep saying this anymore; we have definitely emerged”. This <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about the politics of emergent or indeed “recently emerged” areas of a discipline and their propensity to continue their momentum to become both prolific in their own right and sustain academic longevity.

In the same season, he also spent 143 minutes in the penalty box [...] "Mike Milbury said, 'I {{want you to think}} about what you're doing by putting yourself into the penalty box. If you're going to fight, make sure it's on your terms and not just because someone is challenging you.' He was trying to make me understand who I was going in the box with. He'd say, 'I don't want to take away from you dropping your gloves, but, I don't want you to think about not doing it. I just want you to think about how your reaction affects both their team and our team.' So it <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> a little more about my role.

5000|$|Virtually unknown at his death, Drake {{has since}} {{become one of the}} {{greatest}} examples of an artist achieving posthumous fame and influence.

Like most of those (make that all of those) who'd known him in whatever way, I'd <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> of him as a private thing, an artist relegated to the exclusive periphery, one for the connoisseur." [...] By the 1980s Drake's work had gained a cult audience, which grew throughout the 1990s and by the 2000s has reached a point of widespread fame. With an influence extending from alternative rock to free jazz, and including figures as diverse as R.E.M., Radiohead, David Gray and Beth Orton, the actors Brad Pitt and Heath Ledger and the film director Sam Mendes, his work is now revered as one of the greatest achievements both of British folk music and of the entire singer-songwriter genre worldwide.|$|R
