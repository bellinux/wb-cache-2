25|$|After his {{intervention}} in Ireland, Henry II effectively divided the English colony into liberties {{also known as}} lordships. These were effectively county palatines and differed from ordinary counties in that they were <b>disjoined</b> from the crown and that whoever they were granted to essentially had the same authority as the king and that the king's writ had no effect except a writ of error. This covered all land within the county that was not church land. The reasons for the creating of such powerful entities in Ireland {{was due to the}} lack of authority the English crown had there. The same process occurred after the Norman conquest of England where despite there being a strong central government, county palatines were needed in border areas with Wales and Scotland. In Ireland this meant that the land was divided and granted to Richard de Clare and his followers who became lords (and sometimes called earls), with the only land which the English crown had any direct control over being the sea-coast towns and territories immediately adjacent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} method of direct {{measurement}} of the <b>disjoining</b> pressure isotherm for sing, isolated foam films stabilized with TTAB above cmc by microinterferometric technique. It has been studied that the relation of <b>disjoining</b> pressure and film thickness, {{and the difference between}} the surface tension of solution and that of the common black film under different liquid film thickness conditions. The experimental results show that common black film thickness depends on the <b>disjoining</b> pressure and electrolytic concentration. At a low <b>disjoining</b> pressure, the film thickness decreases with the increase of the <b>disjoining</b> pressure. At a high <b>disjoining</b> pressure, the film thickness decreases slightly with the increase of the <b>disjoining</b> pressure. This signifies that the transition between black films is jumping. The electrolyte can reduce the interaction forces between two charged monolayers of film and thin the film, so the equilibrium thickness of film decreases with increasing electrolyte concentration of the solution from which they are formed.

While coupling enhances condensate flow due to transport of condensate lenses by the gas, it dramatically reduces gas permeability by introducing capillary resistance against gas flow. In this study, a dynamic wetting approach is used to investigate the effect of viscous resistance, IFT and <b>disjoining</b> pressure on pore-scale coupling of gas and condensate. <b>Disjoining</b> pressure arises from van der Waals interactions between gas and solid through thin liquid films, e. g., condensate films on pore walls.
