40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>charging</b> of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> with <b>charging</b> {{power of}} 3, 7 kW, in connection {{to an apartment}} building in Sweden. Also the power consumption of six <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> are investigated. The charging-simulations of the <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> were performed with the <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> model (Grahn-Munkhammar) in MatLab. To simulate general energy use for a housing complex, the measured energy consumption per year for a building with 24 apartments was used. Three different systems with charging over a year were simulated. One system included six different models of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles,</b> another system included six Tesla model S and yet another one included six Mitsubishi Outlanders. The simulations of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> resulted in a charging pattern with a considerable variability and an aggregation effect with a value over 20 % for all three systems. Results show that <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> adds to the power peaks of the apartment building.

40|$|With an {{electrified}} passenger transportation fleet, {{carbon dioxide}} emissions could be reduced significantly depending on the electric power production mix. Increased electric power consumption due to <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> demands of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleets may be met by increased amount of renewable power production in the electrical systems. With <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleets in the transportation system {{there is a need}} for establishing an <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure that distributes this power to the <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Depending on the amount of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the system and the <b>charging</b> patterns, <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> integration creates new quantities in the overall load profile that may increase the load peaks. The <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> patterns are stochastic since they are affected by the travel behavior of the driver and the charging opportunities which implies that an <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> introduction also will affect load variations. Increased load variation and load peaks may create a need for upgrades in the grid infrastructure to reduce losses, risks for overloads or damaging of components. However, with well-designed incentives for <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> users and <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging,</b> the <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> may be used as flexible loads that can help mitigate load variations and load peaks in the power system. The aim with this doctoral thesis is to investigate and quantify the impact of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> on load profiles and load variations. Three key factors are identified when considering the impact of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> on load profiles and load variations. The key factors are: The charging moment, the charging need and the charging location. One of the conclusions in this thesis is that the level of details and the approach to model these key factors impact the estimations of the load profiles. The models that take into account a high level of mobility details will be able to create a realistic estimation of a future uncontrolled charging behavior, enabling for more accurate estimates of the impact on load profiles and the potential of individual charging strategies and external charging strategies. The thesis reviews and categorizes <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> models in previous research, and furthermore, introduces new <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> models to estimate the charging impact based on charging patterns induced by passenger car travel behavior. The models mainly consider EVC related to individual car travel behavior and induced charging needs for plug-in-hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Moreover, the thesis comments on dynamic <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> along electrified roads and also on individual charging strategies.

The new connector is able to provide 3-phase charging up to 32 A as being examined in the Formula E-Team tests. Schneider Electric emphasises that the [...] "EV Plug" [...] uses shutters over the socket side pins which is required in 12 European countries and that none of the other proposed EV charger plugs is featuring. Limiting the plug to 32 A allows for cheaper plugs and installation costs. The EV Plug Alliance points out that the future IEC 62196 specification will have an annexe categorizing <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charger</b> plugs into three types (Yazaki's proposal is type 1, Mennekes' proposal is type 2, Scame's proposal is type 3) and that instead of having a single plug type at both ends of a charger cable one should choose the best type for each side â€” the Scame / EV Plug would be the best option for the charger side / wall box leaving the choice for the car side open. On 22 September 2010, the companies Citelum, DBT, FCI, Leoni, Nexans, Sagemcom, Tyco Electronics joined the Alliance.

LCPT vehicle chargers are wireless and there is no contact problems and maintenance so it is a maintenance free charger.

40|$|Electric vehicle {{chargers}} and batteries {{installed on}} the electrical grid have increased in the recent years. EV-chargers can increase the power needed in the grid while batteries give costumers new possibilities {{to control their own}} power consumption. This opens up a new situation where synergy between the utility and the costumers can be achieved. Less maximum power drawn from the grid allows the utility to use the power elsewhere while the costumers pay less for their electrical bill. This master thesis proves that the potential for synergy is good from a technical perspective, both with current <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charger</b> technology and with future technology that will allow power also can to be fed into the grid and not just drawn from the grid. Although the technical potential is good the practical potential is still limited due to a number of reasons. Currently, the economic incentive for the costumers is too small to justify an investment in batteries so the cost for batteries needs to decrease. Furthermore, the legislative situation is far from optimal with a legal framework that does not encourage batteries in any part of the electrical grid. The legal and technical challenges create a situation that causes further problems with possible business models and all of these problems need solutions in order to stimulate the market for batteries on the electrical grid...|$|E
