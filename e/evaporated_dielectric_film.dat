40|$|The {{topic of}} thin films {{is an area}} of {{increasing}} importance in materials science, electrical engineering and applied solid state physics; with both research and industrial applications in microelectronics, computer manufacturing, and physical devices. Advanced, high-performance computers, high-definition TV, broadband imaging systems, flat-panel displays, robotic systems, and medical electronics and diagnostics are a few examples of the miniaturized device technologies that depend on the utilization of thin film materials. This book presents an in-depth overview of the novel developments made by the scientific leaders in the area of modern <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> for advanced microelectronic applications. It contains clear, concise explanations of material science of <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> and their problem for device operation, including high-k, low-k, medium-k <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> and also specific features and requirements for <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> used in the packaging technology.

40|$|The {{conduction}} {{mechanisms in}} <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> {{are crucial to}} the successful applications of dielectric materials. There {{are two types of}} conduction mechanisms in <b>dielectric</b> <b>films,</b> that is, electrode-limited conduction mechanism and bulk-limited conduction mechanism. The electrode-limited conduction mechanism depends on the electrical properties at the electrode-dielectric interface. Based on this type of conduction mechanism, the physical properties of the barrier height at the electrode-dielectric interface and the effective mass of the conduction carriers in <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> can be extracted. The bulk-limited conduction mechanism depends on the electrical properties of the dielectric itself. According to the analyses of bulk-limited conduction mechanisms, several important physical parameters in the <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> can be obtained, including the trap level, the trap spacing, the trap density, the carrier drift mobility, the dielectric relaxation time, and the density of states in the conduction band. In this paper, the analytical methods of conduction mechanisms in <b>dielectric</b> <b>films</b> are discussed in detail...|$|R

Here, we report the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) behaviour of sessile drops on <b>dielectric</b> elastomer <b>films</b> of varying elasticities- from an apparently rigid <b>dielectric</b> <b>film</b> to a soft, deformable <b>dielectric</b> <b>film.</b> Our results {{reveal that the}} elasticity of the underlying <b>dielectric</b> <b>film</b> provides an additional control over the droplet electrowetting behaviour, which may be best addressed from free energy based consideration, leading to a modification of the classical Lippman-Young paradigm. We also provide an explanation on the displacement profiles for the deformation of the soft dielectric surface, due to the interfacial electro-elastocapillary interaction triggered by the electrowetted sessile droplet. These results can be of profound importance in various emerging applications, ranging from the development of soft liquid lenses to drug delivery. Comment: 27 pages; 3 figure...|$|R

They include Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, internal Schottky (or Pool-Frenkel) effect, two-step (or trap-assisted) tunneling, shallow-trap-assisted tunneling, and band-to-band tunneling.

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} HfO 2 gate dielectrics prepared under different annealing conditions were investigated. We found that the large leakage currents are mostly associated with the high trap density in the <b>dielectric</b> <b>films.</b> Several charge transport mechanisms have significant contributions to the large leakage current. To study {{the reliability of the}} gate <b>dielectric</b> <b>film</b> grown under different annealing conditions, the capacitors were stressed at constant voltages for different durations.
