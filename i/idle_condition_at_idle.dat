40|$|Cycling of the {{relative}} humidity (RH) levels in the reactant streams of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells {{has been reported to}} decay fuel cell performance. This study focuses on the accelerated durability testing to examine different modes of membrane failure via RH cycling. A single PEM fuel cell with an active area of 42. 25 cm 2 was tested. A Greenlight G 50 test station was used to establish baseline cell (Run 1) performance with 840 hours of degradation under high-humidity <b>idle</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> a constant current density of 10 mA cm- 2. Under the same conditions, two other experiments were conducted by varying the RH. For the H 2 -air RH cycling test (Run 2), anode and cathode inlet gases were provided as dry and humidified gases. Another RH cycling experiment was the H 2 RH cycling test (Run 3) : the anode inlet gas was cycled whereas keeping the other side constantly at full humidification. These two RH cycling experiments were alternated in dry and 100 % humidified conditions every 10 and 40 minutes, respectively. In the experiments, the fuel cells contained a GoreTM 57 catalyst coated membrane (CCM) and 35 BC SGL gas diffusion layers (GDLs). The fuel cell test station had been performed under <b>idle</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> a constant current density of 10 mA cm- 2. Under the <b>idle</b> <b>conditions,</b> operating <b>at</b> very low current density, a low chemical degradation rate and minimal electrical load stress were anticipated. However, the membrane was expected to degrade due to additional stress from the membrane swelling/contraction cycle controlled by the RH. In this work the performance of the 100 % RH humidified cell (Run 1) was compared with that of RH cycling cells (Run 2 and Run 3). Chemical and mechanical degradation of the membrane were investigated using in-situ and ex-situ diagnostic methods. The results of each measurement during and after fuel cell operation are consistent. They clearly show that changing in RH lead to an overall PEM fuel cell degradation due to the increase in membrane degradation rate from membrane resistance, fluoride ion release concentration, hydrogen crossover current, membrane thinning, and hot-spot/pin-hole formation...|$|R

During this time, the engine can not work at peak operating temperature. This leads to incomplete combustion and emissions level increase due to having fuel residues in the exhaust. Also, idling results in increase in fuel consumption. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate fuel consumption and emissions parameters under high <b>idling</b> <b>conditions</b> when diesel blended with Jatropha curcas biodiesel is used to operate a diesel engine. Although biodiesel diesel blends decrease carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, they increase nitrogen oxides emissions in high idling modes. Compared to pure diesel fuel, fuel consumption also increases under all high <b>idling</b> <b>conditions</b> for biodiesel -diesel blends, with a further increase occurring as blend percentage rises...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} algorithm {{development and}} analysis strategies for diesel engine systems incorporating variable valve actuation (VVA) {{as a means}} to enable premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) and cylinder deactivation (CDA). The VVA system enables cylinder-independent, cycle-by-cycle control of the opening timing, closing timing, and lift for both the intake and exhaust valves. ^ PCCI is a low-temperature combustion strategy for reducing in-cylinder NOx and particulate matter (PM) formation without additional fuel penalty. This is achieved by allowing the injected diesel fuel and charge gas to premix before the mixture auto-ignites as a result of compression. This type of combustion tends to eliminate high temperature reaction zones and the fuel rich pockets which typically lead to formation of NOx and PM, respectively. However, one of the challenges in PCCI implementation is that the process does not allow direct control of the combustion timing. The crank angle of 50 % heat release, known as the CA 50, is generally a reasonable proxy for the quality of combustion in terms of maximum pressure rise rate, combustion noise, and fuel conversion efficiency. This thesis outlines the development, and validation, of a real-time capable estimation strategy for PCCI CA 50 using production-viable measurements that do not include in-cylinder pressure. The strategy is demonstrated to estimate CA 50 within 2 CAD for 65 out of 80 data points, and has an error standard deviation of 2. 55 CAD. ^ CDA is a technology that can improve the fuel economy and exhaust thermal management of compression ignition engines (diesel and natural gas), especially at low loads and engine <b>idling</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>At</b> low loads, the reduction in engine displacement during CDA improves fuel efficiency primarily through a reduction in pumping work. However, with no combustion occuring in the deactivated cylinders, in-cylinder pressure drops, enabling the transport of engine lubricating oil from the crankcase into the deactivated cylinder, an undesirable result. As an example, during experiments described in this thesis, in-cylinder oil mass levels reach 72 mg to 488 mg following 20 minutes of deactivation. ^ Cylinder cool-down and oil accumulation during deactivation could possibly result in misfire or degraded combustion upon an attempt to reactivate a given cylinder. Fortunately, experiments described in this thesis demonstrate no cases of misfire <b>at</b> any speed/load <b>conditions</b> for the CDA durations tested, specifically, 100 ft-lb load at 800 rpm and 1200 rpm with deactivation intervals of 0. 5, 5, 10 and 20 minutes. Although pilot heat release in the reactivated cylinders was delayed by approximately 1 CAD after 5 minutes of CDA, the main heat release was very similar to the heat release of a continuously activated cylinder. As such, results show no first fire readiness issues <b>at</b> the <b>conditions</b> tested. The duration of time the engine could be operated in CDA mode without significant oil accumulation, and other methods to minimize oil accumulation during CDA have also been proposed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} large eddy simulation (LES) of flow {{structures and}} pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a light-duty diesel vehicle for both {{high and low}} <b>idling</b> <b>conditions</b> within the urban road microenvironments was performed. Four different grid resolutions with and without coordinate transformation were used for evaluating the grid independence on computational results of the LES approach. Time-averaged velocities, temperatures and pollutant concentrations along the centreline of the vehicular exhaust plume have been calculated for both high and low <b>idling</b> <b>conditions.</b> The computational {{results show that the}} finer grid cell provides a better agreement with the experimental results for both <b>idling</b> <b>conditions.</b> Furthermore, the computational work has been extended to investigate the effect of ambient wind conditions (i. e., wind speed and direction) on the flow dynamics and pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a light-duty diesel vehicle for high <b>idling</b> <b>condition.</b> For the low ambient wind speed case, the vehicular exhaust jet plume dominates the flow structures and the pollutant dispersion patterns. On the other hand, for the higher ambient wind speed case, the vortices and turbulence mixing induced by the interaction between the vehicular exhaust jet and the ambient wind dilute the pollutant concentration, while the oblique ambient wind may alter the spreading direction of the vehicular exhaust jet plume.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{ignition}} advance angle and {{excess air ratio}} on the combustion and emissions characteristics were investigated on a CNG engine <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> <b>conditions.</b> The throttle valve was fully closed. When the parameters were changed, the stepper motor was adjusted automatically to control the engine speed at 800 r/min. When the θi is changed from 40 to 10 o BTDC, the maximum ITE and the maximum power are observed at λ= 1. 1. As λ increases, the maximum ITE is corresponding to a greater θi. The COVimep will be increased if the θi is too advanced or too small. When λ is more than 1. 3, the COVimep increases obviously. When λ= 1. 1, NOx emissions get the highest level.
