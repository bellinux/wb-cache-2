[...] Roberts explains, [...] " [...] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..." [...] On the other hand, in the National Post review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for [...] "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable." [...] Foster ended his review by insulting Wright's intellect, [...] "What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright's mind, which carries a set of inflated, emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics." ...|$|E
500|$|While Ray Davies {{had been}} {{instructed}} {{at the time}} to write [...] "Beatle-type" [...] material for commercial reasons, [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was written as a more R composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff by Dave Davies, which has since been referred to as [...] "instantly identifiable." [...] American musicologist Robert Walser described [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as [...] "the first hit song built around power chords." [...] The song has since been labeled as an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic writing, You Really Got Me' remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal." [...] However, Dave Davies has since rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying [...] "I've never really like that term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. <b>Just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound—if you played it on a ukulele, it might not have been so powerful." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Revolution 909" [...] is {{followed}} by [...] "Da Funk", which carries elements of funk and acid music. According to Andrew Asch of the Boca Raton News, the song's composition [...] "relies on a bouncy funk guitar to communicate its message of dumb fun." [...] Bangalter expressed that [...] "Da Funk"'s theme involved {{the introduction of a}} simple, unusual element that becomes acceptable and moving over time. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine complimented the song as [...] "unrelenting", and Bob Gajarsky of Westnet called it [...] "a beautiful meeting of Chic (circa [...] "Good Times", sans vocals) and the 90s form of electronica." [...] The song appeared on the soundtrack for the 1997 film The Saint and was placed at number 18 on Pitchforks [...] "Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s" [...] list. [...] "Phœnix" [...] combines elements of gospel music and house music. The duo considered [...] "Fresh" [...] to be breezy and light with a comical structure. Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine criticized the song, stating that it [...] "doesn't feel like the beach <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lapping waves heard in the background." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences.

Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well.

[...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, {{unlike a lot of}} Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if {{he really wanted to}} be with her or if it was <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby."

At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle.

Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body’s discomfort in the physical realm. “…The Proficient’s will is set always and only inward.” (Enneads I.4.11) ...|$|E

2500|$|In stage three, {{birth rates}} fall due to various {{fertility}} {{factors such as}} access to contraception, increases in wages, urbanization, a reduction in subsistence agriculture, {{an increase in the}} status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes. [...] Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe. While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, {{it should be noted that}} contraceptives were not generally available nor widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then. It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> availability of contraceptives.|$|E

2500|$|The {{liquidity}} premium theory is {{an offshoot of}} the pure expectations theory. [...] The {{liquidity premium}} theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term.

In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint.
