5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.|$|E

[...] Lord Brougham, who regularly opposed him in court, wrote that [...] "no description can give the reader an adequate idea of this eminent practitioner's powers in thus dealing with a witness".

500|$|In March 1969, Harrison gave [...] "Something" [...] to Joe Cocker to record, having {{decided that}} it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax. Referring to this and similar {{examples}} where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying: [...] "I think he was totally confident about the songs. The insecurity may have been, if the Beatles kept going, 'How many songs am I {{going to be able to}} get on each album?', and with the backlog sort of mounting up... <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> there, and get something from it." ...|$|E

And I’d like to get some sax players—jazz players and other kinds. And I’ll definitely use Shankar Mahadevan, the amazing vocalist who appears on Remember Shakti’s Saturday Night in Bombay.

There, what seemed a mild {{exchange}} of trivial personal data is revealed in [...] "mental subtitles" [...] as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You"). He suggests they kiss first to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the way.

In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions will be helmed by Nick Raskulinecz, who produced the band's last two albums. Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album. According to Inez, the band is not currently signed to a label, having completed its previous two-record contract with the Universal Music Group. [...] "This , we're not sure where it's gonna land...

500|$|The {{composition}} and {{setting of the}} scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns' health is partially inspired by a scene from Citizen Kane where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide.

The title is a play on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s autobiography Yes, I Can. Homer mistells the story of [...] "Androcles and the Lion", instead referring to it as [...] "Hercules and the Lion". A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Burns's line about getting [...] "A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present" [...] is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books. The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns, and the scene where he and Bart attempt to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the mailbox, are inspired by the Honeymooners episode [...] "Letter to the Boss".|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Black Eye deal with sexual and abuse topics: [...] "Nothing you will likely {{hear on the}} radio", Rootes explained. The song [...] "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling {{vibrator}} in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, [...] "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E

Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands."

Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of my head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it.
