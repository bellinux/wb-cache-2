5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the grammatical subject, creating {{a set of}} four verb subclasses. The {{distinction between the two}} genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>gender</b> segmentation <b>of</b> occupations {{and the extent to which}} the <b>gendered</b> nature <b>of</b> a technology, or the use of that technology, is transferred from one country to another. Two imported technologies, the postal system and the telephone, are used as case studies to explore the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> occupations in Meiji Japan. I argue that the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> these occupations was the outcome of the nature of the imported technologies, the need to make the technology work in local circumstances, the required attributes of employees and prevailing social perceptions <b>of</b> <b>gender.</b> The <b>gender</b> division <b>of</b> labour that resulted was in both cases similar to, but not identical with, that in the countries from which the technologies came. However, the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> postal occupations in early Meiji was not the subject of any formal consideration by the authorities, whereas the later arrival of the telephone in the early 1890 s was associated with a more carefully planned <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> telephony along the lines of Western industrial economies. In both cases, though, the <b>gender</b> division <b>of</b> labour initially established persisted through much of the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to define the {{depression}} symptom levels and the mobbing executions’ levels they are subjected to according to <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> vocational high school students. The ranks of being subjected to mobbing and the depression levels are examined via the <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> the students. According to the findings, there is a significant correlation between the <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> the students and being subjected to mobbing, but there is no statistical correlation between <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> the students and the occurrence of depression symptoms. As a result of the statistical analysis, even though the male students are subjected to mobbing more than the female students, there is no statistical difference between the levels of depression symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The article {{comprehensively}} {{reviews the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} work on gender and the knowledge society and introduces the articles of the special issue. Three {{ways in which the}} knowledge society and economy are gendered are distinguished: the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> human capital; the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> networks and the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> the definitions of the knowledge society. Using data from the Labour Force Survey, an original analysis <b>of</b> the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> the UK knowledge economy is presented. It finds that the choice of definition of the knowledge economy makes a difference to its gender composition: the more centred on technology and fixed capital, the more masculine, the more centred on human capital, the more gender balanced. The knowledge economy provides better work and conditions. Gender gaps are narrower in the knowledge economy than the overall economy: occupational hierarchies are narrowed to women's advantage, while differences in work temporalities are narrowed to men's advantage...|$|R

5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the noun.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, {{but not on the}} <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} representations <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in {{the financial}} annual reports of 30 corporations. Building on several critical theoretical perspectives, it examines how annual reports contribute to the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> organisations through an empirical study <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in their texts, statistics and images. The results suggest that stereotypical images are dominant and the representational practices reinforce the traditional <b>gendered</b> division <b>of</b> labour. We conclude that the masculine connotation of financial reports thwarts a more diverse representation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in organisations...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, {{the person of the}} subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist.

Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised.|$|E

5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive verb. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the addressee).|$|E
