He was working as an unofficial assistant to Jean Martin Charcot at La Salpêtrière. While substituting for his teacher, Louis J.F. Delasiauve, he attended to Marie, a 15-year-old girl with psychomotor retardation, epilepsy and a [...] "confluent vascular-papulous eruption of the nose, the cheeks and forehead". She {{had a history of}} seizures since infancy and was taken to the children's hospital aged three and declared a <b>hopeless</b> <b>case.</b> She had learning difficulties and could neither walk nor talk. While under Bourneville's care, Marie had an ever-increasing number of seizures, which came in clusters. She was treated with quinquina, bromide of camphor, amyl nitrite, and the application of leeches behind the ears. On 7 May 1879 Marie died in her hospital bed. The post-mortem examination disclosed hard, dense tubers in the cerebral convolutions, which Bourneville named Sclérose tubéreuse des circonvolutions cérébrales. He concluded they were the source (focus) of her seizures. In addition, whitish hard masses, one [...] "the size of a walnut", were found in both kidneys.|$|E

In addition, he has a certain base side to his nature which likes coarseness, uncouthness, roughness. He flaunts his illiteracy, takes pride in his ignorance, mucks along anyhow, blindly believing in the infallibility of his genius. Yet he has flashes of talent which are, moreover, not devoid of originality." ...|$|E

[...] "Positively demented," [...] said one, [...] "I {{consider it}} a <b>hopeless</b> <b>case.</b> She needs to be put where someone {{will take care of}} her." [...] The head of the insane pavilion at Bellevue Hospital pronounced her [...] "undoubtedly insane". The case of the [...] "pretty crazy girl" [...] attracted media attention: [...] "Who Is This Insane Girl?" [...] asked the New York Sun. The New York Times wrote of the [...] "mysterious waif" [...] with the [...] "wild, haunted look in her eyes" [...] and her desperate cry: [...] "I can't remember I can't remember." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harry Lee, the Middlesex batsman was {{reported}} {{killed in action}} in 1915, soon after enlisting, and a memorial service was held in his honour. [...] He {{had been shot in}} the leg at the Battle of Aubers Ridge and lay for three days between the lines before being taken into German custody and repatriated as a <b>hopeless</b> <b>case.</b> His leg, although shortened and withered, recovered enough for him to make a century at Lancing in 1917. [...] Unable to serve again in the forces he took a position in 1917 as cricket and football coach to the Maharajah of Cooch Behar and was booked to sail to India on the S.S. Nyanza. [...] At the last moment his passage was switched to the Nagoya: [...] the Nyanza was torpedoed just out of Plymouth. [...] He went on to play 437 first-class games and a Test match for England, against South Africa at Johannesburg in February 1931.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates asks Protagoras [...] "in {{respect to}} what" [...] Hippocrates will improve by associating with him, {{in the manner}} that by associating himself to a doctor he would improve in {{medicine}} (318d). Protagoras begins his discourse {{with the statement that}} a good Sophist can make his students into good citizens. [...] Socrates says that this is fine and good, but that he personally believes that this is not feasible since virtue cannot be taught (319b). He adds that technical thinking (technē) can be imparted to students by teachers, but that wisdom cannot be. By way of example, Socrates points to the fact that while in matters concerning specialised labour one would only take advice from the appropriate specialist, like for example builders (τέκτονες) about construction, in matters of state everyone's opinions is considered, which proves that political virtue is within everyone, or that at least that is what Athenians in their democratic ideals believe. Another example is that Pericles did not manage to impart his wisdom to his sons (319e). Socrates' uses a similar example in the Meno. He then adds that Clinias, younger brother of Alcibiades, was taken from the family for fear that Alcibiades would corrupt him, and he was given back as a <b>hopeless</b> <b>case.</b> Socrates says he could give more examples, but thinks his point is sufficiently established.|$|E
