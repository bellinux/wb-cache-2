5|$|A teleporting mutant. This was will.i.am's major live-action film debut. Although he {{initially}} {{did not get}} on with the casting director, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> role because he wanted to play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler. He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part. When filming a fight, he scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, Faramir {{is played by}} David Wenham. The actor jokes that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses. Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a statement in Unfinished Tales, lacked beards.|$|E

He again worked with Burrell, as well as Donald Byrd and Yusef Lateef, among others.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Brunson was an All-Lake County {{honorable mention}} {{selection}} in 2012, as Stevenson finished {{the season with}} a 1711 record.

5|$|He {{received}} the presbyterate {{in the first}} months of 1786, and was appointed for the Concepción parish, the same one where he was baptized. He also worked at the aforementioned House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> curacy of Magdalena on 12 September 1790, but resigned a year later because of health problems. He returned in 1793, and resigned definitively on 21 February 1794. After this, he moved to Maldonado. There are few historical records of his activities in those curacies.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> {{chance to put}} his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice.

The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E

Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity to meet}} Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then {{decided to try to}} translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E

5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance.

5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.|$|E
5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E
