5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the infant}} princess {{was given a}} splendid christening, but Anne feared that Catherine's daughter, Mary, now {{stripped}} of her title of princess and labelled a bastard, posed a threat to Elizabeth's position. Henry soothed his wife's fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to Hatfield House, where Princess Elizabeth would be living with her own sizeable staff of servants, and where the country air was thought better for the baby's health. Anne frequently visited her <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> Hatfield and other residences.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's <b>daughter,</b> <b>at</b> {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The {{progress}} {{of their relationship}} was slowed by Hobbs' shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it {{was reported in the}} press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Later, upon {{visiting the}} grave of Graves, Mulder and Scully learn of his suicide {{and the death of}} his <b>{{daughter}}</b> <b>at</b> a young age, a daughter who would be Lauren's age were she still alive. Scully suspects that Graves faked his death, but on consulting the pathologist who examined his body and testing the organs he donated to others it is proved that he indeed died. Lauren meanwhile witnesses a vision at night, including blood appearing in the bathtub, that leads her to believe that Graves was murdered. At her going-away party, Lauren is threatened by Dorlund, who believes she has knowledge of confidential information that could implicate him. Lauren calls Mulder and Scully to her home, but before the agents can get there, two assassins hired by Dorlund arrive to kill her. An invisible force kills both of them, just as Mulder and Scully arrive (with Mulder witnessing the body of one of the assassins being hanged in midair).|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his <b>daughter.</b> <b>At</b> this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E
5|$|Squire Thornhill {{leaves in}} a {{carriage}} with Olivia, whose departure is soon {{reported to the}} rest of the family.

Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham, but continues to live in Thornhill's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his. Olivia flees in a rage and returns home, where she is reunited with her family. Thornhill, now out for revenge, has the vicar arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts.|$|E
5|$|When Torres again {{goes into}} cardiac arrest, Montgomery {{delivers}} her <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> twenty-three weeks's gestation. The baby is initially unable to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in {{and is able}} to revive her. Across the operating room, Torres's condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) commits to her new relationship with resident Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams); Lexie's sister (and series main character) Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo, primary series star) confesses that she was jealous of Torres's pregnancy, which prompts her husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood. Later, as Robbins keeps a vigil by Torres's bedside, the hallucinatory Torres is able to rouse her recovering self. As she regains consciousness, Torres accepts Robbins's proposal.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce had {{requested}} {{that he was}} to be buried with his sister and <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> Stoke Newington, just north of London. However, the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey. The family agreed and, on 3 August 1833, Wilberforce was buried in the north transept, close to his friend William Pitt. The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament, as well as by members of the public. The pallbearers included the Duke of Gloucester, the Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham and the Speaker of the House of Commons Charles Manners-Sutton.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased <b>daughter</b> (<b>at</b> a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, {{suggested}} that she marry their sister Alice's widower, Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse, who had lost his wife to diphtheria in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was disappointed that the bill had failed, she was happy to keep her <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> her side.|$|E

5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled {{assassination}} attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{appears in}} the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley.

Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a {{lingerie}} model. However, the two later go on to begin a friendship and then a romance. Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback). When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital. Izzie reveals while treating a pregnant teenager {{that she had a}} <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> the age of 16 and gave up for adoption. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD wire to move him up the donor register. Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies. Izzie is the sole beneficiary of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7million. She uses the money to open a free clinic at the hospital: the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her <b>daughter</b> <b>at</b> work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E
