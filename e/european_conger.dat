2500|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{are only}} an occasionally {{contributor to the}} diet in many regions. Most of the 30 or so species recorded have been taken as supplemental prey in Spain, i.e. several lizards (including geckos), frogs and toads, snakes and, to a lesser degree, turtles. One species widely and commonly reported in Europe outside of the Iberian region is the [...] common frog (Rana temporaria). It was the leading prey, making up 45% of the prey found at nests in Rogaland, Norway. Also, the common frog was the second most abundant prey species in studies from southern Sweden, Valais and Engadin in Switzerland, Verbano-Cusi-Ossola, Italy and an enormous study from Slovakia, in the latter 10,476 frogs recorded making up 28.2% of the prey. There are no records of vicious fights between snakes and Eurasian eagle-owls as there are with the great horned owl, with the horned owl sometimes losing its life after attacking a snake. Perhaps with their larger size and greater power, the eagle-owl can more easily overpower any snakes they encounter, although most snakes in Europe and temperate Asia are not particularly large. Like the golden eagle, the eagle-owl may attack spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). In Lebanon, a “large adult” tortoise, which {{would be at least}} as heavy as the eagle-owl itself, was among their food items, although how they handle and eat this large, hard-shelled prey is not clear. Eurasian eagle-owls also opportunistically prey on fish, although never in large numbers, as fish are likely to be taken incidentally while hunting for other prey such as water birds. This species is known to take a greater diversity of fish (more than 30 species verified) and is more widely reported to hunt them than the great horned owl. Most of the fish recorded are medium-sized, with at least 10 each of various kinds of carp or cod, but several species averaging more than [...] in mature mass have been taken, including common barbell (Barbus barbus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), northern pike (Esox lucius) and a few species of trout, even bigger marine predators like the anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and <b>European</b> <b>conger</b> (Conger conger). However, in many cases small, young specimens may be caught of these large fish species rather than full-grown adults. Several species of insect and invertebrate have been identified in eagle-owl pellets. In some cases, these may be undigested insects in the stomachs of birds eaten by the eagle-owl but Eurasian eagle-owls have been verified as actively hunting insects and aquatic invertebrates such as snails and crabs before. Especially diverse in the diet are ground-based beetles, at least 20 species have been identified mainly those in the Carabus (ground beetle) genus.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{preliminary}} knowledge about the threat to marine ecosystems due to leakage of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and other pollutants from rusting bombshells on the seabed, a case {{study was conducted in}} a dumping area in the southern Adriatic Sea (depth 200 – 300 m). Following electroacoustic and magnetometric surveys of the CWA dumping area, an integrated ecotoxicological approach was used. This approach was based on analysis of CWA residues and their metabolites, including arsenic, in sediment and organisms, as well as multimarker methodology including the Health Assessment Index, histological lesion analysis and enzyme assays. Two sentinel species were selected, the blackbelly rosefish [Helicolenus dactylopterus (Delaroche, 1809) ] and the <b>European</b> <b>conger</b> (Conger conger L., 1758). Sediment analysis revealed the presence of CWA degradation products, including 1 - 4 -thioxane and 1 - 4 -dithiane. Tissues of fish from the CWA dumping site showed higher levels of arsenic than those from the reference site. Neither CWAs nor their metabolites were detected in fish tissues. Arsenic levels recorded in blackbelly rosefish were well above those reported for other fish species from the southern Adriatic, much higher than the FDA limit for food (2. 6 mg kg 1) and close to the LD 50 calculated for mammals (20 mg kg 1 body weight). The presence of pollutants in the CWA dumping site was also confirmed by pathological lesions in both species and EROD activity, two to three times higher than in fish from the reference site (16. 45 ± 8. 08 and 8. 05 ± 5. 87 pmol min 1 mg protein 1 in blackbelly rosefish and 269 ± 24. 92 and 78. 71 pmol min 1 mg protein 1 in <b>European</b> <b>conger,</b> respectively). Cholinesterase activity seemed unaffected in muscle of both species, whereas in brain they were one-third of those recorded in fish from the reference site (14. 22 ± 10. 05 and 72. 87 nmol min 1 mg protein 1, respectively). This suggests that acetylcholinesterase is sensitive to CWAs. In conclusion, the agreement of all the chemical and biological parameters investigated suggests that the integrated ecotoxicological approach used is appropriate to reveal the presence and biological effects of CWAs in the marine ecosystem...|$|E

Additionally, comparisons of element:Ca ratios (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Mn:Ca and Mg:Ca) in otolith cores (larval phase) and edges (3 months prior to capture) among the Azores, North Portugal, Madeira and Mallorca regions for 2 years indicated that variation among regions were greater for edges than cores. Therefore, while benthic conger may display residency at regional scales, recruitment {{may not necessarily be}} derived from local spawning and larval retention. Furthermore, data from otoliths suggest a separated replenishment source for western Mediterranean and NE Atlantic stocks.

40|$|Abstract Otolith {{microstructure}} {{and chemical}} composi-tion (Sr:Ca ratios) of the <b>European</b> <b>conger</b> eel (Conger conger) were examined during the larval developmental stages by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and wavelength dispersive spectrometer. Back-calculated hatching dates from the otolith microstructure of the developing leptocephali indicate a protracted spawning season from December to June. The early age of our developing specimens captured south of the Azores Islands suggests that the conger eel has another spawning area closer to Azores than the Mediterranean. Otolith increment width, which was relatively constant and narrow in the developing leptocephalus stage, increased sharply at age 170 – 250 days. Sr:Ca ratios in the otolith, which increased during the developing leptocephalus stage, showed a rapid drop coinciding {{with the increase in}} increment width. These coincidental changes were regarded as the onset of metamorphosis for this species. A close linear relationship between the age at meta-morphosis and otolith growth rate indicates that the faster-growing larvae metamorphose earlier, suggesting that somatic growth should {{play an important role in}} the timing of metamorphosis. As shown in earlier work, the existence of an otolith marginal zone with unclear rings during metamorphosis prevents an accurate estimate of the larval stage duration of this species...|$|E

A total of 11 173 specimens of 224 different fauna taxa and 12 phyla were recorded. Natural reefs had the highest density of specimens (35 122 / 1000 m²) followed by the shipwreck (21 392 / 1000 m²) and the sandy bottoms (3771 / 1000 m²). Three biodiversity indices were estimated (Margalef, Shannon-Wiener and Pielou), with the natural reefs showing the highest values. However, the shipwreck presented values relatively {{similar to those of the}} natural reefs for the Shannon-Wiener and Pielou indices. The three habitats were clearly distinguishable by multivariate statistical analysis, with the average dissimilarity between sand and shipwreck, and between sand and natural reefs being much higher than that between the shipwreck and the natural reefs. The shipwreck had higher abundances of some commercially important species, such as the pouting Trisopterus luscus, <b>European</b> <b>conger</b> Conger conger, and common spider crab Maja squinado, as well as some vulnerable and threatened species such as the pink seafan Eunicella verrucosa.

40|$|Mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), {{and lead}} (Pb) were {{quantified}} in muscle tissue of 5 species of demersal fish (<b>european</b> <b>conger</b> eel, rosefish, brown ray, blackbellied angler, and red mullet) commonly consumed in Italy. In all species studied, Hg {{was the most}} abundant element, followed by Pb and Cd, which exhibited comparable levels. Cd and Pb concentrations did not differ either within individuals {{of the same species}} or among various species examined, whereas Hg accumulation was species-specific. Significant positive correlations between Hg concentrations and fish length for the 5 characterized species were observed. From a public health standpoint, Pb concentrations were under the legal limit for human consumption indicated by European Regulation, whereas Hg and Cd content occurred at levels exceeding the respective critical values in most of the samples examined. The estimated weekly intakes (EWIs) as well as the target hazard quotients (THQs) for Cd and Pb indicated that fish were safe for human consumption, whereas major concern was related to Hg. Fish size-related changes in Hg concentrations determined high THQ and EWI values relatively to larger size fish consumption of these species, except for red mullet, suggesting potential health human risk. A continuous surveillance system of Hg content in fishery products, especially in certain species that for physiological reasons concentrate Hg more easily than others is crucial for consumer health protection...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 An {{experimental}} crustacean {{bottom trawling}} survey targeting the {{deep-water rose shrimp}} Parapenaeus longirostris was carried out off the south of Portugal over five 24 -hour cycles. Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of rose shrimp. The rose shrimp, shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; monkfish, Lophius budegassa; <b>european</b> <b>conger,</b> Conger conger; and great forkbeard, Phycis blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked. The exceptions are: silver scabbardfish, Lepidopus caudatus; blue Whiting, Micromesistius poutassou; tongue sole, Symphurus nigrescens; atlantic mackarel Scomber scombrus and silver cod, Gadiculus argenteus; whose catches were higher in the night hours. Understanding, the circadian variability in catches of highly valuable commercial species such as the deep-water rose shrimp may contribute to an improved management, by allowing a better control of fishing effort and more efficient use of technical measure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Gulf of Lions ecosystemwas {{described}} {{using the}} Ecopath mass-balancemodel to characterise its structure and functioning {{and to examine}} the effects of themultispecific fisheries operating in this area. The model is composed of 40 compartments, including 1 group of seabirds, 2 groups of cetaceans, 18 groups of fish, 12 groups of invertebrates, 5 groups of primary producers, detritus and discards. Input datawere based on several recurrent scientific surveys, two alternative datasets for fishing data, stock assessment outputs, stomach content analyses and published information. Results showed that the functional groups were organised into five trophic levels with the highest one represented by dolphins, anglerfish, Atlantic bluefin tuna, European hake and <b>European</b> <b>conger.</b> European pilchard and European anchovy dominated in terms of fish biomass and catch. Other fish with high biomass such as Atlantic mackerel and blue whiting were highly important in the food web. Seabirds, dolphins and cuttlefish-squids represented keystone species. Important coupled pelagic-demersal-benthic interactions were described. The 7 different fisheries analysed were operating at mean trophic levels situated between 2. 6 for small artisanal boats, and 4. 1 for purse seines (> 24 m) targeting large pelagic fish, indicating an intensively exploited ecosystem. Large trawlers (24 - 40 m) had the highest impact on most of the groups considered; while purse seines (12 - 24 m) targeting small pelagic fish had the lowest impact. Preliminary results highlighted the importance of data sources for further ecosystem and fisheries analyses and management scenarios...|$|E
