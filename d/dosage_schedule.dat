5000|$|The {{main goal}} of a dose-ranging study is to {{estimate}} the response vs. dose given, so as to analyze the efficacy and safety of the drug. Although such a response will nevertheless be available from phase III or phase IV trials, {{it is important to}} carry out dose-ranging studies in the earlier phase I or phase II stages. There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a steady-state condition showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. The main reasons for this is to avoid trials in the later phases using doses that are significantly different from those that will subsequently be recommended for clinical use and also to avoid the need for modification of dosing schedules at later stages where a large amount of data has already been accumulated for a different dose range.The duration of action should be determined during dose-ranging study, as it will allow definition of the <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule.</b> Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, {{it is difficult to determine}} the duration of action during early clinical trials. Other parameters instead are suggested as a tentative dosage, such as half-lives in plasma and urine in various test species and human, receptor binding in vitro, or pharmacodynamic data in vivo in animals.|$|E
40|$|Blood {{quinidine}} levels {{obtained by}} single and multiple <b>dosage</b> <b>schedules</b> of all available quinidine preparations were ascertained. A maintenance blood level of 4 to 7 mg. /l. of quinidine {{was considered a}} desirable range to prevent recurrence of auricular fibrillation in patients previously converted to sinus rhythm. Quinidine sulfate, quinidine gluconate, dihydroquinidine gluconate and quinidine polygalacturonate were given in <b>dosage</b> <b>schedules</b> of one tablet (equivalent to 200 mg. quinidine) every eight hours for four days, then two tablets every eight hours for three days. Blood quinidine levels were determined the same time each day. Schedules of two tablets of quinidine sulfate or quinidine gluconate every eight hours resulted in blood levels between 4 and 7 mg. /l. Similar <b>dosage</b> <b>schedules</b> of the other preparations did not produce levels of this order, nor did quinidine polygalacturonate administered in a 12 -hourly schedule. Serious respiratory arrest occurred in one case following quinidine sulfate. No other toxic reactions were noted in this study...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of amikacin administered intravenously at currently {{recommended doses}} (7. 5 mg/kg every 12 h for infants {{with less than}} 7 days of life; 7. 5 mg/kg every 8 h for infants with greater than 7 days of life) were studied in 28 preterm infants weighing less than 2, 500 g (mean +/- standard deviation, 1. 38 +/- 0. 47 kg; postconceptional age, 30. 50 +/- 2. 86 weeks). The medication was infused over 45 min. Trough and peak serum samples {{as well as two}} additional samples were taken at steady state. The results showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between half-life (8. 42 +/- 2. 55 h) and postconceptional age (P = 0. 002) and a direct correlation between total body clearance (0. 84 +/- 0. 28 ml/min per kg) and postconceptional age (P = 0. 02). These pharmacokinetic data were used to calculate a new <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule</b> for preterm infants. The derived intravenous dosage of amikacin for infants of less than 30 weeks of postconceptional age was 9 mg/kg every 18 h. For infants of greater than 30 weeks of postconceptional age, the dosage was 9 mg/kg every 12 h. Peak and trough levels of amikacin in serum that fell within the therapeutic range were compared by using the currently recommended <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule</b> and the <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule</b> derived from our pharmacokinetic data. There was a {{reduction in the number of}} peak and trough levels that fell outside the accepted therapeutic range which was not statistically significant. Extension of the dosing interval and a further increase in the dosage may result in further improvement. Based on these data, the current recommendations are inadequate for the preterm infant. Our derived <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule</b> improved but did not eliminate high trough and low peak levels of amikacin in all infants. The current recommendations should be adjusted for the preterm infant. Ongoing therapeutic drug monitoring is essential to tailor the amikacin dosage to the individual patient...|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of doctor, patient, and consultation interaction patterns to compliance with antibiotic treatment was examined in 233 adult patients seen in general practice. Twelve variables {{were shown to}} discriminate between compliers and non-compliers. Discriminating variables relating to patients included health state, employment state, knowledge of tablet, and perception of anxiety level, difficulty in complying, and their observed anger, distance, and assertiveness in the consultation. Discriminating variables relating to doctors included provision of advice on duration of treatment, complexity of <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule,</b> age of doctor, and number of years in practice. For the most part these results confirmed previous research. It is concluded that the doctor should consider both the <b>dosage</b> <b>schedule</b> and the patient's daily routine when prescribing antibiotic tablets. Advice on how to take the tablets should be given in specific rather than in general terms. The significant effect {{of the age of}} the doctor and the years spent in practice has not been found in previous work.
