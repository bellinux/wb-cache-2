6000|$|These sombre meditations hardly {{represent}} Diderot's habitual vein; {{they are}} rather a reaction and a {{relief from the}} busy intensity with which he watches the scene, and is constantly putting interrogatories to human life, as day by day its motley circumstance passes before his eyes. We should scarcely suspect from his frequent repetitions of the mournful eternal chorus of the nullity of man and the vanity {{of all the things}} that are under the sun, how alert a watch he kept on incident and character, with what keen and open ear he listened for any curious note of pain, or voice of fine emotion, or odd perversity of fate. All this he does, not in the <b>hard</b> <b>temper</b> of a Balzac, not with the calm or pride of a Goethe, but with an overflowing fulness of spontaneous and uncontrollable sympathy. He is a sentimentalist in the rationalistic century, not with the sentimentalism of misanthropy, such as fired or soured Rousseau, but social, large-hearted, many-sided, careless of the wise rigours of morality. He is never callous nor neutral; on the contrary, he is always approving or disapproving, but not from the standards of the ethical text-books. The casuistry of feeling is of everlasting interest to him, and he is never tired of inventing imaginary cases, or pondering real ones, in which pliant feeling is invoked against the narrowness of duty. These are mostly in a kind of matter which modern taste hardly allows us to reproduce; nor, after all, is there much to be gained by turning the sanctities of human relationship, with all their immeasurable bliss, their immeasurable woe, into the playthings of an idle dialectic. It is pleasanter, and for us English not less instructive than pleasant, to see this dreaming, restless, thrice ingenious spirit, half Titan of the skies, half gnome of the lower earth, entering joyously or pitifully into the simple charm and natural tenderness of life as it comes and passes. Nothing delights him more than to hear or to tell such a story as this of Madame D'Epinay. She had given a small lad eighteen sous for a day's work. At night he went home without a farthing. When his mother asked him whether they had given him nothing for his work, he said No. The mother found out that this was untrue, and insisted on knowing what had become of the eighteen sous. The poor little creature had given them to an alehouse-keeper, where his father had been drinking all day; and so he had spared the worthy man a rough scene with his wife when he got home.[207] ...|$|E

Recently, vaporizing foil actuators (VFA) have been applied toward a variety of impulse-based metalworking operations such as collision welding, closed-die forming, embossing, and shearing. To better apply VFA to different purposes, it is necessary to develop an understanding of how variations on the characteristics of the foil actuator affect its mechanical impulse generation. In this work, actuators made out of 0. 0508, 0. 0762, and 0. 127 mm thick full <b>hard</b> <b>temper</b> AA 1145 foil were used to launch 0. 508 mm thick AA 2024 -T 3 sheets toward a photonic Doppler velocimeter (PDV) probe.

40|$|The {{current work}} investigates {{the effect of}} warm forming process {{parameters}} on springback of AA 3003 brazing sheets, comprising a modified AA 3003 core with a lower melting point AA 4045 clad layer used to promote brazing. Three temper conditions were considered including O-, H 22 - and H 24 -temper. Two custom tooling sets were designed to form U-shaped channels, allowing forming temperature, blank holding force and lubricant type to be varied. The forming temperature range considered was from room temperature to 300 °C. The formed specimen cross sections were measured and the net shape was evaluated {{in terms of the}} measured versus ideal sidewall angle. Tensile tests were conducted to characterize material behaviour for the range of temperature considered in the forming experiments. The results showed thermal softening and increased strain-rate sensitivity at elevated temperature in the O-, H 22 -, and H 24 -tempers, which results in lower forming stresses and thus lower springback. The room temperature strength is recovered after warm forming. Ductility increased significantly at elevated temperature; however, the <b>harder</b> <b>temper</b> conditions exhibited negative strain hardening for high temperatures at strains beyond the ultimate tensile strength. The experiments revealed that springback reduced steadily for all three tempers as the forming temperature was increased from room temperature to 250 °C. The effect of temperature on springback was relatively small for the O-temper condition, but significant for the high-strength tempers. At a forming temperature of 250 °C, the H 22 -and H 24 -tempers exhibited springback reduction of 95 % and 92 %, in terms of deviation from the ideal sidewall angle, relative to springback at room temperature, respectively. The stress-strain data was used to create a numerical model for predicting springback after U-channel forming. One challenge in developing constitutive model parameters for this work was the negative hardening response exhibited by the <b>harder</b> <b>temper</b> conditions at higher temperatures. This caused numerical instabilities, requiring the use of approximate fits to the material response. The sidewall angle deviation and flange angle were predicted after springback. The numerical models qualitatively captured the reduction in springback with increase in forming temperature, but quantitative differences in the predicted and measured extent of springback exist. Sensitivity analysis using the model showed that friction coefficient and constitutive fit had a large influence on predicted springback. Future studies should address the complex material response data at elevated temperature and develop a more detailed temperature- and strain-rate dependent constitutive model...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{reduces the}} {{lifetime}} of {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) superheater tubes more than any other cause. It can be minimized by the careful selection of those materials that are most resistant to corrosion under operating conditions. Since thousands of different materials are already known and many more are developed every year, here the selection methodology developed by Prof. Ashby of the University of Cambridge was used to evaluate the performance of different materials to be used as MSWI superheater tubes. The proposed materials can operate at steam pressures and temperatures over 40 bars and 400 C, respectively. Two case studies are presented: one makes a balanced selection between mechanical properties and cost per thermal unit; and the other focuses on increasing tube lifetime. The balanced selection showed that AISI 410 martensitic stainless steel (wrought, <b>hard</b> <b>tempered)</b> is the best candidate with a good combination of corrosion resistance, a relatively low price (0. 83 - 0. 92 e/kg) and a good thermal conductivity (23 - 27 W/m K).

This poster will present {{the results of the}} characterisation of finds of bolts and sheathing from the 1790 s to the 1840 s using tensile and hardness testing, optical microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and electron backscatter diffraction. In the 1790 s British copper contained a distinctive pattern of arsenic, silver, bismuth and lead impurities, mostly found in the oxide phase as the result of oxidative refining. Tensile and hardness testing show that the copper of the Napoleonic War era was tough, ductile, and consistent in its properties, with bolts being produced with a <b>harder</b> <b>temper</b> as time went on. Although the supply of copper to the navy was operated by a cartel the production of bolts was carried out by three different companies following three different patents. In using electron backscatter diffraction to supplement hardness testing in assessing the effects of cold rolling on the copper it was discovered that one of the patents produced a distinctive crystallographic texture in the metal, the result of drawing the bar through a die. Further research using bolts with makers’ stamps will see whether other attributions can be made, something that cannot be done any other way because the copper is otherwise consistent in both composition and microstructure...|$|R

50|$|If the {{thickness}} of the coating on the edge is balanced just right with the temperature of the water, the proper hardness can be produced without the need for tempering. However, in most cases, the edge will end up being too <b>hard,</b> so <b>tempering</b> the entire blade evenly for a short time is usually required to bring the hardness down to a more suitable point. The ideal hardness is usually between HRc58-60 on the Rockwell hardness scale. Tempering is performed by heating the entire blade evenly to around 400 F, reducing the hardness in the martensite and turning it into a form of tempered martensite. The pearlite, on the other hand, does not respond to tempering, and does not change in hardness.|$|R

Higher-carbon tool steel will remain much <b>harder</b> after <b>tempering</b> than spring steel (of slightly less carbon) when tempered at the same temperature. The oxide film will also increase in thickness over time. Therefore, steel that has been held at 400˚F {{for a very long time}} may turn brown or purple, even though the temperature never exceeded that needed to produce a light straw color. Other factors affecting the final outcome are oil films on the surface and the type of heat source used.|$|R
5000|$|Tempering is a heat {{treatment}} technique applied to ferrous alloys, such as steel or cast iron, to achieve greater toughness by decreasing the hardness of the alloy.

This is also called the lower transformation temperature or lower arrest (A1) temperature; the temperature at which the crystalline phases of the alloy, called ferrite and cementite, begin combining to form a single-phase solid solution referred to as austenite. Heating above this temperature is avoided, so as not to destroy the very-hard, quenched microstructure, called martensite.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Seven improved sorghum hybrids and two commercial hybrids were tempered and steam flaked. The flakes were evaluated for hardness, bulk density, flake durability, in vitro digestibilities, starch properties, and other physical/chemical properties. The flakes from the waxy grain were large, more resistant to breakage, and attractive in appearance. The waxy flakes also had the most unique starch pasting properties. Overall, the waxy flakes had the highest quality. The white food type sorghums produced flakes with superior appearance to commercial red and white sorghums. The floury sorghum produced inferior flakes high in fragility and low in test weight. The hard food type sorghum produced small, uniform flakes that were very <b>hard.</b> <b>Tempering</b> of sorghum reduced the amount of energy used, improved flake strength, reduced dust, improved the appearance of the flakes significantly, and increased the bulk density of flakes for all non waxy sorghums. However, the waxy sorghum flake bulk density decreased slightly with increased tempering moisture. Addition of a selected grain conditioner (< 15 x normal rate) during tempering did not effect pericarp structure and/or increase water absorption by the kernel when viewed with the ESEM. Sulfurous acid and 2 -mercaptoethanol caused significant disruption of the sorghum pericarp and endosperm when viewed with the ESEM. The use of these chemicals could enhance efficiency of the sorghum processing. The in vitro digestibility and enzyme susceptible starch values {{had a great deal of}} variability and there were no significant differences found between flakes prepared from the varieties. The pasting properties of the different sorghum flakes were significantly affected by tempering and endosperm type. This suggests that it may be possible to utilize starch viscosity changes to monitor steam flaking.

5000|$|Metals can be {{heat-treated}} {{to alter}} the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness and/or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation strengthening, quenching, and tempering. The annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged {{so that when the}} metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. Quenching is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after heating, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the steel's molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder.
