25|$|Monster Eats Machine (October 8, 1967) – A {{prototype}} {{version of}} Cookie Monster (performed by Jim Henson) finds a talking machine (voiced by Jim Henson) and eats {{it while it}} explains its various parts. After the monster is done eating the machine, its voice is heard from within the monster as it states that nothing can stop it from performing its function {{which is to be}} the most powerful exploding device <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man.</b> On a related note with this sketch, the prototype version of Cookie Monster was previously used as the Wheel-Stealer from the commercial for Wheels, Crowns, and Flutes. The sketch later appeared on The Muppet Show where the Luncheon Counter Monster also ate a machine explaining its functions.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers made {{comparison}} with Nobuo Uematsu's Final Fantasy compositions, though the soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. Chudah's Corner summarized its review {{by stating that}} the soundtrack is an [...] "astoundingly memorable classic of videogame music". This is also supported by other professional reviews, such as by an RPGFan reviewer that [...] "don't believe that any other soundtrack <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man</b> surpasses it", and a VGM World review who quotes that [...] "the orchestral music is beautiful nonetheless".|$|E
500|$|The Final Fantasy Tactics Original Soundtrack reached #62 on the Japan Oricon {{charts and}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, who says [...] "It {{is the best}} soundtrack I own, and I don't believe that any other soundtrack <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man</b> surpasses it yet as a whole." [...] Ryan of Square Enix Music Online praised {{the way that the}} two composers' pieces blended together, and termed the album [...] "one of the greatest soundtracks ever made and a true work of inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{references}} to the Cure and their music {{have been made in}} popular culture. A number of films have used the title of a Cure song as the film's title, including Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Just Like Heaven (2005). The Cure's gloomy image {{has been the subject of}} parody at times. In series two of The Mighty Boosh, the Moon sings [...] "The Love Cats" [...] over the credits. In the same episode, a powerful gothic hairspray, Goth Juice, is said to be [...] "the most powerful hairspray <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man.</b> Made from the tears of Robert Smith." [...] The Mary Whitehouse Experience often featured brief clips of the stars of the show performing comical songs and nursery rhymes as the Cure in a morose style. Robert Smith appeared in the final episode of the second series of The Mary Whitehouse Experience singing [...] "The sun has got his hat on" [...] before punching the character Ray (played by Robert Newman) whilst uttering Ray's catchphrase [...] "Oh no, what a personal disaster". While not a parody, Robert Smith was the inspiration for the lead character of the film This Must Be the Place. Robert Smith was also portrayed on the South Park episode [...] "Mecha-Streisand" [...] (for which he himself provided the voice-over), where he transforms into the form of Mothra and battles Mecha-Streisand to save the day. As Smith leaves, the character of Kyle shouts, [...] "Disintegration is the best album ever!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Iggy Pop, Bowie's celebrated riff on [...] "Lust for Life" [...] was {{inspired}} by the morse code opening to the American Forces Network News in Berlin. At various points in the song the melody is doubled by the entire band; in Carlos Alomar's words, [...] "You can't play a counter-rhythm to that, you just had to follow". Joy Division and New Order drummer Stephen Morris declared, [...] "On Lust for Life the drums sound not huge but massive! The loudest cymbals <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man,</b> that riff! I wanted to sound like that, still do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1986, the DEA {{administrator}} initiated public hearings on cannabis rescheduling. The hearings lasted two years, involving many witnesses and {{thousands of pages of}} documentation. On September 6, 1988, DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young ruled that cannabis did not meet the legal criteria of a Schedule I prohibited drug and should be reclassified. He declared that cannabis in its natural form is [...] "one of the safest therapeutically active substances <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man.</b> (T)he provisions of the (Controlled Substances) Act permit and require the transfer of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II".|$|E

"That thought {{has never}} {{occurred}} to me," [...] replied Betty, [...] "because our reason for going forth to preach the Gospel to the heathen is the simple one that God commands us to do so. Yet {{it seems to me}} quite consistent with that command that God may have other ways and methods of making His truth <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> but this being a mere speculation does not free us from our simple duty." ...|$|R

In late 2011 Yanni remarked that he tends to prefer instrumental music [...] "because it's more open, but the human voice too {{can be the most}} expressive instrument <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man.</b> There is power to it." [...] Referring to his creative experiences on the 2009 Voices project, Yanni explained that [...] "while most of the music I write is instrumental, I love to use the human voice as another instrument." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of his double-talk routines, Carl Reiner said, [...] "His {{ability to}} doubletalk every {{language}} <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man</b> was impeccable," [...] and during one performance Caesar imitated four different languages but {{with almost no}} real words. Despite his apparent fluency in many languages, Caesar could actually speak only English and Yiddish. In 2008, Caesar told a USA Today reporter, [...] "Every language has its own music ... If you listen to a language for 15 minutes, you know the rhythm and song." [...] Having developed this mimicry skill, he could create entire monologues using gibberish in numerous languages, {{as he did in}} a skit in which he played a German general.|$|E
2500|$|During Congressional {{debate in}} [...] 1820 on the {{proposed}} Tallmadge Amendment, which sought to limit slavery in Missouri as it became a state, Rufus King declared that [...] "laws or compacts imposing any such condition [...] upon any human being are absolutely void, because contrary {{to the law of}} nature, which is the law of God, by which he makes his ways <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man,</b> and is paramount to all human control." [...] The amendment failed and Missouri became a slave state. According to historian David Brion Davis, this may have been {{the first time in the}} world that a political leader openly attacked slavery's perceived legality in such a radical manner.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{original}} works was On the Letters (О писмєньхъ) by Chernorizets Hrabar, where he defended the Cyrillic alphabet against its Byzantine Greek critics and proved not only its right to existence but also its superiority to the Greek alphabet arguing that the Greek letters were neither the oldest <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man,</b> nor divine. In the form of rhetoric questions and answers On the Letters demonstrated excellent historic and linguistic knowledge of Chernorizets Hrabar, as he indicated that [...] "God did not first create the Hebrew or the Greek language, but Syrian which Adam spoke..." [...] and underlined that [...] "Before then the Greeks had no alphabet of their own but wrote their speech with Phoenician letters." [...] Constantine of Preslav and John the Exarch combined translated and adapted Byzantine works with original texts. The latter compiled the Shestodnev (Шестоднев – Hexameron) that included valuable first-hand evidence about the Bulgarian Empire under Simeon I. Constantine of Preslav's Didactic Gospel was the first systematic work treating sermons in Slavic literature that also featured the poetic preface Azbuchna molitva (Азбучна молитва – Alphabet Prayer), the first original poetry in Bulgarian language. Later, Cosmas the Priest wrote the anti-Bogomil treatise Sermon Against the Heretics which apart from the theological arguments contained criticism on the contemporary Bulgarian society, with particular attention to religious and social issues.|$|E

5000|$|As with a {{large part}} of India, a {{traditional}} duality existed in script usage between Devanagari by religiously educated people (most notably Brahmins) and Modi for common usage among administrators, businesspeople, and others. As observed in 1807, [...] Although in the Mahratta country the Devanagari character is well <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>men</b> of education, yet a character is current among the men of business which is much smaller, and varies considerably in form from the Nagari, though the number and power of the letters nearly correspond.|$|R
50|$|To better {{understand}} and comprehend the truths of a science, men have created textbooks (Lehrbuch), {{which of course}} contain only the true propositions of the science <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>men.</b> But how <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where <b>to</b> divide our knowledge, that is, which truths belong together? Bolzano explains that we will ultimately know this through some reflection, but that the resulting rules of how to divide our knowledge into sciences will be a science in itself. This science, that tells us which truths belong together and should be explained in a textbook, is the Theory of Science (Wissenschaftslehre).|$|R

Blessed shore, {{of such a}} sea of Aristocrat blood: but how to land on it? Through one last wave: blood of corrupt Sansculottists; traitorous or semi-traitorous Conventionals, rebellious Talliens, Billauds, to whom with my Etre Supreme I have become a bore; with my Apocalyptic Old Woman a laughing-stock!--So stalks he, this poor Robespierre, like a seagreen ghost through the blooming July.

6000|$|... [EN#5] The Saturday Review, in a courteous {{notice of}} my first volume (May 25, 1878), has the {{following}} remarks:--"The Arabs talk of some (?) Nazarenes, and a 'King of the Franks,' having built the stone huts and the tombs in a neighbouring cemetery ('Aynúnah). But {{there can be no}} local tradition worth repeating in this instance." [...] Here we differ completely; and those will agree with me who know how immutable and, in certain cases, imperishable Arab tradition is. The reviewer, true, speaks of North Midian, where all the tribes, except the Beni 'Ukbah, are new. Yet legend can survive the destruction and disappearance of a race: witness the folk-traditions of the North-Eastern Italians and the adjacent Slavs. Here, however, in South Midian we have an ancient race, the Baliyy. And what strengthens the Christian legend is that it is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man,</b> woman, and child throughout the length and breadth of the land.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the lesser}} {{annoyances}} to which Thomson was subjected in Africa was {{the presence of}} rats in the night-time, which he had to brush away like flies.

Yet though he and the two other travellers mentioned (doubtless they are not alone in this) have put up cheerfully with almost every hardship <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>man,</b> this does not make them indifferent to the comforts of civilization when they return home.
