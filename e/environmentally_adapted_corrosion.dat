40|$|The {{lubricants}} of {{the future}} {{have to be more}} <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted,</b> have a higher level of performance, and lower total life cycle cost (LCC) than commonly used lubricants today. Since we live on a planet with finite resources, {{we have to think about}} coming generations and work for a sustainable development in the field of tribology. To be able to formulate those lubricants, the properties of the base fluids have to be well known. Base fluid properties that influence the formulated lubricant performance could be divided in to three different groups. These groups are; physical, chemical and film formation properties. In this study are properties from all of these groups investigated to improve the understanding on there influence on base fluid overall performance. There are more or less <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> base fluids available for formulation of lubricants. They could be divided in to different groups, mineral, semi synthetic and synthetic fluids. Synthetic fluids could be of different type: PAO (poly alpha olefins), Synthetic ester, Poly glycols and others. The most interesting group for formulation of <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> lubricants are the synthetic esters. In this thesis the properties for a large number of <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> ester base fluids are studied in detail. The tested properties relate to the macroscopic / molecular behaviour and include: viscosity-temperature-pressure-effects, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity per unit volume. The film formation capability in EHD contacts is also studied. Different connections between the molecular structure and the performance for the fluids are discussed. As an example, it is found that a large number of carboxylate groups in the ester molecule are improving the thermal properties, and thereby a thicker lubricating film could be maintained in highly loaded, high slip contacts.

This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in slow sliding journal bearings with shaft oscillation as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different lubricated <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional lubricated tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that synthetic esters affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil. The synthetic esters were also sensitive to the selection of bearing and shaft material. Highly alloyed bronzes were more prone to corrosive wear. A coated shaft showed excellent performance with a low alloyed tin bronze. The comparison of self lubricated bearings with water lubrication to an EAL lubricated tin bronze on stainless steel showed large performance differences between the water lubricated materials. They showed both better and worse friction and wear results than the EAL lubricated tin bronze. The oscillating pin on disc can generate similar contact mechanisms as in a journal bearing. The most important conclusion of this work {{is that it is}} possible to find self lubricated journal bearings better suited for shaft oscillation than EAL lubricated bronze bearings in water turbine application. Water lubricated design of the bearings are the most <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> solution.

40|$|Five {{distinct}} cryptic lineages (clades I-V) {{have recently}} been recognized in the Escherichia genus. The five clades encompass strains that are phenotypically and taxonomically indistinguishable from Escherichia coli sensu stricto; however, scant data are available on their ecology, virulence and pathogenic properties. In this study 20 cryptic E. coli strains isolated from marine sediments were investigated to gain insights into their virulence characteristics and genetic traits. The ability to adhere to intestinal cells was highest among clade V strains, which also harbored the genes involved in gut colonization {{as well as the}} genes (pduC and eut operon) typically found in <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> E. coli strains. The pduC gene was significantly associated with clade V. Multilocus sequence typing of three representative clade V isolates revealed new sequence types (STs) and showed that the strains shared two allelic loci (adk 51 and recA 37). Our findings suggest that cryptic Escherichia lineages are common in coastal marine sediments and that this habitat may be suitable for their growth and persistence outside the host. On the other hand, detection in clade V strains of a gene repertoire and adhesion properties similar to those of intestinal pathogenic strains could indicate their potential virulence. It could be argued that there is a dual nature of cryptic clade V strains, where the ability to survive and persist in a secondary habitat does not involve the loss of the host-associated lifestyle.

40|$|The {{lubricants}} of {{the future}} {{have to be more}} <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted,</b> show a higher level of performance, and give a lower total life cycle cost (LCC) than the lubricants that are used today. One way to be able to produce, choose and formulate these lubricants is to have good knowledge about the properties of the base fluids and their additive response. The base fluid properties can be divided into four different groups, i. e. physical, chemical, film formation properties and additive response. This thesis is based on the results from the Swedish HiMeC research project "Environmentally adapted lubricants for high performance components". A number of different <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> ester fluids, suitable for formulation of <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> lubricants were investigated according to properties, molecular structure and film formation capability. I t was found that both thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are high for the esters compared to mineral fluids. There is a strong correlation between the number of carboxylate groups and the thermal conductivity. The film formation capability was investigated by the use of optical interferometry in a ball and disc apparatus. A new model for measuring the running in performance of mechanical components was developed. The tests are run un-accelerated, with the same contact pressure and speed as the real applications they represent. The method is based on a tribotest and exact measurement of the surface topography at the exact same spot before and after the test. The most interesting parameters to monitor were found to be Rdq and Rpk. It was found that even very small changes at the uppermost parts of the topography can be measured and monitored whit this method. The additive response for both traditional anti wear additives and specially designed more polar additives where studied. The test where performed at Iwate University in Japan. A modified Falex pin and vee block tribotest machine where used. It was found that the new type of additives is efficient but {{further research is needed to}} be able to formulate fluid based on this chemistry. When putting all together, it could be seen that it will be possible to tailor make base fluids with suitable properties and additivate them with the correct additives for the task they should perform. That will make it possible to achieve better results than the fluids used to day in both environmental and performance aspects. Godkänd; 2006; 20070315 (evan...|$|R

Methods and Results: A BF method was used to type 3952 enterococci isolates from six catchments. The environmental isolates were compared with a large existing BF library comprised of 5803 enterococci isolates from 10 host groups. Environmental isolates belonged to 801 biochemical phenotypes (BPTs), of which, an average of 29. 2 % was specific to each catchment. When compared with the BF library, an average of 79 · 5 % BPTs from each catchment was identical to those in the library (i. e. host-origin BPTs). The remaining 20 · 5 % was regarded as non-host origin BPTs, as they were not in the library and constituted only 5 · 3 % of the total isolates tested for each catchment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that less than 5 % of studied environmental strains was not identical to those in the library and seemed to be of environmental origin. From a microbial source tracking context, such low level of <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> strains can have a minimal impact on the performance of the library-based methods if a large number of isolates were tested from both the host groups and environmental waters.

40|$|Small {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (sHsps) maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing stress and disease-induced protein aggregation. While {{it is known}} that hydrophobicity impacts the ability of sHsps to bind aggregation-prone denaturing proteins, the complex quaternary structure of globular sHsps has made understanding the significance of specific changes in hydrophobicity difficult. Here we used recombinant protein of the lenticular sHsp a A-crystallin from six teleost fishes <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> to temperatures ranging from- 2 uC to 40 uC to identify correlations between physiological temperature, protein stability and chaperone-like activity. Using sequence and structural modeling analysis we identified specific amino acid differences between the warm adapted zebrafish and cold adapted Antarctic toothfish that could contribute to these correlations and validated the functional consequences of three specific hydrophobicity-altering amino acid substitutions in aA-crystallin. Site directed mutagenesis of three residues in the zebrafish (V 62 T, C 143 S, T 147 V) confirmed that each impacts either protein stability or chaperone-like activity or both, with the V 62 T substitution having the greatest impact. Our results indicate a role for changing hydrophobicity in the thermal adaptation of a A-crystallin and suggest ways to produce sHsp variants with altered chaperone-like activity. These data also demonstrate that a comparativ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is a {{promising}} methodology, {{intended for the}} autonomous development of robots, in which their behaviors are obtained {{as a consequence of}} the structural coupling between robot and environment. It is essential that there be a great amount of interaction to generate complex behaviors. Thus, nowadays, it is common to use simulation to speed up the learning process; however simulations are achieved from arbitrary off-line designs, rather than from the result of embodied cognitive processes. According to the reality gap problem, controllers evolved in simulation usually do not allow the same behavior to arise once transferred to the real robot. Some preliminary approaches for combining simulation and reality exist in the ER literature; nonetheless, there is no satisfactory solution available. In this work we discuss recent advances in neuroscience as a motivation for the use of <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> simulations, which can be achieved through the co-evolution of robot behavior and simulator.

40|$|Defining {{bacterial}} species {{remains a}} challenging problem {{even for the}} model bacterium Escherichia coli and has major practical consequences for reliable diagnosis of infectious disease agents and regulations for transport and possession of organisms of economic importance. E. coli traditionally is thought to live within the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other warm-blooded animals and not to survive for extended periods outside its host; this understanding {{is the basis for}} its widespread use as a fecal contamination indicator. Here, we report the genome sequences of nine <b>environmentally</b> <b>adapted</b> strains that are phenotypically and taxonomically indistinguishable from typical E. coli (commensal or pathogenic). We find, however, that the commensal genomes encode for more functions that are important for fitness in the human gut, do not exchange genetic material with their environmental counterparts, and hence do not evolve according to the recently proposed fragmented speciation model. These findings are consistent with a more stringent and ecologic definition for bacterial species than the current definition and provide means to start replacing traditional approaches of defining distinctive phenotypes for new species with omics-based procedures. They also have important implications for reliable diagnosis and regulation of pathogenic E. coli and for the coliform cell-counting test...|$|R
