25|$|Ondine {{is not a}} {{classical}} construction with great set pieces (except for the wedding divertissement in the third act) or grand formal pas de deux, but a continuous, flowing narrative. However, this narrative is itself not very strong {{and there is no}} real explanation of why the lovers are on a ship in Act 2, or what exactly has passed between Acts 2 and 3 to convince Palemon to return to his mortal lover, Beatrice (Berta). The work uses classical ballet vocabulary, but the form varies a great deal from the 19th century classics. Unlike them, is through-composed: there are no breaks for bows to the audience built in and (at least until the third-act divertissement) no bravura variations to self-consciously elicit the audience's response. Henze's glittering music is the dominating force, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> score to dance to, with the pulse well hidden within its general sheen, but it is atmospheric and often exciting, bringing the close of Act I to a climax.|$|E

The freedom with which a person can walk about and look around is a very useful guide to the civilized quality of an urban area ... judged against this standard, many of our towns now seem to leave a great deal to be desired ... there must be areas of good environment where people can live, work, shop, look about and move around on foot in reasonable freedom from the hazards of motor traffic.|$|E
2500|$|The berries are {{distinguished}} by their russet color when ripe [...] roux is French for the reddish-brown color russet, and {{is probably the}} root for the variety's name. The aroma of Roussanne is often reminiscent of a flowery herbal tea. [...] In warm climates, it produces wines of richness, with flavors of honey and pear, and full body. [...] In cooler climates it is more floral and more delicate, with higher acidity. [...] In many regions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> variety to grow, with vulnerability to mildew, poor resistance to drought and wind, late and/or uneven ripening, and irregular yields.|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} type of generalization is that in which rook arrangements that are obtained from each other by symmetries of the board are counted as one. [...] For instance, if rotating the board by 90 degrees is allowed as a symmetry, then any arrangement obtained by a rotation of 90, 180, or 270 degrees {{is considered to be}} [...] "the same" [...] as the original pattern, even though these arrangements are counted separately in the original problem where the board is fixed. [...] For such problems, Dudeney observes: [...] "How many ways there are if mere reversals and reflections are not counted as different has not yet been determined; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{model of}} {{rational}} decision-making has also {{proven to be}} very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions. [...] For instance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> model to apply {{in the public sector}} because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings. This latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, who wrote in his book `Understanding Public Policy´ the following passage: ...|$|E
