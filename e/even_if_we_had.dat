500|$|A German {{victory would}} be of greater {{magnitude}} against the Western Allies than it would against the Soviet Union. According to General Alfred Jodl, [...] "The Russians had so many troops that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> succeeded in destroying thirty divisions {{it would have made}} no difference. On the other hand, if we destroyed thirty divisions in the West, it would amount to {{more than a third of}} the whole invasion Army." [...] Hitler believed that inaction in the West would only conclude in an inevitable German defeat. His basic plan involved an early morning breakthrough along the lightly defended sector of the Ardennes Forest, with the eventual task of crossing the Meuse River and capturing Antwerp in order to deny the Western Allies a crucial port.|$|E
500|$|The company touted Cosby's {{education}} and rapport with adults and children. The campaign {{was aimed at}} parents, rather than children, as was the campaign for the Commodore 64. [...] Cosby was {{the face of a}} mystery rebate program, offering reimbursements of between $3 and $1,000. J. Fred Bucy, who was head of Texas Instruments' home computer operation in 1983, scrapped Cosby's advertisements to focus on the product's educational value. Radio Shack vice-president of marketing David Beckerman said, [...] "A celebrity draws attention to the product. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> President Reagan on our ads, we wouldn't sell any more computers. A product sells itself. A celebrity causes indirect sales." [...] Cosby, along with entrepreneur James Bruce Llewellyn, bought stock in a Philadelphia Coca-Cola bottler in 1983 as part of the company's push to increase African American participation in the company. This was, in part, a response to pressure by Jesse Jackson's PUSH campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot using the video mode of two Canon EOS 5D Mark II and one Canon EOS 1D Mark IV digital single-lens reflex cameras, which helped the filmmakers {{look more like}} typical park visitors. To {{compensate}} for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in monochrome mode. [...] "e were shooting with really fast lenses wide open, so our depth of field was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a focus puller," [...] Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. [...] "ecause the 5D doesn't shoot RAW, we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> wanted to." [...] Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.|$|E

2500|$|On a more literal level, Laurent Lebec {{states that}} [...] "I {{had no idea}} where we were going with the music when we started doing these songs [...] he changes were pretty {{subconscious}} at first, then looking back we realized what was happening and we just went with it." [...] He continues to add [...] "when we were touring for our last album, The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a 75-minute-long set, we could only play five songs because they were all so long, and that can be tiring for an audience." [...] They are also intent on making it clear that the album is not simply negative in message. [...] "The title also pays tribute to how amazing touring most often feels. It's also a tribute to the joy that burns inside when you reach a place and people who don't speak your language are rooting for your songs and welcoming you into their unique environment".|$|E
