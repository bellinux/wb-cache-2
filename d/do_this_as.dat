5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Churchill {{bought a}} factory in Griffin Court, Chapel Street, Salford, {{initially}} as a facility to tool up the imported machinery. It {{was not the first}} British company to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> Sharp, Stewart & Co had built American machinery under license since at least 1873.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd was {{concerned}} that German scientists might also attempt this experiment. The German nuclear physicist Siegfried Flügge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939. After discussing this prospect with fellow Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner, they decided that they should warn the Belgians, as the Belgian Congo was the best source of uranium ore. Wigner suggested that Albert Einstein might be a suitable person to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> he knew the Belgian Royal Family.|$|E

5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E

25|$|Due to the devadasi being equated to prostitutes, {{they also}} became {{associated}} with the spreading of venereal disease in India. During the British Colonial period, many British soldiers were exposed to venereal disease in the various brothels being operated at that time. As such, devadasis were misunderstood {{to be responsible for}} this. In efforts to control the spread of venereal disease, the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves, with devadasis being forced to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> well, as they were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.|$|E
25|$|Before {{declining to}} return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his Military Cross into the River Mersey at Formby beach. According to his {{description}} of this incident in Memoirs of an Infantry Officer he did not <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but simply out {{of the need to}} perform some destructive act in catharsis of the black mood which was afflicting him; his account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well.|$|E
25|$|Many large sports {{stores and}} {{specialised}} cricket stores use special machines to knock in the bats for customers. Some manufacturers will roll the bats through a special press to compress the wood, however many bat manufacturers {{choose not to}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> the spring may be rolled as well, causing jarring. Many bats that claim to be pre-knocked-in by the manufacturer should be manually knocked in anyway as this claim is not a guarantee that the bat {{is ready to be}} used in competition.|$|E

25|$|In Chinese folk {{religions}} {{as well as}} {{the aforementioned}} faiths, people often eat vegan on the 1st and 15th of the month, {{as well as the}} eve of Chinese New Year.

The percentage of people permanently being pure vegetarian is about the same as the modern English-speaking world, but this percentage has not really changed for a very long time. Many people eat vegan for {{a certain amount of time}} in order to make up for the belief that they have sinned.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{hardware}} RAID cards, {{perhaps in the}} mistaken belief that these will 'help' ZFS. While routine for other filing systems, ZFS handles RAID natively, and is designed {{to work with a}} raw and unmodified low level view of storage devices, so it can fully use its functionality. A separate RAID card may leave ZFS less efficient and reliable. For example ZFS checksums all data, but most RAID cards will not <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> effectively, or for cached data. Separate cards can also mislead ZFS about the state of data, for example after a crash, or by mis-signalling exactly when data has safely been written, and in some cases this can lead to issues and data loss. Separate cards can also slow down the system, sometimes greatly, by adding latency to every data read/write operation, or by undertaking full rebuilds of damaged arrays where ZFS would have only needed to do minor repairs of a few seconds.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E

25|$|Nomura's father {{influenced}} {{his interest}} in art and games early on, creating little drawings and unique Sugoroku board games for him. Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers would come and bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it surprised him and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura then looked for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied at the video game company Square after he had seen a job advertisement with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E
500|$|According to Hoveden, in May 1186 Henry {{ordered the}} king and magnates of Scotland to subdue Lochlann; in {{response}} Lochlann [...] "collected numerous horse and foot and obstructed the entrances to Galloway and its roads to what extent he could". Richard Oram {{did not believe that}} the Scots really intended to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> Lochlann was their dependent and probably acted with their consent; this, Oram argued, explains why Henry himself raised an army and marched north to Carlisle. When Henry arrived he instructed King William and his brother David, Earl of Huntingdon, to come to Carlisle, and to bring Lochlann with them.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} the Sugababes' fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways, it was announced in December 2005 that founding group member Mutya Buena had left the band. Two singles were subsequently released from the album featuring new group member Amelle Berrabah, who was announced as Buena's replacement 24 hours after her departure. In June 2006, the Sugababes began working on their fifth studio album which was confirmed for release in 2007. However, group member Heidi Range also revealed that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas 2006, which would include all of the group's hits. When rumours arose that {{the release of the}} album was premature, band member Keisha Buchanan stated that the group had already started to plan a greatest hits album. She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena's departure, saying: [...] "When Mutya left, we decided it was even more important, we should <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> closure so we don't have to relive history all the time." [...] Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this, saying: [...] "When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned for this time anyway. But when she left it seemed even more appropriate." ...|$|E

500|$|As the dialogue-integrated [...] "tutorial" [...] in {{the first}} Ace Attorney was well received, the {{inclusion}} of one in Justice for All was considered a [...] "major point". While the first game's tutorial involved Phoenix being helped through his first trial by his mentor Mia and the judge, this {{could not be used}} twice, which led to the idea of giving Phoenix a temporary amnesia from a blow to the head. Takumi included a circus and magic in the game's third episode; he really wanted to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> performing magic is a hobby of his. The episode includes two themes that he wanted to explore: the difficulties in forming a cohesive team with different people, and a person who against the odds tries to make something whole. The former was reflected in how the circus members come together at the end, while the latter was reflected in the character Moe. Several different versions of the fourth episode were created, partially because of them running out of memory on the game's cartridge, but also because of the popularity of the character of Miles Edgeworth: Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes, but when they were in full production the development team learned that the character had become popular, which led to Takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and sparingly. Because of this, he created the character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. The character Pearl Fey was originally intended to be a rival character around the same age as Maya, only appearing in the game's second episode; one of the game's designers suggested that it would be more dramatic if she were much younger, so Takumi wrote her as an eight-year-old. As he ended up liking her, he included her in other episodes as well.|$|E
2500|$|In early April, Pearse issued {{orders to}} the Irish Volunteers for three days of [...] "parades and manoeuvres" [...] {{beginning}} on Easter Sunday.

2500|$|By {{forcing the}} band members out of their {{individual}} comfort zones, the producers were able to change U2's [...] approach to songwriting and playing their instruments.
