5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely.
