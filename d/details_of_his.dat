5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities.

This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E
