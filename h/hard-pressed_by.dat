5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|In 977, as Bakhtiyar {{found himself}} driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned {{again to the}} Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in {{exchange}} for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul. Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but in vain, for Skleros too was <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|Sharon renewed his division's {{attack that}} day, moving north from Serabaeum on a three brigade front, with Matt on the right, Erez in the center, and Reshef on the left. The advance spanned {{the entire area}} between the Suez Canal on {{the east and the}} Sweetwater Canal on the west. By dawn, both Touscan and Ain Ghasin were under attack. The 89th Battalion had {{concentrated}} all its forces at the Touscan strong point, where it was <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> superior Israeli armored and mechanized forces. Azmy reported the situation to Second Army headquarters, and requested permission to detonate a nearby bridge on the Sweetwater Canal and flood the area before the advancing Israelis. Khalil however issued strict orders not to do so, since the canal was a crucial source of drinking water to civilians {{all the way up to}} Suez city. The situation was deteriorating for the paratroopers however, and Azmy soon had the bridge destroyed and broke down sections of nearby irrigation canals, flooding the entire area and submerging Israeli tanks up to their hulls in muddy water. This led to the paratroopers of Matt's brigade spearheading the advance in the center instead, while the armored brigades were forced to have their mechanized infantry push ahead on foot. The Touscan position remained under heavy air and artillery attack, and by midday it was surrounded. Losses due to death and injury left the battalion with some 120 paratroopers still able to fight.|$|E

50|$|The Scythian cavalry {{from the}} Persian left wing opened the battle by {{attempting}} to flank Alexander's extreme right. What followed was a long and fierce cavalry battle between the Persian left and the Macedonian right, in which the latter, being greatly outnumbered, was often <b>hard-pressed.</b> However, <b>by</b> careful use of reserves and disciplined charges, the Greek troops were able to contain their Persian counterparts, which would be vital {{for the success of}} Alexander's decisive attack.|$|R

In the subsequent treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg, John II Casimir confirmed Frederick William I's sovereignty in Prussia after the latter abandoned Sweden in the war.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the war in July 1921, the IRA was <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> the {{deployment}} of more British troops into the most active areas and a chronic shortage of arms and ammunition. It has been estimated that the IRA had only about 3,000 rifles (mostly captured from the British) during the war, with a larger number of shotguns and pistols. An ambitious plan to buy arms from Italy in 1921 collapsed when the money did not reach the arms dealers. Towards {{the end of the}} war, some Thompson submachine guns were imported from the United States; however 450 of these were intercepted by the American authorities and the remainder only reached Ireland shortly before the Truce.|$|E
25|$|To {{the right}} of the Royal Fusiliers, the 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, were equally <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> the German assault on the salient. Greatly outnumbered, both battalions {{suffered}} heavy casualties but with the addition of reinforcements from the Royal Irish Regiment, from the divisional reserve and fire support from the divisional artillery, they managed to hold the bridges. The Germans expanded their attack, assaulting the British defences along the straight reach of the canal {{to the west of the}} salient. The Germans used the cover of fir plantations that lined the northern side of the canal and advanced to within a few hundred yards of the canal, to rake the British with machine-gun and rifle fire. The German attack fell particularly heavily on the 1st Battalion, Royal West Kent Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, which despite many casualties, repulsed the Germans throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Two {{military}} families {{arose from the}} Turkic slave-guards of the Samanid Empire, the Simjurids and Ghaznavids, who ultimately proved disastrous to the Samanids. The Simjurids received an appanage in the Kohistan region of eastern Khorasan. The Samanid generals Alp Tigin and Abu al-Hasan Simjuri competed for the governorship of Khorasan {{and control of the}} Samanid Empire by placing on the throne emirs they could dominate after the death of Abd al-Malik I in 961. His death created a succession crisis between his brothers. A court party instigated by men of the scribal class — civilian ministers rather than Turkic generals — rejected the candidacy of Alp Tigin for the Samanid throne. Mansur I was installed instead, and Alp Tigin prudently retired to south of the Hindu Kush, where he captured Ghazna and became the ruler of the city as a Samanid authority. The Simjurids enjoyed control of Khorasan south of the Amu Darya but were <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> a third great Iranian dynasty, the Buyid dynasty, and were unable to survive the collapse of the Samanids and the subsequent rise of the Ghaznavids.|$|E
50|$|Ketchel fought Sam Langford on April 27, 1910. It was a <b>hard-pressed</b> fight <b>by</b> both men, each {{displaying}} terrific hitting {{power for}} all six {{rounds of the}} short bout. No knock downs were scored and both had plenty {{of energy in the}} end. Langford won by decision. A longer rematch bout was rumored, but never happened. Some disputed the decision, although a majority of people felt that Langford had won the bout, which following a decision-appealing vote, it was decided (in an uncontroversial manner) that it would stand as a decision win for Langford.|$|R

25|$|In {{support of}} the 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions, the 741st, along with a company of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was {{instrumental}} in helping hold the northern shoulder of the Bulge in vicious fighting in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt during the German Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) in December 1944. By now battle-seasoned veterans, tankers from the battalion resisted repeated numerous <b>hard-pressed</b> attacks <b>by</b> spearheading elements of the SS-heavy Sixth Panzer Army from 16–19 December. Facing superior German Panther and Tiger tanks (among others) supported by infantry, the battalion fought many small unit engagements, deftly stalking the German tanks in twos and threes until they could destroy or immobilize them with shots from the flanks or rear. On 19 December, elements of the battalion were the rear guard of an orderly withdrawal from Rocherath-Krinkelt to positions behind Wirtzfeld {{to the west and}} northwest.|$|R
25|$|By late August the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse {{faced the}} Austrian army of Wilhelm von Wartensleben along the Naab River with Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's {{division}} watching its southern flank. Jourdan hoped that Moreau's Army of the Rhine and Moselle would {{pin down the}} Austrians in southern Germany, but this did not occur. On 22–23 August Bernadotte's 6,000 troops were attacked by Archduke Charles with 28,000 Austrians. Jourdan sent Bonnaud's cavalry to help, but events moved too fast and Bernadotte made a fighting retreat northwest to Forchheim. Bonnaud never joined Bernadotte and was beset by superior forces as his troopers fell back toward Jourdan's main army. In order to allow Bonnaud to escape, Jourdan stood to fight and was beaten in the Battle of Amberg on 24 August. In his retreat, Jourdan headed for Würzburg with Bonnaud's cavalry in the lead, but the Austrians got there first. On 2 September, two French divisions and the cavalry were in front of Würzburg though a third division did not appear until the evening. Charles defeated the French in the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September. The Austrians sustained 1,500 casualties while the French lost twice as many plus seven guns. The action began at 7:00 am when the left flank French division under Paul Grenier moved forward only to be attacked by a mass of Austrian cavalry. Wartensleben hurled 24 squadrons of cuirassiers at Grenier, but Bonnaud and the divisional French cavalry fought them off. When 12 additional squadrons of Austrian cuirassiers charged, Bonnaud was defeated and forced to shelter behind the French infantry. Jourdan ordered a withdrawal after being <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> Austrian reinforcements.|$|E
500|$|The summits of {{the five}} volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains. Hawaiians {{associated}} elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the sky father Wākea marries the earth mother Papa, giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands. Kīlauea itself means [...] "spewing" [...] or [...] "much spreading" [...] in Hawaiian, referencing its high state of activity, and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea is {{the body of the}} deity Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. It is here that the conflict between Pele and the rain god Kamapuaa was centered; Halemaumau, [...] "House of the amaumau fern", derives its name from the struggle between the two gods. Kamapuaa, <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> Pele's ability to make lava spout from the ground at will, covered the feature, a favorite residence of the goddess, with fern fronds. Choked by trapped smoke, Pele emerged. Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction, the others gods called a draw and divided the island between them, with Kamapuaa getting the moist windward northeastern side, and Pele directing the drier Kona (or leeward) side. The rusty singed appearance of the young fronds of the amaumau {{is said to be a}} product of the legendary struggle.|$|E
500|$|The Umayyads had conquered most of Transoxiana in {{the early}} years of the 8th century, but had been {{increasingly}} <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> Turgesh attacks and the revolts of the native princes in the 720s. After a major defeat in the Battle of the Defile in 731, most of Transoxiana was lost, while in 734–736 al-Harith ibn Surayj led a major rebellion against the caliphal governors in Khurasan. The appointment of the veteran Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri as governor led to the defeat of Ibn Surayj, but in 737 Asad's attempt to restore control over Khuttal led to a debacle when the Turgesh attacked his army. Although Asad managed to save most of his force, he suffered heavy losses and his army's baggage train was annihilated in the [...] "Battle of the Baggage". Asad withdrew to Balkh, while the Turgesh ruler Suluk, advised by Ibn Surayj, launched a winter invasion of lower Tokharistan. When the Turgesh ruler dispersed his army to raid and gather forage, Asad seized the opportunity to confront him. With 7,000 men he surprised Suluk, who had only about 4,000 troops with him, and defeated him near Kharistan. The Turgesh ruler and Ibn Surayj managed to flee, but his camp fell into Arab hands, and most of the roaming bands of his army were destroyed. This unexpected victory shored up the threatened Umayyad position in Khurasan, while diminishing the prestige of Suluk, who fell victim to inter-Turgesh rivalries in early 738. Asad's successor Nasr ibn Sayyar was able to use the collapse of Turgesh power to restore the Arab position in Transoxiana almost to what it had been before the Turgesh intervention.|$|E
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{different}} social groups get along is a key indicator of the cohesiveness of a society. This study examines perceptions of social cohesion among Europeans and explains variations in those perceptions by considering the separate and combined effects of economic strain and institutional trust. Analyses were conducted with the 27 member countries of the EU based on the Eurobarometer 74. 1 on poverty and social exclusion conducted in 2010. Results show that individuals living in households experiencing economic strain perceive social cohesion to be weaker than their less economically <b>hard-pressed</b> counterparts. <b>By</b> contrast, individuals trusting their political institutions perceived there to be higher levels of cohesion. Furthermore, institutional trust substantially moderates the negative relationship between economic strain and perceptions of cohesion. These results are robust to various model specifications. Moreover, extending the analysis revealed that this moderating effect held when considering social relations between the poor and rich and between different racial and ethnic groups. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{his early}} novels, the Icelandic Nobel laureate Halldór Laxness portrayed troubled {{individuals}} beset by familial, societal and economic challenges within an unpredictable and often unforgiving landscape; his later work addressed humanistic concerns regarding a well-lived {{life and the}} harmony of individual and environment. His 1957 novel The Fish Can Sing lies at the cusp of these preoccupations. Laxness contrasts the economic privations experienced <b>by</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> Icelanders with the ostentatious displays of their Danish colonial overloads; he also portrays individuals afflicted by psychosis, alcohol use disorders and medically unexplained physical symptoms, and delineates the path towards a ‘celebrity’ suicide. The novel warns against self-deceptive vanity and community-endorsed illusions, and celebrates the persistent benefits of nurturing relationships, all within a lyric contemplation of individual adaptive resilience and quotidian domestic pleasure...|$|R
500|$|In April 1916, Mikl's {{regiment}} was {{deployed to}} South Tyrol {{to take part}} in the Austrian spring offensive, during which he was awarded the bronze Military Merit Medal on the ribbon of the Bravery Medal with War Decoration (...) , for leading a successful attack on an Italian position on Monte Cengio. At the end of June, his regiment was transported back to Galicia by rail to reinforce the Austro-Hungarian forces being <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> the Russian Brusilov Offensive. In July, Mikl's regiment was used as a [...] "fire brigade" [...] within the Army Group, and helped prevent the penetration of the Russian offensive through the Jablonika Pass. Their task completed, Mikl's regiment was promptly transferred back to fight the Italians on the Southern Front. Mikl's regiment arrived on the Isonzo Front on 20 August, and remained there until late autumn 1917, fighting in the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Battles of the Isonzo. During the Eighth Battle of the Isonzo on 10 October 1916, Mikl was wounded once again, and was hospitalised. When he recovered, he was assigned to the regimental replacement battalion until spring 1917. For three months during the summer of 1917, Mikl was employed as an instructor at the VII Corps Reserve Officer's School, preparing young officers for service at the front. In January 1917, he was awarded the silver Military Merit Medal on the ribbon of the Bravery Medal with War Decoration. In August 1917, Mikl was appointed to command a machine gun company, and served in the Battle of Caporetto and the subsequent advance to the Piave river. On 12 November 1917, Mikl's regiment was the first to establish a bridgehead over the Piave at Zenson di Piave, and he was instrumental in rallying the troops of his regiment when they came under heavy fire as they landed on the Italian side of river. For his leadership at this crucial stage of the river crossing, he was awarded a bar to his silver Military Merit Medal. On 15 May 1918, Mikl began a preparatory course for future attendance at the War College (...) in Vienna, and when the war ended he was posted to the 54th Rifle Division in Galicia.|$|E

The image of Travolta and Jackson's characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007, BBC News reported that [...] "London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by 'guerrilla artist' Banksy...

While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was coming up on the outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano.

60|$|Yet {{this little}} herb-like willow, {{one of the}} most northerly and hardy of European plants, is a true tree at heart none the less for all that. Soft and {{succulent}} as it looks in branch and leaf, you may yet count on it sometimes as many rings of annual growth as on a lordly Scotch fir-tree. But where? Why, underground. For see how cunning it is, this little stunted descendant of proud forest lords: <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>by</b> nature, it has learnt {{to make the best of}} its difficult and precarious position. It has a woody trunk at core, like all other trees; but this trunk never appears above the level of the soil: it creeps and roots underground in tortuous zigzags between the crags and boulders that lie strewn through its thin sheet of upland leaf-mould. By this simple plan the willow manages to get protection in winter, on the same principle as when we human gardeners lay down the stems of vines: only the willow remains laid down all the year and always. But in summer it sends up its short-lived herbaceous branches, covered with tiny green leaves, and ending at last in a single silky catkin. Yet between the great weeping willow and this last degraded mountain representative of the same primitive type, you can trace in Europe alone at least a dozen distinct intermediate forms, all well marked in their differences, and all progressively dwarfed by long stress of unfavourable conditions.|$|E

40|$|Use of the {{internet}} by patients has attracted widespread attention in the popular media. Using the image of <b>hard-pressed</b> doctors besieged <b>by</b> patients waving internet-printout, {{it is suggested that}} internet information changes the doctor-patient relationship. The purpose of this research is to examine the extent to which patients search for health information on {{the internet}}; how this affects the medical consultation; and how the selection of treatment and outcome is affected. Focusing on three medical conditions where extensive information is available on the internet - cancer, diabetes and depression - the research will gather data from patients and doctors in primary and secondary care. A questionnaire survey will be used to measure the extent to which patients use the internet for finding healthcare information. The effect of the information use on the doctor-patient relationship and patients' health will be examined through the audio-recording of consultations, diary-keeping and interviews. Additionally observation of patients' online searching behaviour will be used to understand how patients judge the quality of information. Online interviews and observation of discussions will be used to understand the nature and role of web-based disease related discussion communities. By providing detailed evidence about how patients use internet based health information the research will enable doctors and healthcare managers to (a) design services to respond to changing patient expectations and requirements, (b) develop systems to support patients in acquiring and evaluating health information, and (c) ensure the appropriate training of healthcare professionals. The research will be overseen by an advisory board comprising patient, professional and NHS representatives. The results of the research will be published through a range of popular and professional media to ensure that the results of the research inform policy and practice...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} summer of 1555, Sue was again threatening, and Motonari was <b>hard-pressed.</b> Harukata was <b>by</b> {{no means a}} poor fighter, and the danger of his {{retainers}} and allies deserting the Mōri led Motonari to adopt a bold and unorthodox scheme. His plan involved Miyajima, home to the Itsukushima Shrine and a place combatants had traditionally avoided on religious grounds. The suggestion to occupy this place, which was strategically located just off the Aki coast in the Inland Sea, actually came from Mōri's generals. Initially, Motonari refused the idea on tactical grounds. For Miyajima {{to be a viable}} base of operations, Sakurao Castle - the nearest fort on the mainland to Miyajima - would also have to be held. Should Sakurao fall, any army on Miyajima risked being isolated. Yet Mōri's own doubts led him to form a plan in which he would lure Sue into this exact trap. Naturally, such a tactic would require Sue to act accordingly, and for inducement, Motonari immediately gave orders that Miyajima was to be occupied, and a fort thrown up quite near the Itskushima shrine. In September, Sue fell into the trap. He landed with the bulk of his army on Miyajima and assaulted the (intentionally) thin defenses of Miyao Castle. When the island had been secured (including the capture of Sakurao), Sue threw up a few fortifications on To-no-oka (Pagoda Hill) and sat down to plot strategy. From his point of view, it should be noted, the capture of Miyajima was a strategic boon. From this secure springboard he could embark to almost any point along the Aki coast, as well as Bingo Province. Since the following autumn, Mōri had assumed a largely defensive posture, and Sue had some reason to feel comfortable in his new forward headquarters. Sue thus made his second great mistake - he became complacent.|$|R

The race marked {{the second time in}} under a month that American Pharoah, {{training}} with Baffert in California, had flown across the country, raising concerns that the extensive air travel was taking a toll on the horse. [...] The only previous Triple Crown winner to win the Travers was Whirlaway in 1941, and two others, Gallant Fox and Affirmed, had been defeated there, helping give the track its nickname [...] "Graveyard of Champions". Baffert had one Travers win (in 2001 with Point Given) in five previous attempts. With American Pharoah training well, he stated, [...] "I've been looking for an excuse not to come (to the Travers) and I can't find one." [...] "He was valiant in defeat." [...] —Bob Baffert American Pharoah faced a field of 10 horses, most of whom, including Keen Ice, he had previously defeated. [...] Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. [...] While the horse led for much of the race, he was <b>hard-pressed</b> throughout <b>by</b> Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario, altering the [...] "complexion" [...] of the race. The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he [...] "knew he was in trouble" [...] by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was coming up on the outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation.After the race, Espinoza said, [...] "He's OK ... Maybe it was just a little too much for him those three weeks, flying back and forth. He was running pretty comfortable there, but not like he used to." [...] Baffert was proud of the horse's fighting effort, stating [...] "It was just guts." [...] Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." [...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed ... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth ... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best ... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|R
