40|$|Extract] There is an over-increasing {{expectation}} for trainees {{and junior}} doctors to publish more. It {{is very important}} to deal with some questions before you think about how to write a paper. The questions which should come to your mind are what should you submit for publication, when should you submit and where? Satisfactory answers to these questions will save your time and will help you to write in a systematic way which will {{have a better chance of}} your article getting published in a <b>good</b> <b>reputed,</b> international indexed, peer reviewed journal. The first step in developing a manuscript is to focus on a subject or problem that might be of significant interest to colleagues in the field. Next, the writer must conduct a detailed survey of the relevant literature, the results of which will help him or her to decide whether to actually write about the topic. It is important that before planning to write a scientific paper certain questions regarding its worthiness, the format and target audience should be addressed. These issues are crucial and determine how well a paper is written which will eventually be acceptable for publication...|$|R

The turning point in his career was an engagement in Ireland in 1907. In twelve weeks' engagement with Woodbrook Bray C.C. he took over a hundred wickets and his possibilities as a bowler were realised by the Yorkshire authorities.|$|R

50|$|The {{perfection}} of spiritual strength consists in a man's daring to confess {{the faith of}} Christ {{in the presence of}} everyone. This is done without error or confusion. Spiritual strength drives out inordinate terror. This is the sacrament of Confirmation. One becomes a front line fighter for the faith of Christ. Warriors carry the insignia of their master. So it is with the confirmed: they carry the sign of Christ. The signing takes place with a mixture of oil and balm which is called chrism, and not without reason. This designated the power of the Holy Spirit. They are called anointed (Psalm 44,8; Luke 4,18). They are called Christians Acts 9,26). This is because they are warriors under Christ. The balm gives a pleasing fragrance, which indicates one of <b>good</b> public <b>repute.</b> These are called forth from the recesses of the Church to the field of battle. This sacrament is conferred only by bishops. These are enrolled in the spiritual military forces. Manliness is derived from Christ.|$|R

5000|$|The New Christian {{presence}} in Uruguay {{dates back to}} the 16th century, yet few documents relating to converso history during the Colonial period are extant. In 1726, the governor of Montevideo called upon the first settlers to be [...] "persons of worth, of <b>good</b> habits, <b>repute</b> and family, so that they be not inferior nor of Moorish or Jewish race." [...] The first record of open Jewish settlement is in the 1770s. With the end of the Inquisition in 1813, the political and social system of Uruguay evolved to a greater level of openness and tolerance. This openness provided the basis for continued Jewish residence beginning in the 19th century. In 1929, the Ashkenazi Jewish community set up an educational network. Jewish schools have been functioning {{in various parts of the}} country since the 1920s. In the 1930s, there were significant Fascist and liberal anti-immigration elements that opposed all foreign immigration, weighing heavily on Jewish immigration. Jews were singled out and many people opposed Jewish inclusion in Uruguayan society.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of 1756, as will well appear farther on, it became {{manifest}} to the Saxon Court and to all the world that somebody had been playing traitor in the Dresden Archives. Somebody, especially in the Foreign Department; copying furtively, and imparting to Prussia, Despatches of the most secret, thrice-secret and thrice-dangerous nature, which lie reposited there! Who can have done it? Guesses, researcher, were many: at length suspicion fell on one Menzel, a KANZELLIST (Government Clerk), of <b>good</b> social <b>repute,</b> and superior official ability; who is not himself in the Foreign Department at all; but whose way of living, or the like sign, had perhaps seemed questionable. In 1757, Menzel, and the Saxon Court and its businesses, were all at Warsaw; Menzel dreaming of no disturbance, but prosecuting his affairs as formerly,--when, one day, September 24th (the slot-hounds, long scenting and tracking, being now at the mark), Menzel and an Associate of his were suddenly arrested. Confronted with their crimes, with the proofs in readiness; and next day,--made a clear Confession, finding the matter desperate otherwise, Copy of which, in Notarial form, exact and indisputable, the reader shall now see. As this story, of Friedrich and the Saxon Archives, was very famous in the world, and mythic circumstances are prevalent, let us glance into it with our own eyes, since there is opportunity in brief compass.|$|R

50|$|After Arminius' death, the Romans {{left the}} Cherusci {{more or less}} to their own devices. In the year 47 the Cherusci asked Rome to send Italicus, the nephew of Arminius, to become king, as civil war had {{destroyed}} their nobility. He was initially well liked, but since {{he was raised in}} Rome as a Roman citizen he soon fell out of favor. Tacitus writes of the Cherusci of his time (about 100 AD):Dwelling {{on one side of the}} Chauci and Chatti, the Cherusci long cherished, unassailed, an excessive and enervating love of peace. This was more pleasant than safe, for to be peaceful is self-deception among lawless and powerful neighbours. Where the strong hand decides, moderation and justice are terms applied only to the more powerful; and so the Cherusci, ever <b>reputed</b> <b>good</b> and just, are now called cowards and fools, while in the case of the victorious Chatti success has been identified with prudence. The downfall of the Cherusci brought with it also that of the Fosi, a neighbouring tribe, which shared equally in their disasters, though they had been inferior to them in prosperous days.|$|R
5000|$|Since at MMC, workers {{apparently}} do {{not receive}} promotions but instead must every few years apply for new jobs internally, gameplay proceeds very cyclically.

Their character's performance in their previous position (poor, <b>good,</b> average), their <b>repute</b> in individual departments, and the status of the global business cycle (the economy is a state of expansion, recession, or even depression) determines this list, down which the player can (if they are incompetent or even unlucky) fall precipitously, or get stuck in low or mid-level jobs.

60|$|The {{house of}} Heine Brothers, in Munich, was of <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> {{at the time}} of which I am about to tell,--a time not long ago; and is so still, I trust. It was of <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> in its own way, seeing that no man doubted the word or {{solvency}} of Heine Brothers; but they did not possess, as bankers, what would in England be considered a large or profitable business. The operations of English bankers are bewildering in their magnitude. Legions of clerks are employed. The senior book-keepers, though only salaried servants, are themselves great men; while the real partners are inscrutable, mysterious, opulent beyond measure, and altogether unknown to their customers. Take any firm at random,--Brown, Jones, and Cox, let us say,--the probability is that Jones has been dead these fifty years, that Brown is a Cabinet Minister, and that Cox is master of a pack of hounds in Leicestershire. But it was by no means so with the house of Heine Brothers, of Munich. There they were, the two elderly men, daily to be seen at their dingy office in the Schrannen Platz; and if any business was to be transacted requiring the interchange of more than a word or two, it was the younger brother with whom the customer was, as a matter of course, brought into contact. There were three clerks in the establishment; an old man, namely, who sat with the elder brother and had no personal dealings with the public; a young Englishman, of whom we shall anon hear more; and a boy who ran messages, put the wood on to the stoves, and swept out the bank. Truly he house of Heine Brothers was of no great importance; but nevertheless it was of <b>good</b> <b>repute.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Of late {{years the}} name of Walt Whitman {{has been a good}} deal bandied about in books and magazines. It has become {{familiar}} both in <b>good</b> and ill <b>repute.</b> His works have been largely bespattered with praise by his admirers, and cruelly mauled and mangled by irreverent enemies. Now, whether his poetry is good or bad as poetry, is a matter that may admit of a difference of opinion without alienating those who differ. We could not keep the peace with a man who should put forward claims to taste and yet depreciate the choruses in [...] "Samson Agonistes"; but, I think, we may shake hands with one who sees no more in Walt Whitman's volume, from a literary point of view, than a farrago of incompetent essays in a wrong direction. That may not be at all our own opinion. We may think that, when a work contains many unforgettable phrases, it cannot be altogether devoid of literary merit. We may even see passages of a high poetry here and there among its eccentric contents. But when all is said, Walt Whitman is neither a Milton nor a Shakespeare; to appreciate his works is not a condition necessary to salvation; and I would not disinherit a son upon the question, nor even think much the worse of a critic, for I should always have an idea what he meant.|$|R
6000|$|From Rome Mr. Greg and a {{companion}} went to Naples, and from Naples {{they made their}} way to Sicily. I have said that Mr. Greg had not Byron's historic sense; still this was the Byronic era, and no one felt its influence more fervently. From youth {{to the end of his}} life, through <b>good</b> and evil <b>repute,</b> Mr. Greg maintained Byron's supremacy among poets of the modern time. It was no wonder, then, that he should write home to his friends,--'I am tired of civilised Europe, and I want to see a wild country if I can.' Accordingly at Naples he made up his mind to undertake what would be a very adventurous tour even in our day, travelling through Greece and Asia Minor to Constantinople, and thence northwards through Hungary to Vienna. This wild and hazardous part of his tour gave him a refreshment and pleasure that he had not found in Swiss landscapes or Italian cities, and he enjoyed the excitement of the 'wild countries' as thoroughly as he had expected. On his return to England he published anonymously an account of what he had seen in Greece and Turkey, in a volume which, if occasionally florid and imaginative, is still a lively and copious piece of description. It is even now worth turning to for a picture of the ruin and distraction of Greece after the final expulsion of the Turk.[5] ...|$|R
40|$|Globalization, either {{directly}} or indirectly (e. g. through structural adjustment reforms), has called for profound changes in the previously existing institutional order. Some changes adversely impacted the production and market environment of many coffee producers in developing countries resulting in more risky and less remunerative coffee transactions. This paper focuses on customization of a tropical commodity, fair-trade coffee, as an approach to mitigating the effects of worsened market conditions for small-scale coffee producers in less developed countries. fair-trade labeling is viewed as a form of “de-commodification” of coffee through product differentiation on ethical grounds. This is significant not only as a solution to the market failure caused by pervasive information asymmetries along the supply chain, but also as a means of revitalizing the agricultural-commodity-based trade of less developed countries (LDCs) that has been languishing under globalization. More specifically, fair-trade {{is an example of how}} the same strategy adopted by developed countries’ producers/ processors (i. e. the sequence product differentiation - institutional certification - advertisement) can be used by LDC producers to increase the reputation content of their outputs by transforming them from mere commodities into “decommodified” (i. e. customized and more <b>reputed)</b> <b>goods.</b> The resulting segmentation of the world coffee market makes possible to meet the demand by consumers with preference for this “(ethically) customized” coffee and to transfer a share of the accruing economic rents backward to the Fair-trade coffee producers in LDCs. It should however be stressed that this outcome cannot be taken for granted since investments are needed to promote the required institutional innovations. In Italy FTC is a niche market with very few private brands selling this product. However, an increase of FTC market share could be a big commercial opportunity for farmers in LDCs and other economic agents involved along the international coffee chain. Hence, this research explores consumers’ knowledge of labels promoting quality products, consumption coffee habits, brand loyalty, willingness to pay and market segmentation according to the heterogeneity of preferences for coffee products. The latter was assessed developing a D-efficient design where stimuli refinement was tested during two focus groups. fair-trade coffee, product decommodification, choice experiments, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
