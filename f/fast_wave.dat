The {{nonlinear}} excitation of <b>fast</b> magnetosonic <b>waves</b> by phase mixing Alfvén {{waves in}} a cold plasma with a smooth inhomogeneity of density across a uniform magnetic field is considered. If initially <b>fast</b> <b>waves</b> are absent from the system, then nonlinearity leads to their excitation by transver-sal gradients in the Alfvén wave. The efficiency of the nonlinear Alfvén–fast magnetosonic wave coupling is strongly increased by the inhomogeneity of the medium.

The effect is similar to Alfvèn wave phase mixing in a static, inhomogeneous medium and leads {{to the production of}} steep transversal gradients in the plasma parameters, which increases dissipation. Transversal gradients in the total pressure, produced by phase mixing, lead to the secular generation of obliquely propagating <b>fast</b> magnetosonic <b>waves,</b> at double the frequency and the wavenumber of the source Alfvén waves. The efficiency of the generation is defined by the Alfvén wave amplitude and the transversal spatial scale of the flow inhomogeneity.
