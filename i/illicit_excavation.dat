5000|$|Whether {{on public}} or private land, each Party agrees to {{establish}} a certain code of conduct of archaeological work and preservation methods.Article 3, paragraph i states that each Party needs to implement a controlled procedure of archaeological activities preventing “any <b>illicit</b> <b>excavation</b> or removal of elements of the archaeological heritage” and assuring that archaeological resource management is applied in a scientific way. That principle includes that every investigation shall be as minimal as possible in its impact and uncovered findings are proper conserved during or after excavation.Excavations must be {{under the control of}} qualified, specially authorised persons (see Art. 3, para ii).In addition, [...] "the use of metal detectors and any other detection equipment must be subject to specific prior authorization" [...] (see Art. 3, para ii). Otherwise the arbitrary use of such equipment leads to destruction of context by digging up anything that the machine registers without knowing what it actually is.|$|E

40|$|Looting {{refers to}} the act of digging up {{artifacts}} without the recording of the excavation, context or other activities related to archaeological excavation, either the purpose of collecting or sale (Hart and Chilton 2015, 319). An <b>illicit</b> <b>excavation</b> {{refers to the}} undocumented, illicitly obtained artifacts that are excavated {{from the ground and}} sold for profit (Proulx 2013, 111). This activity is a widespread action that affects all the countries in the world, in one way or another. Looting is the third largest illegal market after drugs and weapons (Szopa 2004, 56); it funds armed conflicts, denies human rights to culture, history and identity and depletes an irreplaceable resource. In this thesis I aim to show the current situation of protecting of the archaeological heritage from looting in Romania, the current state of looting activities and what are the actions undertaken by the heritage experts and institutions in order to fulfill that purpose. Furthermore, I aim to study {{the extent to which the}} activities of metal detecting are hindering the protection of archaeological sites and if those activities are illegal in terms of national or international legislation framework...|$|E

40|$|The Dead Sea Scrolls—in {{the popular}} imagination, the very name conjures up scandal, intrigue and mystery. Tales of <b>illicit</b> <b>excavations,</b> clandestine purchases, and midnight trips to Beirut, {{all with the}} sound of gunfire {{crackling}} in the background, abound in the lore of the Scrolls and the scholars associated with them. While visions of Roland de Vaux as a French Indiana Jones may be the product of an overheated imagination, the actual story of the discovery of the Scrolls is nevertheless an exciting one in the annals of archaeology. To say that the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has revolutionized the study of the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism is to repeat what has become a well-worn cliché. But clichés, though trite, are often true, and, in fact, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has revolutionized the study of the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism...|$|R

H: 0. 53 mDescription: The site is located {{on the south side of}} the valley between the modern villages of Gökçeler and Yeşilköy, in rugged terrain where two additional settlements were discovered (C 032, C 033) within 3 km of each other. The settlement overlooks the Koca Dere, a seasonal torrent bed that carries runoff from the ridge to the southeast. The large Roman aqueduct that runs from the far side of this ridge to Aphrodisias passes close by, although none of these settlement sites appears to have been inhabited during the second century and later when the aqueduct was in use. ** The settlement occupies a level hilltop of approximately 85 m by 45 m, and contains two large buildings each with multiple rooms. The walls of the buildings are constructed of unmortared schist likely quarried from outcroppings nearby. At least nine rooms survive in the larger building, with an average room size of 5. 0 m by 7. 0 m. The second building consists of at least six rooms of comparable size, and the topography of the site suggests this was the full extent of these buildings. The walls are preserved to a maximum height of 0. 50 m and are approximately 0. 70 m thick. No other structures are identifiable, and there has been extensive illegal excavation across the site. ** There is evidence for at least two olive oil presses at the site. Two schist counterweight blocks survive in the larger building. There is also a schist socket block just west of the smaller building. Next to it is a press bed, which is the only block at the site carved out of marble. ** The datable pottery from this site is limited to the Hellenistic and Early Imperial periods. The cookware is of special interest. It consists largely of earlier LCW and includes an unusually broad selection of storage vessel and bowl rims, some of which are unknown from contexts at the city or elsewhere in the region. The general indication from the ceramics is that the site was largely or entirely abandoned by the Early Imperial period. It is possible, however, that after being inhabited year-round in the Hellenistic period, it was used only during production season in later periods. Finds: Iron slag. Pottery suggests that the site was occupied primarily in the Hellenistic to Early Imperial periods. ** Systematic pottery collection conducted 18 June 200...|$|E

50|$|Jabal al-'Awd {{had been}} known since the 19th century for its Qatabānian rock inscription. In the 1970s a French epigraphist, Christian Robin, copied {{a few of the}} inscriptions. In the winter of 1996 the {{attention}} of archaeologists was finally alerted to the importance of the site thanks to <b>illicit</b> <b>excavations</b> there which had unearthed amazing bronzes, in both South Arabian and Mediterranean styles. In 1998 the German Archaeological Institute requested permission from the Yemeni Archaeology Authority to start official excavations of the site, primarily to establish where exactly the illicitly excavated objects were found, and also to investigate further any evidence of cultural relations between Yemen and especially the Mediterranean in early Himyaritic times. The German Archaeological Institute subsequently sent six field campaigns to the mountain, though their work was interrupted in 2003 for three years due to tribal unrest. The German archaeologists found that the previous illicit finds had been unearthed from a huge building complex, apparently a large residence with a courtyard, and further digging produced many more important finds, including statues, items of furniture and vessels.|$|R

40|$|An archaeological {{survey of}} the plain of Tehran was begun in August 2003, marking the {{initiation}} of {{the second phase of}} collaborative research between Durham University, the University of Bradford, the University of Leicester, the University of Tehran and the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organisation (ICHTO). The survey was launched with three main aims. Firstly, to pilot the collection of data regarding the frequency, distribution, density and condition of sites from the terminal Palaeolithic c. 8000 B. C., through the Late Chalcolithic c. 3000 B. C. to the present. Secondly, to provide a basis from which to select prehistoric sites for detailed survey and test excavation in order to enhance the absolute chronology of the Tehran plain. Finally, to begin to assess the archaeological landscape background to these changes in the light of geomorphological analysis. In the summer of 2004, we continued this work during a second season and recorded a total of 123 archaeological sites, including 14 previously unkown Chalcolithic sites. One of the larger Chalcolithic sites to be identified in our first season, Tepe Pardis, was also excavated in 2004 in order to enhance the absolute chronology for the plain, and has generated dates of c. 5300 B. C. for the Late Neolithic/Transitional Chalcolithic interface (Fig. 1).

The extant walls are buried under as much as 2. 0 m of loose stone, brick, and rubble, perhaps from the collapsed vault or semidome of the building. Along the apse, the inner face of the wall is visible to a height 1. 1 m above the present ground surface, as is a single bench synthronon (H: 0. 30 m), both exposed by <b>illicit</b> <b>excavations.</b> Numerous fragments of roof tiles and marble paving stones are {{mixed in with the}} debris. The side walls are built of unmortared schist with some brick inclusions. The rubble masonry of the apse and synthronon (W: 0. 70 m), however, is heavily mortared, and the joints between the stones are scored (Fig. 21). The full 0. 8 m thickness of the side walls can be measured only at {{what appears to be the}} dividing wall between the nave and the narthex; the maximum preserved height is 0. 8 m, and the wall is exposed for 1. 1 m. Robber's pits along the north wall have exposed some other construction details, including the inner wall of the apse and the foundations of the synthronon. From the southeast end of the apse, the outer wall runs to the southeast at a right angle to the apse wall for at least 1. 4 m, probably connecting the naos to a side chamber. A platform about 8 m wide extends the length of the southern (downhill) side of the chapel and perhaps indicates the presence of an ancillary structure there. ** Fragments of the church's marble decoration that have survived in the area include a doorjamb found in front of an abandoned house not far from the church in 2005 but not seen again in subsequent visits. Nearby was a fragment of a marble screen panel showing the lower arm of a lobed cross together with an unidentified motif, perhaps a stylized cypress tree (A 071) (H: 0. 47 m; W: 0. 30 m; D: 0. 08 m). Both the doorjamb and the screen panel could be from this church. The decoration of the jamb block is typically Middle Byzantine; one side is profiled, and the front is carved with interlocked chains of guilloches and lozenges. This design is comparable to the decoration of architectural features that were part of the renovation of the Cathedral in Aphrodisias, dated to the tenth century...|$|R
