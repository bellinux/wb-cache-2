40|$|We have {{previously}} found a temperature-dependent upflow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region following a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). In this paper, we reanalyzed the observations along with previous {{work on this}} event, and provided boundary conditions for modeling. We found that <b>the</b> intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region dramatically drops within 30 minutes from the flare onset, and <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region reaches <b>the</b> equilibrium stage after ∼ 1 hour later. The temperature-dependent upflows were observed during the equilibrium stage by EIS. The cross sectional area of <b>the</b> fluxtube <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region {{does not appear to}} expand significantly. From the observational constraints, we reconstructed the temperature-dependent upflow by using a new method which considers the mass and momentum conservation law, and demonstrated the height variation of plasma conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region.

40|$|Dynamic {{lighting}} systems are introduced in urban outdoor environments {{with the objective}} to reduce energy use. Effects on pedestrians are not fully known. Previous studies have mainly used observer assessment (Viliunas et al., 2014), and focused on perceived personal safety (Haans & de Kort, 2012) or acceptance (Boomsma & Steg, 2013). In this study, performance (walking speed and reading) was assessed in a full-scale laboratory arranged as an outdoor environment with a 19 m pathway and a luminaire (LED). A movement detector was placed 10 m before the luminaire. Participants (N = 61) walked the pathway at slower speed if <b>the</b> lighting was <b>dimed,</b> although light levels increased to 100 % when they passed the sensor, than if the light level was held constant at 100 % (F(4, 212) = 6. 67, p< 0. 001, ω 2 = 0. 01). Consistently, the visibility was rated lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimed</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constant condition (F(4, 240) = 2. 53, p< 0. 05, ω 2 = 0. 01).

40|$|To make {{a smooth}} {{touchdown}} when landing, an insect {{must be able}} to reliably control its approach speed as well as its body and leg position – behaviors that are thought to be regulated primarily by visual information. Bumblebees forage and land under a broad range of light intensities and while their behavior during the final moments of landing has been described in detail in bright light, little is known about how this is affected by decreasing light intensity. Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimmest</b> light. We suggest that <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> landing behavior that occurred in dim light might represent adaptations that allow the bees to perform smooth landings across the broad range of light intensities at which they are active...|$|R
