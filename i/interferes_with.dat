5|$|Lead {{can cause}} severe {{damage to the}} brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier. It degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons, reduces their numbers, <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> neurotransmission routes, and decreases neuronal growth.|$|E
5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E

5|$|Tungsten is {{the only}} metal from the third {{transition}} series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea.

5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> the hatchlings' {{ability to}} navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, {{perhaps because they}} block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation. Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> sex.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E

The value of L-S index between 0.8 and 1.2 indicates that these ions may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> natural film formations (Rabbani et al. 2008). In the study area, chloride and sulfate interfere in 62.3 % {{of the samples}}, do not <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> natural film formation in 15.58 % of the samples and may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> natural film formation in 22 % of the samples (Table  4; Fig.  11).|$|R
5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is {{because they believe that}} taking life <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E

Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E

40|$|The place {{conditioning}} paradigm {{has been}} used to assess the antinausea potential of drugs in non-emetic animal species. The present experiments were designed to determine the potential of A 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate both conditioned and unconditioned sickness in rats (Rattus norvegiens). The results in the present study suggest that when the place aversion is strong (Experiment 1), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the establishment; however when the aversion is weak (Experiments 2 and 3), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the expression. Also, when administered during acquisition of a strong amphetamine-induced place preference, THC also seems to <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the establishment of the preference.

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters.
