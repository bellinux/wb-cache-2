500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of the diary's {{passages}} are unflinching in {{exposing the}} behavior at the imperial court, particularly that of drunken courtiers who seduced the ladies-in-waiting. As Keene describes it, {{the court was}} a place where the courtiers were [...] "drunken men who make obscene jokes and paw at women". Murasaki complained about drunk courtiers and princes who behaved badly, such as the incident when at a banquet court poet Fujiwara no Kintō joined a group of women asking whether Murasaki was present– alluding to the character in The Tale of Genji. Murasaki retorted that none of the novel's characters lived at this tawdry and unpleasant court, so unlike the court in her novel. She left the banquet when [...] "Counsellor Takai... started pulling at Lady Hyōbu's robes and singing dreadful songs, but His Excellency said nothing. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bound to be a terribly drunken affair this evening, so... Lady Saishō and I decided to retire." ...|$|E

60|$|It was Mary! She had returned. The thongs {{no longer}} hurt me. The pangs of hunger and thirst disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been {{loneliness}} from which I suffered most.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did--for {{a minute}} or two," [...] Frank confessed with an embarrassed smile. [...] "Then, of course, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible." ...|$|E
60|$|As my machine sank {{among them}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fight or die, with good chances of dying in any event, and so I struck {{the ground with}} drawn long-sword ready to defend myself as I could.|$|E
60|$|With the {{approach}} of night <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to make arrangements for the girl's comfort. With {{the aid of a}} couple of upright poles I stretched a grey blanket across the raft so as to make a complete partition.|$|E
6000|$|I journey home: {{the pattern}} grows [...] Of moonshades on the way: [...] "Soon the first quarter, I suppose," [...] Sky-glancing {{travellers}} say; <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it,</b> for those, [...] Has been a common day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} nothing to do but to {{investigate}} this as far as we can. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would cut you to have everybody in the school know of your sleep-walking habit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{see that}} I {{can do nothing}} by {{ordinary}} methods. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is useless to make a public outcry. There is only my own conviction that Margaret came to a violent end, and I cannot expect anyone to pay heed to that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment, sir," [...] I said, as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a pink bald head, {{and not a}} red face, {{which was}} {{fronting}} me. [...] "I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman. What has he done?" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{photograph}} was certainly very off-colored. An unkind critic might easily have misinterpreted <b>that</b> dim surface. <b>It</b> was a dull gray landscape, and as I gradually deciphered {{the details of}} <b>it</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly like an immense cataract seen in the distance, with a sloping, tree-clad plain in the foreground.|$|R
40|$|When {{asked to}} choose one article from my tenure as editor, {{it seemed as though}} it would be a fairly easy task. The more I thought about it, however, the more <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be an almost {{impossible}} task. Due to a limit on length, the selection was very difficult to make. One semi-nal article too long to reprint immediately came to mind...|$|R
60|$|So great was my fear as to {{what the}} future might have in store for us that I had failed to hear the hum of voices, until my {{attention}} was thus attracted, and then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> yet quite early in the evening, instead of well toward morning, as I had supposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally not, monsieur," [...] I cried, {{somewhat}} heated by {{this seemingly}} studied ignoring of important facts, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Monsieur de Castelroux's mission to arrest {{and not to}} judge me. Monsieur de Castelroux was an officer, not a Tribunal, and to have denied this or that to him {{would have been so}} much waste of breath." ...|$|E
60|$|I was come by {{then to the}} Garonne. I drew rein {{beside the}} swiftly flowing stream, winding itself like a flood of {{glittering}} silver between the black shadows of its banks. A little while I sat there listening, and surveying the stately, turreted chateau that loomed, a grey, noble pile, beyond the water. I speculated what demesne this might be, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably Lavedan.|$|E
60|$|My Riz Diane duly arrived, but was served, I noticed, by a {{different}} waiter. It looked very tempting, and it was indeed a dish of which I was particularly fond, but <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been specially ordered by Louis, and with a sigh I pushed it on one side. I finished my luncheon with rolls and butter, and took care to procure my coffee before Louis returned.|$|R
5000|$|Sapna, once again, did a {{commercial}} for PETA in January 2013. With the slogan [...] "Ink not Mink - Be comfortable in your own skin and let animals keep theirs", she shot this advertisement in the nude. She said in a statement, [...] "I take a very strong stance on leather. After I educated myself and saw a few films on the cruelty {{and what happens to}} animals, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> just wasn't worth it." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{moved to}} a smaller team, Jean Delatour, but the mistreatment continued. In 2001 at Four Days of Dunkirk, he later told Bicycling, [...] "several guys tried to ride me into the ditch [...] [...] [...] it got dangerous, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn't worth continuing". He ended his {{professional}} road racing career. In her book about the Armstrong doping scandal, Cycle of Lies, Juliet Macur wrote that Bassons' mistreatment {{was a sign of}} the power Armstrong had over international cycling at the time.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{more than}} {{possible}} we might never {{come out from}} beneath these timbers alive because of having been killed by our own friends. The triumph which had been mine was sadly marred by the timorousness which came over me, as I understood that death might be nearer at hand than {{when we were in}} old Mary's cabin, with Abel Hunt roaming around the village in search of us.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat up in}} bed, heavy, unrefreshed, {{and with}} a {{splitting}} headache. The clock on the mantelpiece was striking three o'clock; from below I could hear the clatter of vehicles in the courtyard, and the distant roar of traffic from the streets beyond. Slowly <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon; the events of the night before re-formed themselves in my mind. I rang the bell for the valet and sprang out of bed.|$|E
60|$|General Ward {{had issued}} orders that the lads be {{committed}} to the earth with all the ceremony of a military funeral, and we Minute Boys {{who were able to}} march, acted as guard of honor. It was all very imposing; {{but at the same time}} solemn, and my heart grew chill with fear as to the future, when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more than probable others of our company would give up their lives before we had won out in this fight against the king.|$|E
5000|$|In Starbucks The Way I See It No 233 {{she said}} [...] "I {{used to think}} that going to the jungle made my life an adventure. However, after years of unusual work in exotic places, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not how far off I go, or how deep into the forest I walk that gives my life meaning. I see that living life fully is what makes life - anyone’s life, no matter where they do or do not go - an adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not at all. <b>I</b> merely <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was possible, {{from your}} story, for Monsieur Lawrence {{to go to}} the poison cupboard. The {{possibility}} had to be confirmed, or eliminated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} I've {{captured}} the creature, I don't {{know what to}} do with her," [...] went on Mister Woodchuck; [...] "although I believe, of course, she should be punished in some way, and made to feel as unhappy as her people have made us feel. Yet <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a dreadful thing to hurt any living creature, and as far as I'm concerned I'm quite willing to forgive her." [...] With these words he wiped his face with a red silk handkerchief, as if really distressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "John Carter, John Carter," [...] she sobbed, {{with her}} dear head upon my shoulder; [...] "even now I can scarce believe the witness {{of my own}} eyes. When the girl, Thuvia, {{told me that you}} had {{returned}} to Barsoom, I listened, but I could not understand, for it seemed that such happiness would be impossible for one who had suffered so in silent loneliness for all these long years. At last, when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> truth, and then came to know the awful place in which I was held prisoner, I learned to doubt that even you could reach me here.|$|E
60|$|I am free {{to confess}} {{that when he}} thus left me at liberty there was but one thought in my mind, and that to seek my own safety in flight, {{regardless}} of my comrades, or of the old negro whose life might be in danger if I thus deserted him. I was cowardly enough for an instant to think only of myself, to look forward only {{to the possibility of}} saving my own skin; but, fortunately, even before I could have turned to flee like a poltroon, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty as a lad of Virginia, even though I had seemingly thrown aside the name of Minute Boy, to remain with my comrades whom I had thus counselled into peril.|$|E
60|$|It is hard luck on a {{young fellow}} to have {{expensive}} tastes, great expectations, aristocratic connections, but no actual money in his pocket, and no profession by which he may earn any. The fact was that my father, a good, sanguine, easy-going man, had such confidence in the wealth and benevolence of his bachelor elder brother, Lord Southerton, that he {{took it for granted}} that I, his only son, would never be called upon to earn a living for myself. He imagined that if there were not a vacancy for me on the great Southerton Estates, at least there would be found some post in that diplomatic service which still remains the special preserve of our privileged classes. He died too early to realize how false his calculations had been. Neither my uncle nor the State took the slightest notice of me, or showed any interest in my career. An occasional brace of pheasants, or basket of hares, was all that ever reached me to remind me that I was heir to Otwell House and one of the richest estates in the country. In the meantime, I found myself a bachelor and man about town, living in a suite of apartments in Grosvenor Mansions, with no occupation save that of pigeon-shooting and polo-playing at Hurlingham. Month by month <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more and more difficult to get the brokers to renew my bills, or to cash any further post-obits upon an unentailed property. Ruin lay right across my path, and every day I saw it clearer, nearer, and more absolutely unavoidable.|$|E
60|$|Yes, man is strangely and wonderfully made. Now that I coolly {{consider}} the matter, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{essentially the same}} spirit with which I enjoyed beating up Tom Spink, that I {{have in the past}} enjoyed contests of the mind in which I have out-epigrammed clever opponents. In the one case, one proves himself top-dog of the mind; in the other, top-dog of the muscle. Whistler and Wilde were just as much intellectual bullies as I was a physical bully yesterday morning when I punched Tom Spink into lying down and staying down.|$|R
40|$|As I {{consider}} {{what it is}} I most want to say in this brief essay, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is almost February and, essay marking aside, the winter term of teaching {{has come to an}} end. Already, after only four months in Tokyo, it is with some difficulty that I recall the first impressions of a stranger in a strange land; but the sense of achievement when I negotiated my way in, through and out of Shibuya station on my own is still palpable (and faintly ridiculous – I am after all a fully grown adult) ...|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Bright" [...] by guitarist Peter White (Good Day, 2009) was {{dedicated}} {{according to a}} note in the album sleeve [...] "to the memory of Wayman Tisdale, whose spirit never failed to brighten our lives." [...] White said: “The guy was always so happy, so positive, always had a smile, always made you feel great. Even before his death, I’d always called this song ‘Bright,’ because it sounded uplifting and happy and funny. Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be the perfect}} song to dedicate to Wayman, because that was the way he came across to the world.” ...|$|R
