5|$|<b>Democracy,</b> or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of <b>democracy</b> is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a <b>democracy</b> is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a <b>democracy</b> may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Democracy</b> storyline is {{generally}} regarded as having concluded with the Referendum story, {{which was published in}} 1991. However, although the main <b>Democracy</b> campaign had indeed ended, repercussions continued in the strip for years afterwards. This took three forms.|$|E
5000|$|Kant's Democratic Peace Theory {{has since}} been revised by Neoliberals like Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye. These theorists have seen that <b>democracies</b> do in fact fight wars. However, <b>democracies</b> do not fight wars with other <b>democracies</b> because of {{capitalist}} ties. <b>Democracies</b> are economically dependent and therefore {{are more likely to}} resolve issues diplomatically. Furthermore, citizens in <b>democracies</b> are less likely to think of citizens in other <b>democracies</b> as enemies because of shared morals. [...] Kant's original ideas have influenced liberalist scholars and have had a large impact on liberal thought.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Recent {{scholarship}} {{finds that}} new <b>democracies</b> {{are more likely}} than estab-lished <b>democracies</b> to make binding commitments to international human rights institu-tions. Are new <b>democracies</b> also better at following through on these commitments? Stated differently, does their greater willingness to join international institutions reflect a genuine commitment to human rights reform or is it just “cheap talk? ” We analyze this question using a new data set of more than 1, 000 leading European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) cases. Since new <b>democracies</b> face judgments that are more difficult to implement than established <b>democracies,</b> we employ a genetic matching algorithm to balance the data set. After controlling for bureaucratic and judi-cial capacity, we find that new <b>democracies</b> do implement similar ECtHR judgments ini-tially more quickly than established <b>democracies,</b> but this effect reverses the longer a judgment remains pending. Although new <b>democracies</b> have incentives to implement judgments quickly, they sometimes lack checks and balances that help ensure imple-mentation should an executive resist. A growing literature asserts that new <b>democracies</b> {{are more likely than}} stable democ...|$|R

40|$|Political {{parties have}} {{a central role}} to play in {{democratic}} consolidation, yet we know comparatively little about how effectively they represent social cleavages in newly emerging <b>democracies.</b> Using the Lipset–Rokkan framework, this article examines the role of parties in articulating social cleavages in 14 established and 6 emerging <b>democracies</b> using the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems datasets. The results show that the social cleavages in the emerging <b>democracies</b> {{are similar to those of}} the established <b>democracies,</b> with religion and class predominating.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} systematic performance {{differences between}} {{younger and older}} democracies: younger <b>democracies</b> are more corrupt; exhibit less rule of law, lower levels of bureaucratic quality, and lower secondary school enrollments; and spend more on public investment and government workers. Only one theory explains the effects of democratic age on {{the wide range of}} policy outcomes examined here-the inability of political competitors in younger <b>democracies</b> to make credible promises to citizens. This explanation, first advanced in Keefer and Vlaicu (2004), offers a concrete interpretation of what political institutionalization might mean, and why it is that young <b>democracies</b> frequently fail to become older and well-performing <b>democracies.</b> A variety of tests support this explanation against alternatives. The effect of democratic age remains large even after controlling for the possibilities that voters are less well-informed in young <b>democracies,</b> that young <b>democracies</b> have systematically different political and electoral institutions, or that young <b>democracies</b> exhibit more polarized societies.

40|$|<b>Democracies</b> {{differ from}} autocracies in that <b>democracies</b> produce stable, not high or low, growth in {{national}} income. We analyze the likely risk/return preferences of voters, and hypothesize {{that the underlying}} causal mechanism generating democratic stability is that <b>democracies</b> more accurately reflect the risk aversion of ordinary citizens. We test our hypothesis in several ways. First, we reexamine three studies of comparative economic voting and find that voters penalize incumbents when economic volatility increases. Second, we use extreme bounds regression analyses to show that <b>democracies,</b> compared to autocracies, are characterized by less volatility in economic growth rates. Third, we find that democratic stability {{does not appear to}} arise because <b>democracies</b> ameliorate the effects of social cleavages, another mechanism that might explain democratic stability. When growth and volatility are jointly examined, <b>democracies</b> reveal highly favorable economic results...|$|R

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of antiquity, monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was {{in the hands of}} a number of people, that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the archaic period (c. 750–500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek poleis, and also in Rome (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility (aristocracy), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations (tyranny, 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy (oligarchy) or assemblies of free male citizens (<b>democracy)</b> emerged in Classical Greece (mainly after 500 BCE). Athenian <b>democracy</b> (6th century–322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; classical Sparta (c. 550–371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy (dual kingship), aristocracy (Gerousia) and <b>democracy</b> (Apella); the Roman Republic (c. 509–27 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, <b>democracy</b> and especially aristocracy.|$|E

40|$|Summary {{of a paper}} {{delivered}} by Roland Rich on the relevance of democratic peace theory to East Asia. Democratic peace theory holds that while liberal <b>democracies</b> may {{go to war with}} non-liberal states, they remain at peace with each other, in other words <b>democracies</b> do not fight each other. While the theory may hold some truth for consolidated <b>democracies,</b> this paper draws attention to the argument by Mansfield and Snyder that transitional <b>democracies</b> tend to be more war-prone in their international relations...|$|R
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{support the}} democratic peace on probabilistic grounds: since many wars have been fought since <b>democracies</b> first arose, {{we might expect}} a proportionate number of wars to have occurred between <b>democracies,</b> if <b>democracies</b> fought each other as freely as other pairs of states; but proponents of democratic peace theory claim that the number is much less than might be expected. However, opponents of the theory argue this is mistaken and claim there are numerous examples of wars between <b>democracies.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{clash of}} civilizations’ of Samuel Huntington and ‘the end of history’ of Francis Fukuyama are two grand {{theories}} {{that have been}} widely accepted as the most dominant narratives in post- Cold War international relations. Unfortunately, there have been litt le theoretical developments in today’s world {{to predict the future}} of international conﬂ ict. The theory assumed that the future international conﬂ ict will not occur between <b>democracies</b> and non-democracies as Democratic Peace Theory proposed, but between established <b>democracies</b> and emerging <b>democracies.</b> The established <b>democracies</b> reluctant to share their power with the emerging <b>democracies</b> on how to manage global order. This reluctancy will lead to political frictions and conﬂ icts among them. In spite of its theoretical breakthrough, this theory suﬀ ers of logical inconsistency since it does not distinguish between emerging <b>democracies</b> and emerging powers. Instead of conﬂ ict among <b>democracies,</b> this article argues that international conﬂ icts in the 21 st century will be dominated by asimetrical conﬂ ict between nation-states and radical movements, conﬂ icts due to information openess, and conﬂ ict over natural resources...|$|R
