40|$|Purpose Service {{ecosystems}} are gaining credence among management scholars. However, {{there is still}} little agreement about the distinguishing attributes of service ecosystems in {{both the public and}} the private sectors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to focus on the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> system, suggesting a “recipe” for the implementation of a sustainable and innovative <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methodology was used. First, a critical literature review was conducted to lay the conceptual foundations of this study. Then a theory about the institutional, organizational and managerial requisites for the implementation of a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem was developed. Findings The <b>health</b> <b>care</b> sector is appropriate for the core tenets of the service ecosystem perspective. Tailored interventions aimed at improving the functioning of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem should be implemented at the micro, meso, macro and mega levels. Patient empowerment, patient-centered care and integrated care are the fundamental ingredients of the recipe for effective <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystems. Practical implications The ecosystem approach provides health policy makers with interesting insights to help shape the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> system of the future. The paper also contributes to the innovation of managerial practices emphasizing the role of patient involvement in the design and delivery of <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Originality/value This is one of the first attempts to systematize scientific knowledge about service ecosystems in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> sector. An agenda for further research is suggested, in order to further advance the establishment of an effective and innovative <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem...|$|R

5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> is {{always at the}} {{forefront}} of professional, political, concern stakeholders, and managerial attention. However, the key dimensions contributing to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> quality not been fully understood. Many studies have been conducted to measure <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> quality, but most of them in developed countries, especially in Europe and the USA; the results may not be applied to the Malaysian context due to difference in culture, environment, and facilities accessibility. Although, the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> quality research in developing countries is growing nonetheless, the study is not widespread in Malaysia. Only few empirical studies on healthcare service quality from Malaysia can be identified published in journals and the findings are inconsistent. Thus, to fill this knowledge gap, this study developed a service quality model for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> by framing the association of service quality antecedents, perceived service quality, patient satisfaction, and behavioral compliance. To validate the research model and test the proposed research hypotheses, the study used a quantitative approach as a research paradigm, cross-sectional design as a survey method, combination of cluster and convenience sampling as a sampling technique and partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as a data analysis technique. The findings of the study show that <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> quality is a context-specific and multi-dimensional constructs. Given the high power achieved from the analysis, this thesis has significant theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, the study extends service quality research by reconstructing the model as a reflective, multi-dimensional constructs and evaluating the impacts of antecedent constructs on perceived service quality, patient satisfaction and behavioral compliance in the context of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> in Malaysia. Methodologically, the study validates that PLS-SEM is suitable to estimate the parameters of a multi-dimensional constructs. Practically, the study provides hospital management with a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> quality model for conducting integrated analysis and design of service delivery systems. Overall, the study makes a significant contribution to healthcare organizations, better health outcomes for patients and better quality of life for the communit...|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} was opened in 1933 by the U.S. {{government as a}} United States Marine Hospital Service hospital. Replacing a facility in Port Townsend, it opened with 312 beds in 1933. The hospital originally served veterans, merchant seamen, the US Coast Guard, the US Lighthouse Service, and poor and indigent people defined as “federal compensation cases”. In 1951, it was re-designated as a US Public Health Service facility along with all other Marine hospitals. In 1953, a three-story annex was constructed on {{the east end of}} the building to serve outpatient clinics. Two stair towers were added to the south face in 1975. The building continued to grow in 1980 as a laboratory and primary care addition were built. The federal government ceased operation of the facility and other similar hospitals in 1981. Control was shifted to Seattle, and the city chartered the Pacific Hospital Preservation and Development Authority(PHPDA). The PHPDA owns the property and uses long-term tenants with leases. Lease revenues are advance the PHPDA’s mission of providing <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> to low-income uninsured and under-insured persons in King County.
