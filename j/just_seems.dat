5|$|It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like a feel-good record {{but when}} you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally {{the luck of the}} draw whether that person is into us or not. It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> wildly unfair, I think.|$|E
25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had not {{wanted to do a}} sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day by a team of lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to have come out of nowhere.|$|E

500|$|The {{radio tower}} scene {{initially}} called for Electro {{to climb to}} {{the very top of}} the structure, a concept the crew found [...] "clunky" [...] throughout the storyboarding and directing process. Victor Cook, a producer and developer for The Spectacular Spider-Man, observed [...] "He's gonna climb the whole tower? It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> kind of weird." [...] Before release, the scene was altered to have Electro gradually propel himself up the tower with several electrical blasts.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} are mixed. Andy Patrizio from IGN.com wrote that [...] "The Robbery" [...] was the best episode of the first season of Seinfeld, saying that it showed [...] "the {{dynamics}} that would come to define the show." [...] However, Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "It lacks the great banter and play that marks the best episodes, but it doesn't come across as a total dud. It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> a bit uninspired in the greater scheme of things." ...|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry {{speculated that}} after several episodes of a [...] "semi-normal" [...] Michael, the writers [...] "were aching {{to bring back}} cringe worthy Michael." [...] She criticized the decision, calling his {{behavior}} [...] "borderline ridiculous (and not in a good way). It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> implausible that someone could be so very clueless that they would act like that in public." [...] Skerry however did find high points, such as the opening sequence and any scene with Dwight and Angela. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A".|$|E

[...] Town Supervisor John W. Burke at the time noted the board's recognition that [...] "in view of the fuel shortage, construction of gas turbines <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> {{out of step with the}} direction being taken by the average consumer, who lowers his thermostat and wears a sweater in his home to reduce the amount of fuel burning." ...|$|E
500|$|Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "The Red Headed Stranger {{is simple}} and bare. Following {{the story of a}} preacher man that kills his {{cheating}} wife and her lover, ol' Willie spins the tale with a laid back nonchalance that <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to ooze out of him, his aching chords and somber melodies encapsulating the futility and pain of his character's situation [...] The Red Headed Stranger is timeless. Willie Nelson's captivating story telling, and the minimalist majesty of his music fills a well worn grove in the hearts of those that enjoy the folk roots of the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, {{reporter}} for the New York Chronicle. Law believed so much in Conran's movie that {{he became one of}} the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember [...] "any other name coming up. It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board." [...] Paltrow said in an interview, [...] "I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie." ...|$|E

500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented on}} the episode in a {{negative}} way, writing that it was [...] "a harsh and cynical move , though I could forgive the decision if it produced a more satisfying episode. Perhaps the writers made this one super-sincere to counteract the inherent cynicism behind its origins, but the show <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> sappy and lame." [...] Winnipeg Free Press columnist Randall King wrote in his review of the eleventh season of The Simpsons that there is [...] "something undeniably funny about having Maude Flanders die by a barrage of T-shirts fired by air cannons at a speedway. But the episode Alone Again Natura-Diddily was proof that the dependably brilliant series could – and did – go seriously wrong when it turned 11. Killing off Maude was a sin [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The debate's {{focus on}} the public {{perception}} of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger Glenn Reynolds stated that [...] "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market." [...] Lawrence Lessig criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that [...] "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research." [...] Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.|$|E
500|$|Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout said, [...] "the way {{in which}} [...] {{continually}} addresses Britney Spears <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> the least bit odd", but commented on how pleasant the song is. A review by Idolator noticed [...] "Britney" [...] has [...] "a melody that dares to be clear and pretty in ways emo bands [...] don’t usually dare," [...] and commented how the song's [...] "strongly sung" [...] lyrics are [...] "sweet [...] not cynical at all." [...] The Denver Post reported that after the song's release, Spears' mother Lynne thanked Norman for writing the song, [...] "because {{it was all she}} wanted to say to her daughter." [...] On the week of September 19, 2008, [...] "Britney" [...] peaked at number twenty-eight on Billboard Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E

5000|$|The fossil marine worm species Websteroprion armstrongi {{is named}} for Armstrong; the {{researchers}} who named it — both heavy-metal fans — stated that [...] "Alex Webster <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like the perfect fit for a giant worm with saw-like jaws".|$|R
5000|$|Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool proclaimed D.P. 7 [...] "a {{wonderful}} comic book, everything <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to gel together perfectly on that series, and on Quasar {{that followed}} it, and I was hooked. Paul had a classically clean style." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a more mixed review. He wrote: [...] "Like most guest star-ridden episodes, this one gets a bit gimmicky {{to fit in}} all the cameos." [...] He found the self-referential ending [...] "fails to become clever and instead <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> silly." [...] However, he wrote that the episode [...] "includes a few goods bits, {{especially}} the phone call in which Homer convinces Lenny {{to go to the}} game." [...] Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News wrote that the episode is [...] "so jam-packed with guest celebrity voices that they ran out of room for a plot. Or humor." [...] Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com gave a negative review as well, and wrote that the episode is [...] "lost amid a flurry of celebrity walk-ons and lazy jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|That same day, Bloomsbury {{cancelled}} all Asda's {{orders of}} Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills {{from the company}} totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth Harry Potter book. [...] "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, [...] "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody." [...] The dispute had been [...] "going on a while – going on for weeks actually." [...] Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them") and that, as one company spokesman claimed, [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying {{everything they can to}} stop kids getting hold of Harry Potter at a price they can afford." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{assumptions}} {{underlying the}} nativist view {{have also been}} criticised in Jeffrey Elman's Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development, which defends the connectionist approach that Pinker attacked. In his 1996 book Impossible Minds, the machine intelligence researcher Igor Aleksander calls The Language Instinct excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, [...] "a cultural repository of language <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic state machine to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|In one of {{his suicide}} notes, he wrote: [...] "Things <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to go too wrong too many times". His ashes were brought back to England by satirist Willie Rushton, and were buried in St. Dunstan's Church in Cranford, west London.|$|R
5000|$|The episode's end tag (during {{the closing}} credits) {{featured}} a rap collaboration between Troy, Abed and Professor June Bauer (Betty White) set to Toto's [...] "Africa". According to Harmon, [...] "it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> appropriate {{because of her}} being an anthropology professor." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ashley Dominique of Geeked Out Nation {{gave the}} episode a B- rating. [...] "Centered around a {{situation}} {{that should have been}} filled with tension, everyone in [...] "Man Of Fire" [...] sic <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going through the motions." ...|$|R
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Ricky Gervais {{acknowledged}} {{that there were}} feelings of hesitation from certain viewers. The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics {{with some of them}} comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling which was also based on a British version. The New York Daily News called it [...] "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," [...] and USA Today called it a [...] "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original." [...] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating, [...] "(Steve Carell) <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to be trying too hard ... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. But right now he's a pale imitation." [...] Tom Shales of the Washington Post said it was [...] "not the mishmash that [...] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out." ...|$|E
3000|$|It didn’t feel {{directed}} enough … I {{was kind}} of like why are we doing this, it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like a random fun activity… I mean it’s fun but there’s not point to it {{in the grand scheme of}} things. (Student 6) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|A {{replica of}} the restaurant's {{interior}} was used for a scene in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. Bill Contos said of the replica, [...] "It was either that or ship the McCormick mansion to the West Coast, and this <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> easier." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{piece is}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{assumed to be}} based on the Mozart composition [...] "Rondo alla Turca". In 2003, during an interview, Dave Brubeck commented that [...] "I should've just called it 'Blue Rondo', because the title <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to confuse people." ...|$|R
