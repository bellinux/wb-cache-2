40|$|What is the {{diameter}} of the World Wide Web? The answer is not 7, 927 miles, even though the Web truly is World Wide. According to Albert-László Barabási, Reka Albert and Hawoong Jeong of Notre Dame University, the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Web</b> is 19. The diameter in question is not a geometric distance; the concept comes from the branch of mathematics called graph theory. On the Web, you get from place to place by clicking on hypertext links, and so it makes sense to define distance by counting your steps through such links. The question is: If you select two Web pages at random, how many links will separate them, on average? Among the 800 million pages on the Web, there’s room to wande...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in a CFD {{analysis}} of filter media flow is to create a computational domain geometry which imitates the simulated media as closely as is practical. The media in the present study combined a relatively flat web of nanofibers with a cellulosic fiber support media. A CFD grid suited to calculating the flow patterns through the cellulosic media structure would be far too coarse to simulate flow around the nanofiber web elements. This scale difference forces some assumption about the interaction between the media layers. Our models are limited to two dimensions, representing cross-sections cut through the media. Our initial studies modeled the nanofiber web alone, {{on the assumption that the}} flow around the nanofibers is not greatly influenced by the presence of the downstream cellulosic fibers. Our image-analysis technique samples the distribution of fiber diameters by scribing parallel lines across the image. The <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> element at each line/fiber crossing is tabulated. An estimate is made of the maximum width on the image for which the web element cross-section can be considered circular. We make the assumption that the relatively flat web elements linking round sections have oval cross-sections, all of the same thickness. We found that the distribution of web element widths is "doubly-truncated log-normal", meaning that both lower and upper limits to the widths exist. This geometry was used with a CFD code to calculate particle capture, and compared to results of tests on the actual medi...|$|E

50|$|Nephila produce large {{asymmetric}} orb webs {{up to one}} and a half {{meters in}} <b>diameter.</b> <b>The</b> hub <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> is not positioned centrally but rather in the upper section, this means that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sticky capture stands are found in <b>the</b> lower section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>web.</b> Nephila remain in their webs permanently and therefore have a higher predation risk. There is a barrier web structure on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>web</b> to mitigate this risk.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>web</b> graph is a {{real-world}} self-organizing network whose vertices correspond to web pages, and whose edges correspond to links between pages. Many stochastic models for <b>the</b> <b>web</b> graph have been recently proposed, with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> reproducing {{one or more}} of its observed properties and parameters. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most intensely studied parameters for <b>the</b> <b>web</b> graph are <b>the</b> degree distribution and diameter. A recent stochastic model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> graph is <b>the</b> protean graph Pn(d, η). In this model, vertices are renewed over time, and older vertices are more likely to receive edges than younger ones. While previous work on the model focussed on the power law degree distribution of protean graphs, in this note we study its diameter. Since the protean graphs may be disconnected, we focus on <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant component. Our main result is that <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant component <b>of</b> Pn(d, η) is equal to Θ(log n), which supports experimental data observed in <b>the</b> actual <b>web</b> graph...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{terminal}} <b>web</b> is a filamentous structure {{found at}} <b>the</b> apical surface <b>of</b> epithelial cells that possess microvilli. It is composed primarily of actin filaments stabilized by spectrin, which also anchors <b>the</b> terminal <b>web</b> to <b>the</b> apical cell membrane. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> myosin II and tropomyosin {{helps to explain}} <b>the</b> contractile ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terminal <b>web.</b> When contracted, <b>the</b> terminal <b>web</b> causes a decrease in <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell, causing the microvilli, which are anchored into <b>the</b> terminal <b>web</b> through their stiff actin fibers, to spread apart.
