Proceedings of the Internationa 1 Conference for Agricultural Machinery & Process Engineering October 19 - 22. 1993. Seoul. KoreaA study of heat transfer and water vapour transport {{in a large}} industrial apple coolstore was undertaken. A set of measurements was made including product cooling rates in both pre-cooling units and the bulk-storage area, evaporator and fan performance, floor and building shell temperatures, door opening frequency and air temperature, relative humidity (RH) and velocity variation with both position and time. Measurements within pallet pre-coolers showed large variations in product cooling rate, between apple cartons but this could not be attributed to any positional factor studied. The spread of data was probably due to widely differing airflows through and around each apple carton. A staggered pallet pre-cooler configuration had a 30 % faster cooling rate on average than an in-line pallet arrangement. Measurements of cooling rates within single cartons showed large variation of cooling rate with position within a carton, probably resulting from non-uniform airflow within the carton. Existing heat conduction-based models were unable to predict the level of variability of cooling rate within cartons. A multi-zoned conduction and convection model was developed which predicts apple temperature and weight loss, air temperature, enthalpy and humidity, and packaging temperature with position within the carton. Testing of the model against measured data showed good fit for air and apple temperatures, but insufficient data were available for comprehensive testing of the humidity and weight loss sub-models. Difficulties in developing methodology to accurately define the patterns of airflow within cartons were not adequately overcome, so measurements to determine airflow patterns would be required before predictions could be made for alternative packaging systems. Within the coolstore measured there was significant positional variation in air temperature and humidity associated with local heat sources (such as pre-coolers, doors, uninsulated floor, and warm fruit batches), {{and the degree of}} air circulation as quantified by local air velocities. In addition, temperature and humidity showed a diurnal fluctuation associated with the operation of the coolstore. These results suggested the need for a multi-zone dynamic model to enable predictions of both the time and the positional variation to be made. Such a model was developed which included component models for zone air, external surfaces, floors, heat generators, inert materials such as internal structural components, evaporators, fans, doors and product. Novel features of the model compared to existing models are that it estimates airflow between zones using fixed user defined pathways, rather than complex hydrodynamic models; it considers water vapour transport in detail as well as heat transfer; condensation on surfaces and water absorption by packaging are modelled; and the product sub-model both allows movement of product batches during the simulation and accounts for differences in cooling rate within a batch. Single-zone, 5 -zone, 8 -zone and 34 -zone versions of the model were tested. The 1 -zone model predicted mean thermal conditions for the coolstore adequately. The 5 -zone model which differentiated the pre-coolers and the bulk-storage area predicted measured data well for the pre-coolers, but more time-variability was predicted for the bulk-storage area than occurred in the measured data. Separate <b>door</b> <b>zones</b> and vertical subdivision of the bulk-storage area were allowed in the 8 -zone model. The pre-cooler prediction was largely unchanged and predicted vertical temperature differences were consistent with measured data, but the predicted mean temperature in the bulk-storage area was offset from the measurements. Little accuracy improvement was achieved by further subdivision (up to 34 zones), probably because of imprecision in defining and predicting interzone airflow rates. Irrespective of the number of zones, adequate air humidity predictions could only be achieved when water absorption by packaging was modelled as well as product weight loss, door infiltration and deposition of moisture on evaporators. For the industrial coolstore studied use of 5 or 8 air zones appeared to be the best trade off between accuracy and complexity. The model allows study of the effect of design and operational features on coolstore air temperature, humidity, product temperature and weight loss with better accuracy than previous models...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} energy saving impact {{replacing}} vestibules with air curtain doors (single doors fitted with air curtain units) has on energy usage of commercial buildings. Laboratory experiments {{were used to}} investigate the infiltration characteristics of air curtains in a small size chamber and to validate numerical simulation methods. Experimental flow and pressure as well as particle image velocimetry data confirmed that air curtains can significantly reduce air infiltration {{when compared to the}} single and vestibule doors. In addition, the results indicated that the CFD modeling methods used are valid in capturing the characteristics of the airflow at the door with air curtains. CFD simulations were conducted for a full scale door with consideration for the door operation cycle and the existence of people in the doorway. The results of the simulations were used to conduct energy simulations for two reference building models. The end use site-energy performances of the whole buildings with air curtain, vestibule and single doors are compared using two infiltration calculation methods. The energy simulations conducted show that, on a national average level, air curtain doors save energy (in comparison to code requirements). Finally, considering the space saving benefit of air curtains and their lower initial costs, air curtains are concluded to be a valid and energy saving alternative to vestibule <b>doors</b> in climate <b>zones</b> 3 to 8 and a valuable energy saving addition in climate zones 1 & 2...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{aircraft}} loadmaster career field was not formally {{established by the}} US Air Force until 1953, duties eventually assumed by loadmasters began early in World War II when laundry personnel assigned to Air Corps quartermaster units began flying on troop carrier transports in the Australia and New Guinea, later in the China-Burma-India area of operations, to eject cargo bundles they have previously prepared for airdrop from the <b>doors</b> over drop <b>zones.</b> By 1944 the IX Troop Carrier Command in Europe included personnel designated as [...] "dropmasters" [...] in its troop carrier squadrons.

40|$|The 9 th Circuit {{decided to}} {{overturn}} a local California county zoning ordinance that was infringing upon a citizen’s Second Amendment {{right to own}} and operate a gun store. The ordinance stated that any store that sold firearms or operated as a firing range needed to be 500 {{feet away from the}} front door of the shop to the front <b>door</b> of school <b>zones,</b> government buildings, residential areas, and other stores that sell firearms. The owners of Valley Guns 2 ̆ 6 Ammo found a place located in Alameda County, just outside the radius and began working on acquiring the property and renovating it into their gun store and firing range. During this time period, the county came by and informed the owners that they could not operate their gun store at the building because their store would be located inside the disqualifying radius. The building that was to be used had only one door, and the owners had measured the distance from the front door to the nearest disqualifying property’s front door at 532 feet away. The court declined to address the factual issue of the county improperly measuring the distance, and instead determined the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance that regulates the Second Amendment. The owners of the store appealed the zoning violation, claiming that they were outside the radius as described by the statute. The county measured from the exterior wall of the store to the nearest “residential property line rather from door to door,” putting the property 54 feet too close to the closest disqualifying property marker. Once the case reached the 9 th Circuit, the court overturned the lower court’s decision, holding that the ordinance as read and interpreted by the lower court was a violation of the storeowner’s Second Amendment rights. The court recognized the importance of protecting one’s fundamental rights from an overbearing government ordinance. This ruling gained a great deal of criticism from the public and the fellow judges, especially in the dissent which claimed that this was not a Second Amendment claim, but merely a zoning issue made to look like a Second Amendment claim...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of mobility, {{conflicts}} and local opposition may be generated not only by hard implementation of big transport infrastructures, but also by soft measures of traffic regulation. An example is represented by 20 mph Zones, which aim to enhance the intrinsic multifunctionality of urban streets: they try to limit the entity and the speed of car flows in residential areas through redesigning road spaces, so to improve in the meantime the liveableness and the environmental and aesthetic quality of these areas. The speed limitation of 20 mph can however determine protests and disputes by local residents and workers, as it disadvantages private motorized mobility, which represents – at least in most current Italian cities – the main form of mobility. The paper analyzes this kind of conflicts, through the case study of the Mirafiori Nord 20 mph Zone in Turin, which is recognized as a best practice in the Italian context. The analysis of this case, {{as well as the}} investigation of the main European and American guidelines on traffic calming techniques and plans, shows that a few critical issues turn out to be crucial in order to prevent and manage these conflicts. First of all, a prompt, well-timed communication plan is essential in order to inform residents and users of the area about the potential costs and benefits of traffic calming measures: even before implementation works begin, people has to know that lower accessibility levels by car will be compensated by an improvement of streets liveableness and environmental quality. From this perspective, residents should be involved in designing the new green and street equipments that may be placed, thanks to the redistribution of significant portions of road space to slow mobility components. Participation of school children is quite recommended, for example in the ideation of vertical signs for the access <b>doors</b> of the <b>zone,</b> in experiencing new pedestrian or cycling home-school journeys, and so on. Parking restrictions are often firmly unaccepted by residents, and should carefully assessed before being proposed. Regular reporting of monitored outcomes of the implemented traffic calming measures (mainly in terms of reduction of maximum speed, of dead or injured persons in road accidents, of pollution and noise local levels etc.) must allow keeping residents conscious of the actual benefits they can enjoy. Last, the implementation of 20 mph Zones must be framed in a more general strategy for urban mobility: push measures (just such as 20 mph Zones) for limiting accessibility levels to private traffic flows have to be counterbalanced by pull measures aimed at potentiating public transport, in order to better balance the modal split; otherwise, congestion on the primary road network could spread consistent traffic flows also inside residential areas, invalidating main benefits of traffic calming measures...|$|R

50|$|Behavioral studies {{prepared}} for the Federal Highway Administration {{and the city of}} San Francisco have shown that streets with shared lane arrows increase separation between motor vehicles and cyclists, encourage cyclists to ride outside of the <b>door</b> <b>zone,</b> and may reduce wrong way cycling and sidewalk cycling, which are associated with increased crash risk.|$|E
50|$|Dooring is {{a traffic}} {{collision}} {{in which a}} cyclist is struck by a car door. The width of the <b>door</b> <b>zone</b> in which this can happen varies, depending upon the model of car one is passing. The zone can be almost zero for a vehicle with gull-wing doors or much larger for a truck.|$|E
50|$|Being doored (colliding {{with the}} door of a car {{unexpectedly}} opened) is a prominent hazard. Many Class II/Class III bike lanes run in the <b>door</b> <b>zone.</b> While the law requires caution in opening car doors into traffic lanes, dooring remains common, and doored cyclists face injury and sometimes death. Cyclists must exercise caution, riding a door's length away from parked cars whenever practicable.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to find statistics on the incidence of <b>door</b> <b>zone</b> fatalities, serious injuries, and collisions as the type of accident is often not recorded consistently from city to city. However, an analysis of Chicago bike crashes found that there were 344 reported dooring crashes reported in 2011, for a rate of 0.94 doorings per day. Doorings made up 19.7% of all reported bike crashes. The number of additional doorings that occurred without being reported is unknown.|$|E
50|$|In early 2017 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (UK) {{endorsed}} the Dutch Reach as the recommended road safety practice to avoid dooring collisions.In May 2017 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' (USA) introduced the Dutch Reach far hand method into its 2017 Revised Driver's Manual, Chapter 4, Rules of the Road, as best practice for safe exiting of vehicles.

5000|$|Relative {{to other}} {{collisions}} such as getting rear ended, getting doored is less risky: [...] "80.04% of those cyclists who were doored were injured, while 94.40% {{of those in}} non-dooring crashes were injured." [...] Also, {{it should be noted}} that getting doored itself usually is not fatal; rather, most serious door-zone-related injuries are sustained by getting hit by a motor vehicle while swerving to avoid the door. Thus, most deaths and serious injuries occur in the travel lane and not in the <b>door</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Filtering forward, in stopped or {{extremely}} slow traffic, requires {{very slow}} speed and awareness {{that in a}} <b>door</b> <b>zone,</b> vehicle doors may unexpectedly open. Also, unexpected vehicle movements such as lane changes may occur with little warning. Buses and tractor-trailers require extreme care, as the cyclist may be nearly invisible to the drivers who may not expect someone to be filtering forward. To avoid a hook collision with a turning vehicle at an intersection after filtering forward to the intersection, cyclists are taught to either take a position {{directly in front of}} the stopped lead vehicle, or stay behind the lead vehicle. Cyclists should not stop directly at the passenger side of the lead vehicle, that being a blind spot.|$|E
5000|$|In {{comparison}} to Europe, Canadian cities {{are not as}} bike friendly. Canadian cars are larger with more blind spots, cities have higher speed limits, highways often travel {{in or near the}} core of the city and there is more on-street parking which can present more <b>door</b> <b>zone</b> hazards for cyclists. Consequently, some inexperienced cyclist will use a [...] "pedestrian" [...] style of riding where no cycling facilities exist in order to feel safer cycling in the city such as by riding on the sidewalk, rather than on the roadway. Although pedestrian cycling is technically illegal - as bicycles are deemed to be vehicles under the laws of all provinces - it is a common method in small town and suburban Canada (where pedestrians on sidewalks are often rare). Canadian cycling advocates typically favour cycling facilities like bike paths and bike lanes that provide a buffer between motor vehicles and cyclists. Protected bike lanes or cycle tracks have been adopted in strategic corridors in Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Ottawa with plans to add protected bike lanes in Victoria, Winnipeg and other cities across the country wanting to improve rates of active transportation.|$|E
5000|$|According to VicRoads hazards {{that cause}} cycling {{fatalities}} and injuries include [...] "side impact at intersections", [...] "manoeuvring", [...] "lane change" [...] {{as well as}} collisions between car doors and cyclists in the <b>door</b> <b>zone,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "car dooring" [...] in Australia. In Victoria it is illegal to [...] "cause a hazard to any person or vehicle by opening a door of a vehicle, leaving a door of a vehicle open, or getting off, or out of, a vehicle" [...] and it is also illegal to flee the scene of such an accident. While there were 1112 collisions caused by opening doors in the Australian state of Victoria between 2000 and 2010, the first fatality occurred in March 2010, when a car door opening casused university student James Cross to be propelled under the wheels of a passing truck. Eight percent of serious injuries to cyclists between 2006 and 2010 were cause by car doorings. In July 2012 Victoria increased the on-the-spot penalty for car dooring from $141 to $352, also increasing the maximum court imposed penalty from $432 to $1408. In March 2015 stickers were placed in taxis in the state, advising passengers to look for bicycles before leaving the vehicle; at the time 13% of car dooring incidents in the state involved taxis.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the serious}} societal, environmental, economic, and public health {{problems}} associated with motorized transportation, there is increased interest in encouraging non-motorized modes of travel. The current study contributes toward this objective in two ways. First, it evaluates the operational impacts of bicycling adjacent to on-street parking. Second, it identifies the importance of attributes influencing bicyclists ’ route choice preferences. The importance of evaluating both operations and individual preferences {{at the same time}} is the interrelationship between the two; poorly designed roadways may encourage cyclists to leave designated bicycle routes. Operationally, this study examines field data that was collected in Austin, Houston, and San Antonio and resulted in over 6, 400 observations of motorists and/or cyclists adjacent to on-street parking. From the data, multivariate regression models were developed to predict the motorist’s and cyclist’s position on the roadway and the probability of motor vehicle encroachment. The models indicate that on-street parking has a significant impact on motorist and cyclist position; a bike lane combined with a buffer space {{is the only way to}} completely remove cyclists from the <b>door</b> <b>zone,</b> and operationally, a bicycle lane is more effectiv...|$|E
40|$|Accurately {{generating}} {{an alarm}} for a moving door is {{a precondition for}} tracking, recognizing and segmenting objects or people entering or exiting the door. The challenge of generating an alarm when a door event occurs is difficult when dealing with complex doors, moving cameras, objects moving or an obscured entrance of the door, together {{with the presence of}} varying illumination conditions such as a door-way light being switched on. In this paper, we propose an effective method of tracking the door motion using edge-map information contained within a localised region {{at the top of the}} door. The region is located where the top edge of the door displaces every time the door is opened or closed. The proposed algorithm uses the edge-map information to detect the moving corner in the small windowed area with the help of a Harris corner detector. The moving corner detected in the selected region gives an exact coordinate of the door corner in motion, thus helping in generating an alarm to signify that the door is being opened or closed. Additionally, due to the prior selection of the small region, the proposed method nullifies the adverse effects mentioned above and helps prevent different objects that move in front of the door affecting its efficient tracking. The proposed overall method also generates an alarm to signify whether the door was displaced to provide entry or exit. To do this, an active contour orientation is computed to estimate the direction of motion of objects in the door area when an event occurs. This information is used to distinguish between objects and entities entering or exiting the door. A Hough transform is applied on a specific region in the frame to detect a line, which is used to perform error correction to the selected windows. The detected line coordinates are used to nullify the effects of a moving camera platform, thus improving the robustness of the results. The developed algorithm has been tested on all the <b>Door</b> <b>Zone</b> video sequences contained with the United Kingdom Home Office i-LIDs dataset, with promising results...|$|E
