The <b>insolated</b> leaves located in {{the lower part of the}} crown showed maximum photosynthesis at the time of the greatest incident irradiation of the leaf.

40|$|This study {{documents}} the temperature variance change {{in two different}} versions of a coupled ocean– atmosphere general circulation model forced with estimates of future increases of greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol concentrations. The variance changes are examined using an ensemble of 8 transient integrations for the older model version and 10 transient integrations for the newer one. Monthly and annual data are used to compute the mean and variance changes. Emphasis is placed upon computing and analyzing the variance changes for {{the middle of the}} twenty-first century and compared with those found in a control integration. The large-scale variance of lower-tropospheric temperature (including surface air temperature) generally decreases in high latitudes particularly during fall due to a delayed onset of sea ice as the climate warms. Sea ice acts to <b>insolate</b> the atmosphere from the much larger heat capacity of the ocean. Therefore, the near-surface temperature variance tends to be larger over the sea ice–covered regions, than the nearby ice-free regions. The near-surface temperature variance also decreases during the winter and spring due to a general reduction in the extent of sea ice during winter and spring. Changes in storminess were also examined and were found to have relatively little effect upon the reduction of temperature variance. Generally small changes of surface air temperature variance occurred in low and midlatitudes over both land and oceanic areas year-round. An exception to this was a general reduction of variance in the equatorial Pacific Ocean for the newer model. Small increases in the surface air temperature variance occur in mid- to high latitudes during the summer months, suggesting the possibility of more frequent and longer-lasting heat waves in response to increasing GHGs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Shadows {{caused by}} clouds, trees, {{buildings}} and other structures cause the photovoltaic power installation to produce less energy. When installing a PV-generator these shadows {{should be taken}} into account when calculating the power output of this installation. Specifically the power losses from the shadows caused by trees and buildings should be avoided and can be predicted by calculations. If these energy losses are too big it is recommended to remove the object causing the shadow or to reposition the PV-installation. In this thesis, the effect of shadows caused by buildings is examined more in detail because these shadows are very predictable and more easily simulated than shadows caused by trees or moving clouds. The goal is to achieve some values for the power and energy losses. For these simulations the same setup is always used so that the differences are more clear when different inputs for irradiance values are used. As an input for the irradiance three different values have been used. As a first case a set value of 1000 W/m² has been chosen as the irradiance <b>insolating</b> the PV-installation. Because this value is constant the first simulations are more straightforward and don’t take the fewer irradiance in the morning and evening into account. Secondly, the measured irradiance from the TUT PV-plant have been used. This data has been recorded {{for a couple of years}} now. The shadow caused by the building is then implemented in the irradiance curve from the selected day. Since there is data available from a couple of years already, the shadow can be added to clear sky days as well to cloudy days. The use of a cloudy day is used as the third case. To see the influence of the shadow in a more practical way, the data from a whole month is used. Each day the building causes the shadow around noon when the losses are the highest. In this way the energy losses are more realistic than when only clear sky days are used to observe the losses...|$|R

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la 40 th Annual Conference of Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology, celebrada en Southampton (UK) del 26 al 30 {{de marzo de}} 2012. AISc (Llobera 2010) can {{be defined}} as an {{integrative}} perspective where capturing data, representing, analysing and modelling archaeological events is an interdisciplinary focus. Moreover, we consider AISc as a logical consequence of accumulative experiences process in computer application in archaeology during last twenty years towards a synergy between computational resources and varied and extensive archaeological issues (data capturing process, analysis, representation, etc). Independently on the scale we focus (“intra-site” or “landscape”), we see in AISc a new opportunity in key areas: (i) Congruence between empirical observation of spatial proprieties of artefacts and its possible ways of perception and recording. In this direction, archaeologists need a complement for understand the inherent complexity in archaeological records. For this, virtual reality and analytical visualization are the most powerful issues for solving problems in spatial contexts. At an intra-site level, the possibility of interacting and modelling structures (postholes, hearths, stone alignments), distributions of remains, stratigraphy into a digital environment, is an ideal situation for testing and manipulating different hypothesis without affecting the real archaeological object. From a landscape perspective, the obstacles on representing cognitive approaches and collective behaviours have been widely noted by scholars. (ii) Comprehension of archaeological problems like an extensive network of actions (natural and social) and material consequences located in determinate area, and not in terms of distribution of materials remains that are defined under certain nominal categories. In this sense, statistical analysis is the best option for understanding, in terms of heuristic point of view, the presence of any spatial (and temporal) structure. To this effect, for an adequate understanding, the significance of variation and change is more than the recognition of any <b>insolating</b> cluster into a vacuum space, which is related with the reductionist idea of analysing the space where concrete actions were performed. (iii) Uncertainty as an approach to deal with multidimensional and incomplete structure of archaeological spatial datasets. Fuzzy-logic has been used in certain domains of science as way to extract logic from non-structured data, but its application in archaeology has been recent. Considering the incomplete condition of archaeological record as a conjunction of natural and human actions, fuzzy-logic approaches have started to proliferate in spatial analysis. Modelling and representing vagueness has become a way to interpret the spatial distribution of phenomena that overcome distribution maps of items. Since some authors have enounced its potential, it seems a good moment for develop the potential of this proposal and test if it is able to provide an acceptable connection between archaeological theory and practice. To illustrate the capabilities of this new approach, we will present and discuss some experiences and their proficiency on managing spatial data. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Complexos de formação estelar são os principais blocos de formação das galáxias. O estudo da estrutura e do conteúdo estelar de aglomerados imersos nesses complexos permite conhecer melhor os processos de formação estelar na Galáxia, visto que a estrutura dos aglomerados estelares reflete a estrutura do gás denso onde eles se formaram. Neste trabalho estudamos a natureza de uma série aglomerados estelares imersos/ projetados no complexo de regiões HII e nuvens moleculares NGC 6357. A amostra {{consiste}} de 5 aglomerados imersos no complexo, 1 aglomerado de idade intermediária projetado no bordo de NGC 6357, além de 3 candidatos que necessitam de mais análises. Pismis 24 é o único aglomerado da amostra estudado previamente na literatura. Usamos fotometria nas bandas JHKs do VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea Survey) complementada com a do 2 MASS para estrelas saturadas. Utilizamos como ferramenta um algoritmo de descontaminação das estrelas de campo que revela a morfologia intrínseca do aglomerado. Os parâmetros fotométricos da amostra foram derivados a partir do diagrama cor magnitude (CMD), por meio do ajuste de isocronas de Padova de metalicidade solar, computada com os filtros J, H e Ks do VVV. Os parâmetros estruturais foram derivados por meio dos perfis de densidade radial (RDPs). Os perfis foram construídos com estrelas selecionadas após a aplicação filtro cor-magnitude (CM) sobre a fotometria observada, o qual isola estrelas com grande probabilidade de serem membros do aglomerado. A distância media dos aglomerados imersos no complexo nos permitiu estimar que NGC 6357 encontra-se a uma distancia de 1. 76 + 0. 1 kpc do Sol. Tal distância tem sido questão de debate na literatura. O aglomerado de idade intermediária descoberto possui 5 ± 2 Gyr. Dois objetos imersos parecem ser subestruturas do aglomerado massivo Pismis 24. Concluímos que NGC 6357 possui pelo menos dois eventos de formação estelar da ordem de 5 e 9 Myr. Esta diferença de idade pode ajudar a compreender a história de formação estelar do complexo assim como a cinemática do gás. Star forming complexes are {{the major}} building blocks of galaxies. The study of the structure and stellar content of embedded clusters in these complexes allows us {{to better understand the}} processes of star formation in the Galaxy, since the structure of the star clusters reflects the structure of the dense gas in which they were formed. In this work we study the nature of a series of star clusters embedded or projected towards the complex of HII regions and molecular clouds NGC 6357. The sample consists of five clusters embedded in the complex, one intermediate-age cluster projected in the outskirts of NGC 6357, and four candidates that need further analyses. Pismis 24 is the only cluster of the sample previously studied in the literature. We use the VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea Survey) photometry in the JHKs bands complemented with 2 MASS for the saturated stars. We use an algorithm as a tool for field star decontamination which reveals the intrinsic morphology of the cluster. The photometric parameters of the sample were derived from the colour diagram magnitude (CMD) by means of solar-metallicity Padova isochrones computed with the VVV J, H and Ks filters. Structural parameters were derived by means of radial distribution profiles (RDPs). RDPs were built with stars selected after applying the colour-magnitude (CM) filter to the observed photometry, which <b>insolates</b> the stars with a high probability of being cluster members. The mean distance of the embedded clusters in the complex allowed us to estimate that NGC 6357 is at a distance of 1. 76 + 0. 1 kpc from the Sun. This distance has been a matter of debate in the literature. The discovered intermediate-age cluster has an age 5 ± 2 Gyr. The two embedded objects seem be substructures of the massive cluster Pismis 24. We conclude that NGC 6357 has had at least two stellar generation events, range in the 5 to 9 Myr.

Approximately 32 million kg of atrazine are used each year for crop production in the United States. Recent reports have raised concern about continued use of atrazine and several other herbicides because of their negative impacts on aquatic life and potential endangerment of animal / human health and environment. Identification of novel fungal species capable of degrading these herbicides provides evidence for the vast diversity in microbial communities that still remains to be explored. Present paper discussed an attempt to biosorb atrazine on an <b>insolated</b> fungal strain and to study the effect of various parameters on biosorption of atrazine.

40|$|Main {{objective}} of this thesis was searching for optimal management in natural reservation Tesák, which should lead to preservation, eventually increasing and stabilization of silver fir's local population in the future. For these purposes there was carried out field mapping using Field-Map technology, which was targeted to most unsatisfactory part - segment B (from current conditions point of view). Information base for growth simulator Sibyla was formed by field investigation data. It was created and evaluated four alternative management scenarios. Best option was chosen based on their results. After 50. years of management, values of the variables were best with scenarios 4 and 3. These scenarios represented thrifty restoration interventions in spruce part of segment, fencing of <b>insolated</b> parts and underplanting with targeted tree species. A positive result was based mainly on silver fir appearance and its living specimen numbers in the area. At {{the same time there}} would be decline in the numbers of spruce - below 10 %, which would make possibility to classify segment B as naturalness degree III - close to nature...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to irradiance and illuminance calculations for discrete moments {{in time the}} VI-Suite can also create irradiance maps for periods of up to a year. Irradiance maps define the cumulative solar radiation power available at a point over the simulation period. The units are kWh/m 2 for total radiation and luxhours for visible radiation. A kWh/m 2 calculation can be useful for quantifying the solar potential of building surfaces for installing solar panels [17 – 19], {{to determine whether a}} surface is sufficiently <b>insolated</b> to invest in a photovoltaic panel and to locate the most favourable parts of a building to place one as the amount of power produced by a panel can be estimated by multiplying the kWh/m 2 value by a panel’s rated efficiency. Several research papers dealing with energy demand estimations benefited from such analyses [20 – 22]. Such simulations may also be used in automatic property valuation considering that solar radiation influences flat prices [23]. Other applications involving the computation of the solar exposure are urban planning [24, 25], thermal comfort [26], and detecting buildings that may be subject to overheating [27].|$|E
