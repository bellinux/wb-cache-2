40|$|Romania's {{international}} agrifood trade {{increased significantly}} {{during the last}} decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, {{for the first time}} in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily processed products and secondary processed products. A higher ratio of processed products in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country's food industry. The results for total trade show that the processed products represented at most 46 % of the Romanian exports, and at least 63 % of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to gauge the main trends in the {{evolution}} and structure of the EU trade in goods, mainly after 2004, starting from a quantitative analysis and comparing trends in the trade in goods with trends in the trade in services, where necessary. We focus on the trade of the EU- 27 as a group, but we stress the differences and similarities between the old member states (EU- 15) and the new member states (NMS) as well. Structured in seven parts, the paper reveals several noteworthy conclusions. Firstly, the EU remains the world trade leader; nevertheless, its market shares have been diminishing in the recent years, both in the export and import flows, due to a complex of factors. Secondly, the NMS shares in the EU trade flows have been growing; yet, the NMS shares in the exports and imports of the EU- 27 remain at a very low level. Besides, the normalized <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> of the NSM, compared with that of the EU- 15 underlines the different competitive advantages of the two groups. Thirdly, the trade deficit of the EU- 27 continues to deepen (the <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> deficit tripled in 2004 - 2008); however, there are significant differences between the manufactures <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> (with large surpluses) and the commodities <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> (with a deficit that doubled between 2004 and 2008). Fourth, the paper points out that the extra-EU exports and the imports are dominated by the manufactures; however the share of manufactures in the import flows is much smaller than that in the export flows. Finally, the present analysis traces evidence of the major impact of the global financial and economic crisis on the EU trade flows and the first signs of recovery.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1995 Austria's foreign trade {{can be divided into}} two separate areas: trade with the 14 other EU member states and trade with all other countries in the world. In 1994, intra-EU trade accounted for 65 percent of Austria's exports and 68 percent of imports. These shares exceed those of other EU member states. Thus, Austria's economy was closely linked to that of the EU through foreign trade even before accession to this group of countries. Intra-EU trade is favored vis-a-vis trade with third countries in a variety of ways: the abolishment of border controls, the elimination of variable import levies and tariffs on agricultural products and food, liberalization of public procurement, the abolishment of rules of origin and the simplification of technical provisions. Moreover, there is a tendency within the EU to impose anti-dumping tariffs on goods imported from successful competitors abroad. Suppliers from third countries are disadvantaged vis-a-vis sellers from within the EU at various levels. This {{was one of the reasons}} for Austria's decision to join the EU. In the recent past, Austria's trade with countries outside of the EU (<b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade)</b> has developed somewhat more dynamically than trade with EU countries (intra-EU trade) : in 1993 extra-EU exports rose by 3. 6 percent, while intra-EU exports declined by 7. 8 percent; in 1994 the figures were 11. 8 and 8. 4 percent. The difference can be attributed mainly to cyclical factors. After accession to the EU, Austria's intra-EU trade ought to grow faster than <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> thanks to more favorable conditions within the EU. This is likely to be the case in agricultural trade. As far as trade with manufacturing products is concerned, the impact of the improvement in trade relations might only be felt after some delay. <b>Extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> (35 percent of total exports, 32 percent of total imports) might for analytical purposes be broken down into two parts: trade with countries "associated" with the EU (the remainder of the EFTA countries, the six countries of East-Central Europe with Europe agreements, as well the ACP countries), and trade with third countries. The countries of East-Central Europe associated with the EU accounted for 26 percent of Austria's extra-EU exports and 18 percent of extra-EU imports. The EFTA countries contributed 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, to Austria's <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade.</b> From Austria's perspective, the grouping of the overseas departments (DOM/TOM, e. g., the Canary Islands, Madeira), as well as the ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean region, the Pacific region) is new. The latter group consists mainly of the former colonies of the founding members of the European Common Market. These countries enjoy special access to the markets of EU countries. At present, foreign trade with these countries is negligible, but might gain in importance in the future. Among the not associated third countries are the developing countries overseas (with a share of 22 percent in <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade)</b> and the not associated countries of Eastern Europe (8 percent). Industrialized countries overseas account for 19 percent of extra-EU exports and 33 percent of extra-EU imports. Austria's accession to the EU means that the compilation of statistics on trade with EU countries can no longer be based on data as recorded at the border but must be compiled at the firm level based on value added tax returns (Intrastat). Statistics on trade with third countries (Extrastat) will be gathered as before at the border. The changeover to the new system is creating substantial difficulties. For some time no data on foreign trade will be available; this comes at an inopportune time when the current account is turning negative. At the moment it is still unclear how the system of national accounts might be used to substitute for the foreign trade statistics.

We also find bidirectional causality between the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and the real exchange rate in the long-run. The real exchange rate also causes the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in the short-run. In an out-of-sample forecasting experiment, we also find that real exchange rate contains useful information that can explain future movements in the <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> <b>trade</b> balance; real exchange rates; cointegration; J-curve; Granger causality; forecasting; Mauritius; UK; United Kingdom. ...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} indicates that MNCs may be engaging in income shifting practices. Such practices could bias the <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> if the intrafirm trade is substantial. This article examines {{the effect of the}} tax differential on the <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> of OECD countries. The results indicate that the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> is adversely affected when the tax differential is positive, for a number of countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> {{outcomes of the}} EPA/EBAI policies in the SADC region using the GTAP 7 model and database. The analysis of these policies therefore make conclusion on SADC member states’ changes in <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> overall, per commodity groups and on overall welfare outcomes {{as a result of}} these policies. The study has found that although the EPA/EBAI initiative policies will potentially result in overall welfare gain in the SADC region this welfare gain will only be 6 % of the EU 27. Analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> outcome reveals that the SADC ACP region will suffer a negative <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> of US$ 1596. 8 million with the EU on the other hand having a positive <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> of US$ 105. 61 million. Since a positive <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> is important for sustainable development of nations, these results once again throw into doubt the potential sustainable economic growth benefits of these policies to ACP countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the relationship between}} the exchange value of the Chinese Renminbi (RMG) and China's <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> by means of some recent econometric techniques designed to evaluate the existence and the direction of causality. We find strong evidence suggesting that changes in the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and each of its components Granger-cause changes in the exchange rate but no evidence indicating a causal link running from the exchange rate to the <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> Our results seem to be rather supportive of the accommodative role of the exchange rate proposed by the modern theory of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> determination and not supportive of the existence of a J-curve in China's <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> Our finding of a bidirectional causal relationship between the real exchange rate and the price variables confirms the presence of a vicious circle hypothesis following currency devaluation. This has important implications for the discussions of impacts of the RMB devaluation on China's <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> ...|$|R
