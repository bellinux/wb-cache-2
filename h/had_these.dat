The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to their {{objectives}} and consequently they were blocked at strategic points. Many of the road-blocks formed by Ironside were semi-permanent. In many cases, Brooke <b>had</b> <b>these</b> removed altogether, as experience had shown {{they could be}} {{as much of an}} impediment to friends as to foes. Brooke favoured removable blocks.|$|E

Connick designed the windows in consultation with Friend, but they were made by others after the former's death.|$|E

5|$|From April, Marquis began {{collecting}} artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects {{that had been}} taken from the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, the fact that the Cheyennes would even admit that they <b>had</b> <b>these</b> objects was a measure of the trust Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including scalping knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield. Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian medicine was a jailable offense.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters <b>had</b> <b>these</b> scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|On both ships, {{two more}} quadruple sets of 1.1in guns were added {{in place of}} two {{searchlights}} amidships. After she was torpedoed in 1942, North Carolina <b>had</b> <b>these</b> removed and ten quadruple sets of 40mm guns added. Fourteen were present by June 1943, while a fifteenth mount was added {{on top of the}} third main turret that November. Washington retained its six 1.1in quads until the middle of 1943, when ten quad 40mm guns replaced them. By August, she had fifteen. The two ships carried these through to the close of the war.|$|E

5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he <b>had</b> <b>these</b> documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotters}} {{were initially}} equipped with Teleradio 3A sets and amateur equipment; however, many outstations later <b>had</b> <b>these</b> replaced by improved 3B and 3BZ sets to provide higher power communications. This occurred following {{a decision to}} standardise on the 3B following {{the formation of the}} NGAWW. In addition, some teams operating in more difficult jungle and mountain terrain, such as that closer to Port Moresby, were equipped with RAAF supplied ATR-2 radios which were lighter than the Teleradio 3A sets provided to the more distant outstations.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they <b>had</b> <b>these</b> weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
