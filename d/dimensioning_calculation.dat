40|$|Recommendations for {{dimensioning}} of {{pile foundations}} for noise protection walls in embankments were proposed. This report combines findings {{from various sources}} and offers a semi-empirical dimensioning process. In a study of literature, model tests, large-scale tests, dimensioning methods based on test loads and various theoretical models were analysed. Furthermore, a few model tests were carried out to verify the kinematics. The safety concept accordingto the new DIN 1054 (draft of 14 / 08 / 92) was taken into consideration. Subsequently a dimensioning method was proposed and checked {{by means of a}} data bank established within the framework of this study. The proposed dimensioning method is based on a bearing capacity corresponding to the ultimate limit state of construction parts. It was established that the serviceability limit state can be covered with the partial safety coefficients and with a load increase factor by means of the verification of the bearing capacity so that the permanent tilting after 10. 000 load cycles is smaller than 1 %. Verification of overall stability is not necessary according to a simple comparative analysis by Vogt. The proposed dimensioning process was described in the following chapters: application limits, soil parameters, verification of bearing capacity, verification of serviceability, procedure in <b>dimensioning,</b> <b>calculation</b> examples. Some recommendations on the design of noise protection walls and a proposal of wind load assumption were also presented. A verification of the calculation procedure {{on the basis of the}} test loads and the source code of a computer program, with which the in situ tests were computed, are in the appendix. (orig.)

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{calibration}} or the adjustment of safety factors for the dimensioning of wooden building constructions. The first part of the thesis presents and explains the basic concepts on which the whole procedure of safety factors’ calibration is based. This includes the definitions of the following concepts: construction reliability, collapse probability, reliability index and others. Two simple calculations of construction reliability and a basic example, where the construction response is divided subjectively, are presented. There is a description of the first order method second moment. The thesis also presents an example of the Eurocode 5 Standard where the equation for the dimensioning of wooden constructions and the boundary condition function are explained. By using the boundary condition function and the first order method second moment, we can determine the collapse probability, which increases if the reliability index is decreased. At the same time the target indexes of reliability suggested by the Eurocode and chosen according to the importance of the wooden construction in question are also stated. The following section includes the descriptions of all types of safety factors’ calibrations, their purpose and the conditions of use. The last section concretely presents the <b>dimensioning</b> <b>calculation</b> of a simple wooden construction as recommended by Eurocode 5. For the simple calculation example mentioned above, the indexes of reliability for a one-year reference period have been calculated with the computer programme CodeCal. The recommended partial safety factors according to Eurocode 5 have been optimised for this concrete case {{on the basis of the}} chosen target reliability index and a typical ratio between permanent and prevailing variable burdening. As expected the optimised partial safety factors of this concrete case are smaller, however this is does not provide sufficient grounds to change the basic equation of Eurocode 5...|$|E
