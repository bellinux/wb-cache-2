5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

500|$|Owing to {{the strange}} {{nature of the}} language, the Century 21 writers would brief Unwin on episode plots and then leave space in their scripts for the actor to draft all the Unwinese {{dialogue}} himself. Shane Rimmer, who scripted the episode [...] "Hole in One", remarked that [...] "A lot of [...] you had to leave to [...] You gave him a line of patter that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> what he does.

500|$|Brocklebank {{explained}} the dynamic {{between the two}} characters: Paul finds it [...] "extremely difficult" [...] {{to be in a}} secretive relationship because he wants different things in a relationship. When Paul does his drag act [...] "Thelma Louise" [...] in the local pub, he mentions that he is a secret relationship. This annoys Ivan and an argument ensues in the toilets. However, Paul has accidentally left his microphone on and Ivan is outed to the whole pub. Brocklebank said that Ivan feels [...] "upset and betrayed" [...] and [...] "deep down he knows he’s bisexual but isn’t sure if a relationship is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Paul" [...] as he cannot conform to Paul's ideas about relationships.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to deflect the pressure, Carney and PRTEU {{contacted}} [...] Virginia congressman Howard W.

Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC, quickly scheduled a hearing. In the meantime, the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order, and the PTC management told Ross that, given the union's position, the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either. [...] The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944. The hearing was inconclusive, with Ross reiterating the FEPC position, and the union representatives falling back on the [...] "customs clause" [...] and their claims about seniority issues. Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed: [...] "We are not going to accept them [...] as fellow workers. ... We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> them. If anybody believe it, let them try it". A petition, signed by 1776 workers, presented at the hearing, read: [...] "Gentlemen: We, the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co., refuse to work with Negroes as motormen, conductors, operators and station trainmen".|$|E
500|$|Following {{several months}} of rumours {{regarding}} the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Wareing to launch his only solo restaurant, and he would take on Pétrus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards. Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH, and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow, but later {{admitted that he had}} engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own. The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and feud between the three parties, which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; [...] "half of me thinks he’s a sad bastard and the other half still adores him." [...] He went on to describe Ramsay as a celebrity chef who wasn't involved in the industry anymore. The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the Pétrus name, and Wareing signing a gag order regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Wareing remarked of the situation, [...] "If I never speak to that guy again {{for the rest of my}} life, it wouldn't bother me one bit." [...] Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing [...] "all the best". Wareing's self-named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009, was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and was named Time Out's restaurant of the year in 2010. The new Pétrus was opened around the corner from the Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge. Ramsay later joked, that with Heston Blumenthal also opening his new restaurant nearby, the three of them could [...] "all have a fight in the street at four in the morning".|$|E

When Avicii sent his track out to have a song written over it I totally fell in love with this version and I think he's super talented." [...] Syco also responded to the claim, stating that Avicii was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Lewis, and that he would be credited on the song. In response, Avicii accused Lewis and her label of lying about working together, and tweeted [...] "Thanks for accusing me of lying and speaking on my behalf. Since we never met or even spoke, please let me and my manager know who told you that and what confirmation they gave you." [...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist. Avicii and his record label were pleased with the result, with the former saying [...] "Glad to FINALLY have resolved situation with Leona. Music is the answer...
