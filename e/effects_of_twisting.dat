40|$|Yarn {{twist in}} textile {{technology}} {{is an important}} characteristic since it considerably affects the properties of knitted or woven fabrics.

40|$|Magnetic twist {{is thought}} to play an {{important}} role in many structures of the solar atmosphere. One <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> is to modify the properties of the eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions are characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement along the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the development of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is oscillating laterally. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced either by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of the sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube, or either by the continuous small length-scales produced by phase-mixing when there is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> is consistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the process of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist always delays the appearance of the shear instability but for tubes with thin inhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values <b>of</b> <b>twist.</b> On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> is much stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations of transverse kink modes and the KHI itself. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ (11 - 22 - 2017...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to review literature for the most suitable aeroelastic tailoring analysis tools for long slender composite structures, and integrate them into an aeroelastic tailoring process. The JS 1 C Revelation is a high performance sailplane made from modern composites, mostly carbon fibre. This has the advantage of being more rigid than traditional engineering materials, thereby reducing the effects of the twisting deflections on these long slender structures due to aerodynamic loads. The implementing of aeroelastic tailoring can create bend-twist couples for performance improvements. Composites enable the use of aeroelastic tailoring to improve gliding performance. Flaperon 3 of the JS 1 C 21 m was used as the design problem for aeroelastic tailoring. Aeroelastic tailoring was done by analysing the flaperon structure at the different layup angles to determine the correct design point to tailor the structure to improve aerodynamic performance at thermalling and cruise, but mostly cruise since it accounts for 70 % of the flight time. The composite structure analysis tool has the objective to get results during concept design. This directed the line of research of analysis tools to a solution method of two dimensional cross-section mesh properties projected onto a one dimensional beam. The literature of Hodges had good verification and published data on the analysis tools. The analysis tools comprised of three programs that were not very user friendly. Thus the author compiled a Matlab program as a user interface tool to run the three programs together. The aeroelastic tailoring process systematically works through the known design variables and objectives, which are given as inputs to the analysis tool. The analysis tool plots the coupling data versus layup angle. From this the best layup angles for a sought-after bend-twist couple is used to aeroelastically tailor the wing. The composite structure analysis tool’s accuracy was verified by analysing cantilever beam deflections and comparing the results with hand calculations and SolidWorks Simulation FEM results. The analysis tool’s accuracy was further verified by comparing the aerodynamic torsional load’s twist deflections with thin walled tube theory. The analysis tool was validated by applying a torsional load at the tip of a JS 1 C production Flaperon 3 in an experimental setup and then comparing this result with the Flaperon 3 modelled in the analysis tool. These comparisons also ensured that the model’s composite material properties and the meshing of the flaperon cross-sectional properties were correct. This aeroelastic tailoring was validated with the advantage of then being used to improve the aerodynamic performance of the JS 1 C Revelation 21 m tip’s flaperon. This improvement could be made by making use of a tailored bend-twist couple to reduce the effect of the aerodynamic load’s twist deflections. A test sample of the JS 1 C 21 m flaperon 3 was used to validate aeroelastic tailoring. The test sample was designed to be 1 m in length and have all the specified tailoring coupling characteristics that could improve the aerodynamic performance of the JS 1 C 21 m flaperon 3. The test sample was manufactured according to Jonker Sailplanes manufacturing standards and experimentally set up with the same applied deflections as in the analysis tool. The calculated bend-twist values and the experimental setup results were similar with a negligible difference, assuming small displacements and an aspect ratio greater than 13; this confirmed that the PreVABS/VABS/GEBT composite structure analysis tool could be used in aeroelastic tailoring to predict and design the bend-twist couple needed to improve the aerodynamic performance of the JS 1 C 21 m. While the twist behaviour of Flaperon 3 was improved by the tailored bend-twist couple, it was still necessary to add pre-twist as well, to fully address the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> by aerodynamic forces.

The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>twist</b> on fatigue life were also small. Indeed, some twist seemed to improve fatigue performance, perhaps because the contact between links was displaced from the region of high residual (compressive and tensile) stress resulting from proof loading during manufacture.
