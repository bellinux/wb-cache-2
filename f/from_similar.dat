5|$|Dysprosium carbonate, Dy2(CO3)3, and {{dysprosium}} sulfate, Dy2(SO4)3, result <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy2(C2O4)3·10H2O) {{are both}} insoluble in water. Two {{of the most}} abundant dysprosium carbonates, tengerite-(Dy) (Dy2(CO3)3·2–3H2O) and kozoite-(Dy) (DyCO3(OH)) are known to form via a poorly ordered (amorphous) precursor phase with a formula of Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O. This amorphous precursor consists of highly hydrated spherical nanoparticles of 10–20nm diameter that are exceptionally stable under dry treatment at ambient and high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in hoverflies in 1995, motion camouflage by minimising optic flow {{has been demonstrated}} in another insect order, dragonflies, {{as well as in}} two groups of vertebrates, falcons and echolocating bats. Since bats hunting at night cannot be using the strategy for camouflage, it has been named, describing its mechanism, as constant absolute target direction. This is an efficient homing strategy, and {{it has been suggested that}} anti-aircraft missiles could benefit <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{its members}} were {{directly}} elected {{for the first}} time. This sets it apart <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> institutions {{such as those of}} the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its President. Veil was also the first female President of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.|$|E

5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi can be {{distinguished}} <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M.frustrata resembles young specimens of M.snyderi, but the ridges of the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20–29 by 14–19µm. Another potential lookalike, M.brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can be {{separated}} <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may {{be confused with}} P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it relatively easy to distinguish between the two.|$|E

5|$|Purcell joined LucasArts in 1988 as {{an artist}} and game designer, where he was {{approached}} about contributing to LucasArts' new quarterly newsletter, The Adventurer, a publication designed to inform customers about upcoming LucasArts games and company news. From its debut issue in 1990 to 1996, Purcell created twelve comic strips for the newsletter. The strips portrayed a variety of stories, <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> plots as in the comic books to parodies of LucasArts games such as Monkey Island and Full Throttle and the Lucasfilm franchises Star Wars and Indiana Jones.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{focuses on}} Morricone's lesser-known soundtrack work, with Ipecac founder Mike Patton consciously wishing to distance it <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> compilations. Released on October18, 2005, Crime and Dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics. The album has attracted comments on Morricone's experimental and innovative compositional style, often {{in contrast to}} the spare-sounding westerns he is known for.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{the entry}} is written in {{continuous}} prose, starting with a physical description giving length, weight, and {{a detailed account of}} plumage with differences between the sexes (more than a page in the cirl bunting's case). Montagu then describes the species' distribution, nesting (nest structure, number of eggs, nesting period), differences <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> species, and other observations.|$|E
5|$|Weber has a brother, Brandon, who is {{two years}} younger than him and grew up playing hockey with Shea's former Predators {{teammate}} Cody Franson. When Weber was 14, his mother was diagnosed with brain cancer, which surgery mostly removed. She later began suffering <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> symptoms, however, and in early 2010 {{had a series of}} seizures. Weber's mother was placed in an induced coma, and died on August 11, 2010.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{learns that}} she has a {{cancerous}} tumor between her sinus and cerebrum. She initially tells only Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) of the diagnosis, and is determined to continue to work. The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{television}} {{networks in the}} United States were restricted to owning {{no more than five}} local VHF television stations. This system, which evolved <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in executives of {{television networks}} forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network programs across the U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; Paramount Television Network staff required affiliate station managers to sign a network contract even if the station only aired one Paramount program. At its peak in late 1950, the Paramount Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations. Most Paramount stations were in the United States, but at least two were Canadian stations.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Australia {{won their}} first two gold medals, the first time any {{southern}} hemisphere country had won an event. Australia's maiden gold came in highly unlikely circumstances. Steven Bradbury, {{a member of the}} bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating on 17 February when all of his competitors in the 1,000m final crashed out on the final turn while jostling for the medal positions. He had qualified for the final after benefiting <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> incidents and disqualifications in the quarter and semifinals. Bradbury came third in his quarterfinal and would have been eliminated, but world champion Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstruction and the Australian progressed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} official languages (German, French, and Italian) have terms, {{not used}} outside of Switzerland, known as Helvetisms. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, {{a large group}} of words typical of Swiss Standard German, which do not appear either in Standard German, nor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's surrounding language cultures (German Billett from French), <b>from</b> <b>similar</b> term in another language (Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion). The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as Helvetisms. The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, phrases, and pronunciation, but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise. Duden, one of the prescriptive sources for Standard German, is aware of about 3000 Helvetisms. Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse, include several hundred Helvetisms.|$|E
