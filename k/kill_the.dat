5|$|<b>Kill</b> <b>the</b> Irishman {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1997. Producer Tommy Reid heard that Rick Porrello, an Ohio policeman, was about to publish a book about Greene called To <b>Kill</b> <b>the</b> Irishman.

The meeting went well, and on March 17, 1998, they signed a deal for the film rights to the book. Getting <b>Kill</b> <b>the</b> Irishman produced was difficult. Reid frequently left deals unconcluded, and discovered that the script he’d commissioned was attached to a cover with another screenwriter and producer’s name listed. According to Reid, this was a common occurrence in Hollywood, and {{he claims to have}} spent over $1 million to ensure the film was made.|$|E
