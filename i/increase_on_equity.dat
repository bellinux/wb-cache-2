40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} the results of research in the field of financial analysis focusing on leverage as a way to <b>increase</b> return <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> Analysis was conducted on the sample of agricultural enterprises in Slovakia for the period 2007 - 2011. We aimed to assess the number and percentage of firms, in which increase of liabilities would contribute to growth in benefit for the owner measured by ROE. We found that only in the case of approx. 20 % of businesses, it makes sense to increase the share of foreign capital in order to <b>increase</b> return <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> The period since 2008 is characterized by a decrease in interest rates under the influence of the drop in the interest rates of central banks. Reducing the cost of foreign capital increases its attractiveness and leads to the growth of the share of foreign capital to finance business needs...|$|R

The {{results indicate that the}} banks most reliant on activities that generate noninterest income do not earn higher average equity returns, but are much more risky as measured by return volatility (both total and idiosyncratic) and market betas. This suggests that the pervasive shift toward noninterest income has not improved the risk/return outcomes of U. S. banks in recent years. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} extent to which the equity markets of Hungary, Poland the Czech Republic and Russia have become less segmented. Using a variety of tests it is shown there has been a {{consistent}} increase in the co-movement of some Eastern European markets and developed markets. Using the variance decompositions from a vector autoregressive representation of returns it is shown that for Poland and Hungary global factors are having an <b>increasing</b> influence <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> returns, suggestive of increased equity market integration. In this paper we model a system of bivariate equity market correlations as a smooth transition logistic trend model in order to establish how rapidly the countries of Eastern Europe are moving away from market segmentation. We find that Hungary is the country which is becoming integrated the most quickly. © 2005 ELsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with prudent risk-taking and the attraction of new clients in advanced economies like the United States, where shadow banks are not regulated. Researchers have contended that freedom from regulation encourages risk-taking and earning of higher profits, but {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence addressing this relationship. The purpose of this quantitative study was to investigate whether lack of regulations result in <b>increased</b> return <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> The theoretical framework was regulatory arbitrage by Ricks M, Gennaioli N, Shleifer A, and Vishny R. The research question addressed the relationship between regulation, profit margin, leverage, asset turnover, economic condition, and strategy, and the bottom-line of banks (traditional and shadow) as measured by return <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> A quasi-experimental design was used to examine data from 42 annual returns filed using Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10 -K from U. S. banks with Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 6021 and 6211. Multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Results indicated that regulation did not show any significant correlation with the bottom-line of banks as measured by return <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> However, there was a significant correlation between the bottom-line banks and other independent variables including profit margin, leverage, and asset turnover. This study contributes to positive social change by assisting regulators and lawmakers in improving their roles in regulating traditional and shadow banks, thereby reducing the likelihood of crises in the U.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have argued that the thrift {{industry}} is not viable as it is presently structured and regulated because mortgage yields are inadequate to cover interest and operating costs. This hypothesis suggests that observed profitability is primarily the result of the tendency of the industry to "ride" the yield curve by borrowing short and lending long. To evaluate this argument, we construct a simultaneous-equations model of thrift risk (maturity gap positions) and return (net interest margin). We find support for the notion that the industry could not be reasonably profitable if it did not take on significant interest-rate risk. For instance, a zero gap position produces a return on assets of only 19 basis points and a return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> of only 4 %. We also estimate the amount of interest-rate risk the industry can employ to <b>increase</b> returns <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> and assets. Our estimates show that over 50 % of thrift profits earned during this period are the result of negative gap positions and interest-rate speculation. As earlier research shows, changes in regulations affecting thrift asset and liability choices can be counterproductive. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study how}} a stock index can affect {{corporate}} behavior by {{functioning as a}} source of prestige. After decades of low corporate profitability, the JPX-Nikkei 400 index was introduced in Japan in 2014. Each year the index selected 400 large and liquid firms deemed to be best-performing in terms of profitability; membership is considered highly prestigious. We document that index-inclusion incentives have led firms to <b>increase</b> return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> proportionally by 41 %, via higher margins, efficiency, or shareholder payouts, depending on where they had slack, but not by changing investments or accruals. These incentives are driven by the prestige associated with the index, rather than capital-market benefits. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that the index-inclusion incentives accounted for 16 % of the average increase in aggregate annual earnings over our sample period and 20 % of the growth in aggregate market capitalization. These findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which longstanding corporate behaviors can be transformed...|$|R

These firms have experienced significant growth in Italy, {{partly as a}} result of public contributions. The objective of the research is to analyze the management of biogas plant firms by analyzing annual accounts as the main document of use to third parties for the evaluation of a firm’s management. The research, conducted on a sample of 22 firms using 110 year-data, has highlighted that economic and financial margins are different, though often statistically correlated. The research shows that profitability and cash generation in the biogas plant industry are high, even if the generation of cash flow is less than the return <b>on</b> <b>equity,</b> and there are firm cases of having difficulty in financial debt repayment, even in the presence of positive economic margins. The research also shows that return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> greatly exceeds the performance of Italian government bonds and of the majority of industrial sectors; this result points to the significant <b>increase</b> in returns <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> capital in the industry, potentially damaging other sectors, and highlighting the risk of the distortive use of public resources...|$|R

Three value drivers are defined: profitability, growth and risk. The determinants include variables on performance measurement, control systems, perceived uncertainty, competition, success factors, products, strategy, size, industry, and age. The data, which were extracted from a survey of Finnish firms, consisted of responses from 59 Family-Owned Firms (FOFs) and 34 Non-Family-Owned Firms (NFOFs). The multivariate GLM {{was used as a}} statistical method. Empirical analysis showed that value creation logic in FOFs differs from that in NFOFs. In NFOFs value creation is more growth-oriented and in FOFs more profitability-oriented. Different determinants affect the value drivers in these groups.

40|$|Background: Recent {{changes in}} Ontario public health policy call for <b>increased</b> {{emphasis}} <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> However, {{it is not}} clear how equity is understood as a concept and how equity is understood as practice. Methods: The aim of this study was to understand public health frontline staff (FLS) perspectives <b>on</b> health <b>equity</b> and how these align with provincial public health policy documents. A qualitative content analysis design was used to examine transcripts from six focus group interviews with frontline public health workers and seven key provincial public health documents that have shaped or influenced public health program planning in Ontario. Perceptions and understandings of health equity in public health were compared. Results: Findings from the study indicate that several areas of alignment exist between how FLS describe equity in public health practice and how equity is addressed in the provincial policy documents; both focus their discussion of equity as relating to the social determinants of health and priority populations. Several differences between FLS perspectives and policy documents were also identified including barriers encountered in FLS daily practice that are not addressed in the provincial policy documents. Conclusions: These alignments and differences provide insights on how FLS incorporate information from provincial policy documents into their practice and suggest the importance of involving FLS in the policy process...|$|R

Two different stock market models are developed to estimate the model, a basic firm’s stock market model and a modified Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM). The explanatory variables include risk factors, non risk stock characteristics, and corporate environmental policy, conduct and performance. This study uses Newsweek’s 2009 Green Ranking scores. The results show that risk factors, non-risk stock characteristics, and environmental scores variables are statistically significant in affecting stock price and equity return. The willingness to pay (WTP) are 3 ¢, 5 ¢, and 18 ¢, respectively for the green policy and performance score (GPPS), the reputation survey score (RSS), and the green score (GS).

It allows an international comparison on banking regulation, capturing changes on public policies towards banks over time further, it encompasses {{one of the major}} financial crises since 1929. The impact of regulatory capital requirements on banking efficiency is assessed using the stochastic frontier production function for panel data to estimate inefficiency effects. It is used a panel dataset of 865 observations from 156 publicly listed commercial banks operating in 30 countries and covering a nine year time-horizon (2004 - 2012). Besides the impact on capital regulation, we also controlled for the influence of other regulatory variables, macroeconomic conditions, market structure characteristics and the state of financial development. Our results suggest that capital requirements negatively affect inefficiency, meaning that, for our sample, an <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> regulatory <b>equity</b> ratios will lead to an efficiency improvement. Regarding other regulatory control variables, we would say that regulation should aim to increase market discipline, while restricting banks activities.

In the case of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia has successfully implemented a merger program for Malaysian banks in order {{to compete in the}} face of financial deregulation brought about by globalization. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide additional insights into the improvement of a bank’s financial situation, i. e. commercial banks, due to the recent series of bank mergers in Malaysia. This paper presents an application of the model for the financial analysis of a bank based on the DuPont system of financial analysis presented in Saunders (2000). Bank return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> is decomposed into net profit margin, total asset turnover and the equity multiplier. This model is applied to Maybank in Malaysia which is one of the ten anchor banks in Malaysia that must satisfy the requirement of having a minimum RM 2 billion shareholders fund and a minimum total assets of RM 25 billion. Over the period of study from 1998 to 2003, during which substantial financial difficulties existed, Maybank’s assets rose gradually. Both income and expenses dropped during the study period with unusually large decreases in expenses in 2000 because decreases in both interest expense and loan loss and provision. This combination leads to an increase in net profit margin and a subsequent <b>increase</b> in return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> leading to an increase in the stock price.

As the environmental performance, our study considers the two different environmental issues of waste and greenhouse gas emissions in capturing the effects of corporate environmental management on financial performance. In addition, to clarify how each financial performance responds to a firm’s effort in dealing with different environmental issues, we utilize many financial performance indices reflecting various market evaluations. Our estimation results show the different effects of each environmental performance on financial performances. For example, while an increase in waste emissions generally improves financial performance, their reduction ameliorates financial performance in dirty industries. In addition, while greenhouse gas reduction leads to an <b>increase</b> in return <b>on</b> <b>equity,</b> {{it does not have}} a significant effect on return on sales which reflects the evaluation in the goods market, and it leads to a decrease in the natural logarithm of Tobin’s q, which indicates the value of intangible assets. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{explore what}} {{happened}} to poor women in Bangladesh once they reached a hospital providing comprehensive emergency obstetric care (EmOC) and to identify support mechanisms. Design: Mixed methods qualitative study. Setting: Large government medical college hospital in Bangladesh. Sample: Providers and users of EmOC. Methods: Ethnographic observation in obstetrics unit including interviews with staff and women using the unit and their carers. Results: Women had to mobilise significant financial and social resources to fund out of pocket expenses. Poorer women faced greater challenges in receiving treatment as relatives were less able to raise the necessary cash. The official financial support mechanism was bureaucratic and largely unsuitable in emergency situations. Doctors operated a less formal ‘‘poor fund’’ system to help the poorest women. There was no formal assessment of poverty; rather, doctors made ‘‘adjudications’’ of women’s need for support based on severity of condition and presence of friends and relatives. Limited resources led to a ‘‘wait and see’’ policy that meant women’s condition could deteriorate before help was provided. Conclusions: Greater consideration {{must be given to}} what happens at health facilities to ensure that (1) using EmOC does not further impoverish families; and (2) the ability to pay does not influence treatment. Developing alternative finance mechanisms to reduce the burden of out of pocket expenses is crucial but challenging.

The tool that evaluates the suitability to indebt in order to reach a higher rentability is the equity multiplier indicator. An analysis of the multiplier was carried out on 10 years of data from 456 Czech companies. Based on the data from these companies the influence of two components of the multiplier, which characterise the influence of indebtedness on the return <b>on</b> <b>equity,</b> was analysed. These components are “financial leverage” and “interest burden”, these having an antagonistic effect. The low variability of the equity multiplier is apparent in the companies of the administrative and support service sector and it is also relatively low in the companies of the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector; on the contrary, in for example the professional, scientific and technical activities and the sector of water, sewage and waste there are companies with higher variability of the equity multiplier.
