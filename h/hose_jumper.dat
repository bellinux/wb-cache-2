25|$|The Los Angeles Fire Department has it {{origins in}} the year 1871. In September of that year, George M. Fall, the County Clerk for Los Angeles County {{organized}} Engine Company No. 1. It was a volunteer firefighting force with an Amoskeag fire engine and a <b>hose</b> <b>jumper</b> (cart). The equipment was hand-drawn to fires. In the spring of 1874, the fire company asked the Los Angeles City Council to purchase horses to pull the engine. The Council refused and the fire company disbanded.|$|E
50|$|During operation, the Thistle Alpha {{platform}} fed {{oil to the}} SALM {{through a}} pair of 16-inch pipelines. This hard piping ran up the base from opposing sides and terminated {{at the bottom of}} the riser near the first U-joint articulation. From that point the oil bridged the articulation through a pair of very thick 16-inch flexible <b>jumper</b> <b>hoses,</b> then continued up the riser through more hard piping, and over the riser-buoy articulation through another set of <b>jumper</b> <b>hoses.</b> From there, the oil flowed through product hoses to the shuttle tanker which was moored to the buoy.|$|R
50|$|Alexander flew to Aberdeen, and by {{the next}} day he was taken out to the diving support vessel Tender Carrier in the Thistle Field. On board the Carrier, Alexander {{ultimately}} decided to have the <b>jumper</b> <b>hoses</b> blown off with explosives. Explosives experts were brought out to the ship with their gear and divers placed clamshell charges around the <b>jumper</b> <b>hoses.</b> On January 23, 1979, the signal was given and Alexander heard a bang and saw bubbles come to the surface. A diver was sent down to have a look and discovered that, although both charges had gone off, only one of the hoses had been cut.|$|R
50|$|On January 17, 1979, it was {{reported}} that the buoy was not standing up straight anymore. A diver was sent down to investigate and discovered that the U-joint pin had fallen out. The only thing keeping the buoy from floating away were the <b>jumper</b> <b>hoses</b> bridging the articulation. Three days later, after the buoy sustained more flooding, a diver reported that the buoy was now actually grounding on top of the riser.|$|R
50|$|Using an {{ultrasonic}} probe (CTRL UL101), Foale traced the leak on Sunday 10 January to a vacuum <b>jumper</b> <b>hose</b> {{connected to a}} multipaned window in the US segment of the station. The search for the leak had been hampered by noise emitted from scientific equipment on board. Successful identification and repair of the leak narrowly averted a planned lock down of the station {{in an attempt to}} isolate the leak, which would have affected station operations. Experts believe the leak was caused by astronauts using the hose as a handhold.|$|R
40|$|During {{assembly}} of the International Space Station, the Internal Thermal Control Systems in adjacent modules are connected by <b>jumper</b> <b>hoses</b> referred to as integrated hose assemblies (IHAs). A test of an IHA has been performed at the Marshall Space Flight Center {{to determine whether the}} pressure in an IHA filled with heat transfer fluid would exceed the maximum design pressure when subjected to elevated temperatures (up to 60 C (140 F)) that may be experienced during storage or transportation. The results of the test show that the pressure in the IHA remains below 227 kPa (33 psia) (well below the 689 kPa (100 psia) maximum design pressure) even at a temperature of 71 C (160 F), with no indication of leakage or damage to the hose. Therefore, {{based on the results of}} this test, the IHA can safely be filled with coolant prior to launch. The test and results are documented in this Technical Memorandum...|$|R
