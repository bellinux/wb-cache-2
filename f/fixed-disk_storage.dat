40|$|Although {{extensive}} {{knowledge of}} space station design exists, {{the information is}} widely dispersed. The Space Station Freedom Program (SSFP) needs policies and procedures that ensure the use of consistent design objectives throughout its organizational hierarchy. The System Design Tradeoff Model (SDTM) produces {{information that can be}} used for this purpose. SDTM is a mathematical model of a set of possible designs for Space Station Freedom. Using the SDTM program, one can find the particular design which provides specified amounts of resources to Freedom's users at the lowest total (or life cycle) cost. One can also compare alternative design concepts by changing the set of possible designs, while holding the specified user services constant, and then comparing costs. Finally, both costs and user services can be varied simultaneously when comparing different designs. SDTM selects its solution from a set of feasible designs. Feasibility constraints include safety considerations, minimum levels of resources required for station users, budget allocation requirements, time limitations, and Congressional mandates. The total, or life cycle, cost includes all of the U. S. costs of the station: design and development, purchase of hardware and software, assembly, and operations throughout its lifetime. The SDTM development team has identified, for a variety of possible space station designs, the subsystems that produce the resources to be modeled. The team has also developed formulas for the cross consumption of resources by other resources, as functions of the amounts of resources produced. SDTM can find the values of station resources, so that subsystem designers can choose new design concepts that further reduce the station's life cycle cost. The fundamental input to SDTM is a set of formulas that describe the subsystems which make up a reference design. Most of the formulas identify how the resources required by each subsystem depend upon the size of the subsystem. Some of the formulas describe how the subsystem costs depend on size. The formulas can be complicated and nonlinear (if nonlinearity is needed to describe how designs change with size). SDTM's outputs are amounts of resources, life-cycle costs, and marginal costs. SDTM will run on IBM PC/XTs, ATs, and 100 % compatibles with 640 K of RAM and at least 3 Mb of <b>fixed-disk</b> <b>storage.</b> A printer which can print in 132 -column mode is also required, and a mathematics co-processor chip is highly recommended. This code is written in Turbo C 2. 0. However, since the developers used a modified version of the proprietary Vitamin C source code library, the complete source code is not available. The executable is provided, along with all non-proprietary source code. This program was developed in 1989...|$|E
