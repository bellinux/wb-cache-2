5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh, and he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E
25|$|The {{salmon is}} an {{important}} creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon of Knowledge plays {{key role in the}} tale The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn. In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of knowledge to whoever eats it, and is sought by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare it for him. However, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon {{is also one of the}} incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill and Fintan mac Bóchra.|$|E
500|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the start of the 2011–12 season, Samuelsson played six games for Vancouver before being traded away on October 22, 2011. He was sent back to Florida for his second stint with the Panthers, along with fellow veteran forward Marco Sturm, in {{exchange}} for forwards David Booth and Steven Reinprecht, as well as a third-round draft pick in 2013. In an interview with HockeySverige.se at the end of the season, he told Swedish reporters that while he enjoyed playing in Vancouver, competing alongside countrymen Alexander Edler and the Sedins in particular, he [...] "didn't think very highly of management." [...] He also criticized Alexandre Burrows for his actions during the Finals, when he bit Patrice Bergeron's finger after the Bruins forward had put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> citing it a rallying point for the Bruins in their defeat of the Canucks.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{repeated}} the word, seemed to roll <b>it</b> round <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{with a sort}} of wondering scorn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be quiet, {{it will be}} all right,' {{said the}} fox; and taking a bigger basket than before, he filled it quite full of pears. Then he picked <b>it</b> up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and trotted off to the palace.|$|R
50|$|On 1872 while patrolling in Central Arizona, Bendire {{reportedly}} snatched a zone-tailed hawk's egg from a nest for {{his collection}} while {{under fire from}} an Apache scout and secured <b>it</b> safely <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> until he could return to camp.|$|R
500|$|The game {{introduces}} Yoshi, {{a dinosaur}} companion whom Mario can ride {{and who is}} able to eat most enemies. If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell, he will hold <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{for a period of time}} before swallowing it; Yoshi can also spit out the shell and fire it at enemies. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its own colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kills nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also contains hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding enemies to it until it matures.|$|E
2500|$|Tevez {{is known}} for his tango flare goal {{celebrations}} ever since playing for Boca Juniors, as well with Corinthians of Brazil. During his time at Manchester United, he would hide a baby's dummy in his shorts and put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> after scoring a goal as a commemorative gesture to his baby daughter. After his move to Manchester City, Tevez often performed a dance where he puts his hands together, bends down and rocks his body; this dance has been named after him as the [...] "Tevez Dance".|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} July 2008 over a Pharyngula blog entry written by Myers expressing amazement at news reports of death threats issued to University of Central Florida Student Senator Webster Cook. On June 29, 2008, Cook attended a Catholic Mass {{being held in}} the student union at UCF by a Catholic student group that receives funding from the student government. Cook received the Catholic Eucharist host but did not consume it immediately. He said later {{that he wanted to}} take it back to his seat to show a friend, but when stopped he pretended to put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> until back at his seat, then a church leader made forcible attempts to take the wafer from him. Cook stored the host at his home, then returned it one week later after receiving e-mail threats and pleas. Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League, described the student's actions as [...] "beyond hate speech" [...] and said that [...] "All options should be on the table, including expulsion." ...|$|E
5000|$|During a {{game against}} Wisconsin during the 2006-07, Matta's gum fell out of <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> when he was yelling at the refs. Despite the gum falling on the floor, Matta put <b>it</b> back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{continued}} chewing. This incident earned Matta the nickname [...] "Thad Gum".|$|R
50|$|Cyclamate was {{discovered}} in 1937 at the University of Illinois by graduate student Michael Sveda. Sveda {{was working in the}} lab on the synthesis of anti-fever medication. He put his cigarette down on the lab bench, and, when he put <b>it</b> back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> he discovered the sweet taste of cyclamate.|$|R
60|$|The dog {{caught the}} leaf as it fluttered to the ground, and {{carrying}} <b>it</b> carefully <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> deposited <b>it</b> {{at the feet}} of the little girls, seating himself before them with an air of deep interest. Bab and Betty picked it up and read <b>it</b> aloud <b>in</b> unison, while Ben leaned from his perch to listen and learn.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he slipped}} <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and, pulling the trigger, crashed heavily to the floor.|$|E
60|$|He {{picked up}} his cigar again and placing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> looked the {{personification}} of injured fatherhood.|$|E
60|$|At length, however, {{after he}} had got the end a little wetted, he drew it up and put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{it was a}} fine swim {{under the}} starshine. The air was warm as the water, and the water as warm as tepid milk. The good salt taste of <b>it</b> was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> the {{tingling}} of it along his limbs; and the steady beat of his heart, heavy and strong, made him glad for living.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: American {{musician}} Dom Flemons of the Carolina Chocolate Drops {{plays the}} quills, a traditional African-American pan flute, suspending <b>it</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> with a harmonica rack ...|$|R
50|$|On June 26, 1975, in a {{game against}} the Yankees, Carbo made a daring catch at the right-field wall at Fenway Park of a hit by Chris Chambliss, {{crashing}} into the wall and losing his chaw of tobacco, then asking the umpires for time so that he could search the outfield for the missing chaw; after holding up the game for nearly 10 minutes, he found it lying on the warning track and put <b>it</b> back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then, {{while the}} youth slumbered, {{unconscious}} of danger, the Sly Fox carefully drew {{the little red}} box from his pocket, and, taking <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> ran {{off into the woods}} with it.|$|E
60|$|So the boy {{opened his}} basket and broke a piece off the loaf of bread. He tossed {{it toward the}} Woozy, who cleverly caught <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and ate it in a twinkling.|$|E
60|$|The Professor {{knocked the}} ash from his cigar and {{replaced}} <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> His clasped hands rested {{in front of}} him. There was a twinkle of something almost like mirth in {{his eyes as he}} glanced up at the Inspector.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{was evidently}} made uncomfortable {{by what he}} {{supposed}} to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he didn't seem to enjoy. He turned <b>it</b> about <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> much longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill. He {{was about to take}} another bite, and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw that my bread and butter was gone.|$|R
5000|$|Open the victim's airway {{and leave}} the {{mouthpiece}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> If <b>it</b> is not <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> do not attempt to replace it. However ensure that it is switched to [...] "Surface" [...] position {{in the case of}} a rebreather, so that the loop does not flood. (Thalman makes no mention of opening the airway, possibly on the assumption that air will escape without this manoeuvre.) ...|$|R
50|$|Ogami and Daigorō keep on traveling, {{but they}} now come {{face-to-face}} with Lord Kurogawa's entire ninja force. Pushing Daigorō <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cart to safety, Ogami uses the spear blades in the cart's handrails to attack. All {{but two of}} the ninja are cut down, but Ogami is left wounded. He manages to push Daigorō to the safety of a deserted hut before collapsing from loss of blood. Daigorō goes in search of water for his father, finally bringing <b>it</b> back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> then takes some food offerings from a roadside shrine, leaving <b>his</b> jacket <b>in</b> honorable exchange.|$|R
60|$|Cynthia went to him, without embarrassment, and put {{her hand}} on his knee. Not once had he taken his eyes from her face. He put out his own hand with an awkward, shy movement, picked a {{strawberry}} from her fingers, and thrust <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|He fished {{from his}} pocket a cigar stump, self-evidently shot from the gutter, and {{prepared}} to put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to chew. Then he changed his mind, glared at his companions savagely, and unrolled his bundle. Appeared in his hand a druggist's bottle of alki.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] Emily remonstrated, [...] "need you ask?" [...] She {{glanced at}} Francine as she spoke, {{and then gave}} the dog his signal. He tossed up the sugar, and caught <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> His {{audience}} applauded him--and so, for that time, the skirmish ended.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{when they}} gave him his little loaf for breakfast, {{he thought he would}} like to eat <b>it</b> out <b>in</b> the garden; so he took <b>it</b> up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of {{a long way from the}} palace. But he was {{surprised}} to find that the brook was gone, and where it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and precious stones. Numbers of people splendidly dressed were going into it, and sounds of music and dancing and feasting could be heard from the windows.|$|R
50|$|Inhaling objects, enemies, {{and food}} is the {{trademark}} ability of Kirby's. To inhale anything, the player must {{hold down the}} B button. Kirby can then indefinitely inhale, and if an enemy, object, or food is in range, Kirby will eat it. When food is inhaled, it is automatically swallowed and will heal Kirby if he has any damage. When Kirby inhales an enemy or object, <b>it</b> remains <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> At this point, Kirby can shoot them out as a star (causing damage to anything in its path), or simply swallow them. When certain enemies are swallowed, Kirby will gain their ability, such as ice breath {{or the ability to}} turn into stone.|$|R
60|$|They made noises, and {{at first}} he was frightened at them. Then he {{perceived}} {{that they were very}} little, and he became bolder. They moved. He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. This was a source of enjoyment to him. He smelled it. He picked <b>it</b> up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>It</b> struggled and tickled his tongue. At the same time he was made aware of a sensation of hunger. His jaws closed together. There was a crunching of fragile bones, and warm blood ran <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> The taste of it was good. This was meat, the same as his mother gave him, only it was alive between his teeth and therefore better. So he ate the ptarmigan. Nor did he stop till he had devoured the whole brood. Then he licked <b>his</b> chops <b>in</b> quite the same way his mother did, and began to crawl out of the bush.|$|R
60|$|Thorny's only {{reply was}} {{to send his}} arrow {{straight}} up {{so far out of}} sight that it was a long while coming down again to stick quivering in the ground near by, whence Sancho brought <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> evidently highly approving of a game in which he could join.|$|E
60|$|He disgusted me much {{while with}} him, for when a horrid blowfly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly {{for a few}} moments between his finger and thumb, and before I knew {{what he was going to}} do, put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and ate it.|$|E
6000|$|The fox {{meanwhile}} {{was enjoying}} himself mightily. As {{soon as he}} had loosened the sledge, he had taken his favourite fish from among the piles neatly arranged for sale, and had trotted off to the forest with <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> By-and-by he met a bear, who stopped and said: 'Where {{did you find that}} fish, Mr. Fox?' ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{the hunger}} pangs {{were no longer}} so exquisite, he {{realized}} that he was weak. He was compelled to pause for frequent rests, when he attacked the muskeg berries and rush-grass patches. His tongue felt dry and large, as though covered with a fine hairy growth, and <b>it</b> tasted bitter <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>His</b> heart gave him a great deal of trouble. When he had travelled a few minutes it would begin a remorseless thump, thump, thump, and then leap up and away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go faint and dizzy.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a matter}} on which the Misses and Masters Merrifield were not wont to be particular; and {{with one of the}} teasing laughs that Bessie hated, Sam exclaimed as Susan turned to him, [...] "Yes, thank you, Sukey, I don't mind finger sauce," [...] but not before John was {{stretching}} out a hand glazed with sugar, and calling out, [...] "Oh, give it to me!" [...] and as <b>it</b> disappeared <b>in</b> <b>his</b> brother's <b>mouth,</b> he burst out angrily, [...] "How cross, Sam! You did that on purpose!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Mr. Cathro sat {{upon his}} hands {{as the best way}} of keeping them apart, but the moment Mr. Dishart's back {{presented}} itself, he winked at Mr. Ogilvy. He winked a good deal more presently. For after all--how to tell it! Tommy was ignominiously beaten, making such a beggarly show that the judges thought it unnecessary to take the essays home with them for leisurely consideration before pronouncing Mr. Lauchlan McLauchlan winner. There was quite a commotion in the school-room. At the end of the allotted time the two competitors had been told to hand in their essays, and how Mr. McLauchlan was sniggering is not worth recording, so dumfounded, confused, and raging was Tommy. He clung to his papers, crying fiercely that the two hours could not be up yet, and Lauchlan having tried to keep the laugh <b>in</b> too long <b>it</b> exploded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> whereupon, said he, with a guffaw, [...] "He hasna written a word for near an hour!" ...|$|R
