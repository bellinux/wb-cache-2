40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the potential of multi channel distribution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweets</b> industry and derive specific recommendations. The aim is to identify what are chances and risks, {{and how to make}} chances more probable while avoiding risks. An empirical study is carried out which utilizes the perspectives of customers and sales persons as well (triangulation). The main results are that the benefits of multi channel marketing do not materialize for customers for low valued sweets, but that multi channel marketing is valuable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweets</b> industry only for highly valued products, like precious pralines. Here multi channel marketing may generate new customers, or it may contribute to sales in existing channels. This kind of synergy may arise if channels do not compete but are closely interlinked. This is the most important chance since this kind of synergy adds to the convenience of customers (thereby raising sales) and reduces the risks of channel conflicts, cannibalization, and conflicts with retailers...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this {{would be the end of}} his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E

The International Potato Center in Lima, Peru is looking for genes to target <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally.

Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn rootworm, a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth, killing them within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1995–96 NCAA season, Wake Forest {{had to deal}} with the loss of Childress, who graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. This provided an opportunity for Duncan to show his leadership qualities, and his inexperienced team lost only four games in the entire ACC season. The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted ACC Defensive Player of the Year and won his first ACC Player of the Year award. At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the 1996 NBA draft, but in the end, he stayed in college.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that coppicing has been continuously practised since pre-history. Coppiced stems are characteristically curved at the base.

The curve may allow the identification of coppice timber in archaeological sites. Timber <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Track in Somerset (built in the winter of 3807 and 3806 BC) has been identified as coppiced lime.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in 2015 by scientists from Ghent University and the International Potato Center found that the genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from Agrobacterium, with genes being actively expressed by the plants.

Transgenes were observed both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> potato's closely related wild relatives, and also were found in more distantly related wild species. This observation makes cultivated sweet potatoes the first known example of a naturally transgenic food crop.|$|E
