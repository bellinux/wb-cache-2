50|$|Vitruvius, {{through his}} text On Architecture, is an {{important}} ancient source about this building type and provides many details about what he calls “palaestra, Greek-style”. Although the specifics of his descriptions do not always correspond to the architectural evidence, probably because he was writing around 27 BC, his account provides insight into the general design and uses {{of this type of}} space. As Vitruvius describes, the palaestra was square or rectangular in shape with colonnades along all four sides creating porticoes. The portico on the northern side of the palaestra was of <b>double</b> <b>depth</b> to protect against the weather. Big halls (exedrae) were built along the single depth sides of the palaestra with seats for those enjoying intellectual pursuits, and the <b>double</b> <b>depth</b> side was divided into an area for youth activities (ephebeum), a punching bag area (coryceum), a room for applying powders (conisterium), a room for cold bathing, and an oil storeroom (elaeothesium).|$|R
50|$|As delivered, {{they were}} {{equipped}} with <b>depth</b> charge <b>racks</b> and Mk6 K-Gun’s aft; and a Mk10 Hedgehog forward. These were removed during the Iran-Iraq War. A ZU-23 anti-aircraft gun was added in 1982; {{this in turn}} was replaced by an Oerlikon 20 mm gun in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Staten Island had her {{designed}} heavy armament {{reduced to}} four single 3"50cal., eight single 40mm., and two <b>depth</b> charge <b>racks</b> for Soviet service.

50|$|The Temptress {{class were}} {{armed with a}} 4-inch gun forward, a 3 in/50 dual-purpose (DP) gun aft, two 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} guns, 2 <b>depth</b> charge <b>racks,</b> and 4 <b>depth</b> charge throwers. The Action class replaced the 4-inch gun with another 3-inch/50 cal. DP gun, and added a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar.|$|R
5000|$|The vessels were {{designed}} as fast attack crafts, but designated [...] "missile boats" [...] in the Finnish Navy, as {{to tone down}} their offensive capabilities.

50|$|In 1916, all {{had their}} single torpedo tubes {{replaced}} by twin mounts (with no reloads) while one 3-inch gun was removed.

5000|$|Following World War II most of {{the class}} had their AA and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{armament}} upgraded. The 40 mm and 20 mm guns were replaced by 2-6 3 in/50 caliber guns in up to two twin and one single mounting. One <b>depth</b> charge <b>rack</b> was removed and two Hedgehog ASW mortar mounts added. The K-guns were retained. Nine additional (for a total of 35) ships were converted to radar picket destroyers (DDR) in the early 1950s; these typically received only one 3-inch/50 caliber twin mount to save weight for radar equipment, as did the wartime radar pickets. Nine ships were converted to escort destroyers (DDE), emphasizing ASW. [...] was the most thorough DDE conversion, with 4 3-inch/70 caliber guns in twin enclosed mounts, two Weapon Alpha launchers, four new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 ASW torpedo, and one <b>depth</b> charge <b>rack.</b>|$|R

50|$|During World War I {{the class}} was {{equipped}} {{with one or two}} <b>depth</b> charge <b>racks</b> for the convoy escort mission.
