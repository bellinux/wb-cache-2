25|$|Already in {{the late}} Middle Ages, some {{distinction}} had been occasionally made between on one hand 'rälssi', tax exemption; {{and on the other}} hand a proper ennoblement. It was part of the custom that only kings were entitled to dub knights and ennoble, while in addition several other authorities, including at least important castellans of big castle fiefs, were able to grant tax exemption ('rälssi') to landholdings and useful local gentrymen. Only the increasing precision (and greed for tax revenues) of the Vasa kings brought <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> differences afront in 16th century and particularly then in 17th century when the House of Knoghts and Nobility had been established.|$|E
25|$|Influenced heavily by Karl Barth's theology, Hegel's {{philosophy}} of history, and Ernst Bloch's {{philosophy of}} hope, Moltmann developed his own form of liberation theology {{predicated on the}} view that God suffers with humanity, while also promising humanity a better future through {{the hope of the}} Resurrection, which he has labelled a 'theology of hope'. Much of Moltmann's work has been to develop the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ideas for various areas of theology. While much of Moltmann's early work was critiqued by some as being non-Trinitarian, during the latter stages of his career Moltmann has become known for developing a form of social trinitarianism. His two most famous works are Theology of Hope and The Crucified God. Moltmann also served as a mentor to Miroslav Volf.|$|E
500|$|The <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{subsequent}} rulings mandated two new rules, one {{narrow and}} one broad. First, restrictions may {{be imposed on}} LSC {{so long as they}} do not discriminate on the basis of [...] "viewpoint" [...] or [...] "opinion". Because the other restrictions were not based on viewpoint, they were upheld. Second, on a broader scale the government may not discriminate against viewpoints in any instance where it is funding a private entity to promote a diversity of views. For this reason, the decision in Velazquez set an important precedent for how the government may act as subsidizer and speaker.|$|E
50|$|Another folk tale {{concerns}} the vagina dentata ("toothed vagina"). The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tales is that sexual intercourse {{might result in}} injury, emasculation, or castration for the man involved.

500|$|Reticulated and Masai giraffes {{have the}} highest mtDNA diversity, which is {{consistent}} with giraffes originating in eastern Africa. Populations further north are more closely related to the former, while those to the south are more related to the latter. Giraffes appear to select mates of the same coat type, which are imprinted on them as calves. The <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> findings for the conservation of giraffes were summarised by David Brown, lead author of the study, who told BBC News: [...] "Lumping all giraffes into one species obscures the reality that some kinds of giraffe are on the brink. Some of these populations number only a few hundred individuals and need immediate protection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tolkien {{intended}} the name Gondor {{to represent a}} sample of Sindarin, an Elven language devised by him, and within the books used by the Dúnedain for nomenclature. The word means [...] "land of stone", and is echoed {{in the text of}} The Lord of the Rings by the name for Gondor among the Rohirrim, Stoningland. The <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> names were not explained by the author, although his early writings suggest that this was a reference to the highly developed masonry of Gondorians in contrast to their rustic neighbours'. This view is supported by the Drúedain terms for Gondorians and Minas Tirith—Stonehouse-folk and Stone-city.|$|E

2500|$|Homosexual and {{bisexual}} behaviors {{occur in a}} number of other animal species. Such behaviors include sexual activity, courtship, affection, pair bonding, and parenting, and are widespread; a 1999 review by researcher Bruce Bagemihl shows that homosexual behavior has been documented in about 500 species, ranging from primates to gut worms. Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same species. The motivations for and <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> behaviors have yet to be fully understood, since most species have yet to be fully studied. According to Bagemihl, [...] "the animal kingdom [...] it with much greater sexual diversity—including homosexual, bisexual and nonreproductive sex—than the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> last conjectures are considerable. When a {{group of}} workers becomes {{conscious}} of some connection to all other workers, such realization may animate a desire not just for better wages, hours, and working conditions, but rather, {{to change the system}} that limits or withholds such benefits. Paul Frederick Brissenden acknowledged as much in his 1919 publication The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism. Brissenden described revolutionary industrial unionism as industrial unionism [...] "animated and guided by the revolutionary (socialist or anarchist) spirit..." [...] Brissenden wrote that both industrial unionism and revolutionary industrial unionism [...] "hark back in their essential principles to [...] dramatic revolutionary period in English unionism..." [...] of roughly the late 1820s, the 1830s and the 1840s. He traced both the industrial and the revolutionary impulses through various union movements ever since.|$|E

SmithII of Kronos Advisory, LLC produced a report on Iran’s ties to Al-Qaeda that was distributed to members of the Congressional Anti-Terrorism Caucus. Titled [...] "The al-Qa'ida-Qods Force Nexus: Scratching the Surface of a Known Unknown", a redacted version of Smith's report is available online via the blog site owned by American military geostrategist and [...] author Thomas P.M. Barnett. The report's Issue Summary section explains: [...] "This report focuses on the history of Iran's relationship with al-Qa'ida, and briefly addresses potential <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ties.

2500|$|Many of the {{strategies}} in negotiation vary across genders, and this leads to variations in outcomes for different genders, often with women experiencing less success in negotiations as a consequence. [...] This {{is due to a}} number of factors, including that {{it has been shown that}} it is more difficult for women to be self-advocating when they are negotiating. [...] Many of the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men. [...] Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants. [...] The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine. [...] Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating.|$|E
