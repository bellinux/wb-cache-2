5000|$|Issa Rae was {{inspired}} to create The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl in January 2009 while working at New Federal Theatre in New York City. Experiencing difficulty in meeting people in an unfamiliar place, Issa Rae decided {{that it would be}} entertaining to depict uncomfortable scenarios one may experience when dealing with others. [...] Neglecting the idea for 2 years, Issa Rae's interest was renewed after reading an article by Leslie Pitterson pointing out the absence of black female nerd characters on screen. She then called on friends to shoot the first episode. The series went viral through word of mouth, blog posts and social media, which resulted in further media coverage. In an effort to fund the rest of the season, Issa Rae and producer Tracy Oliver [...] decided {{to raise money for the}} series through Kickstarter. On August 11, 2011 they were awarded $56,269 from 1,960 donations. Due to the popularity of the series, Issa Rae has been interviewed by <b>Fredricka</b> <b>Whitfield</b> for CNN Newsroom, Michel Martin for Tell Me More, Associated Press and other media outlets.|$|E
