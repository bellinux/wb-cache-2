5|$|LeMond is a {{longtime}} vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning {{of his relationship with}} Dr. Michele Ferrari.

5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> authenticity of the work.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques date {{an object of}} popular interest, for example the Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistency}} of beetle morphology, in particular their possession of elytra, has long suggested that Coleoptera is monophyletic, though {{there have been}} <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> arrangement of the suborders, namely the Adephaga, Archostemata, Myxophaga and Polyphaga within that clade. The twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera, {{are thought to be}} a sister group to the beetles, having split from them in the Early Permian.|$|E

5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was not one of}} the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by Philip H.

5|$|Though {{there are}} <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{authenticity}} of the White Horse Prophecy as a whole, several sources attribute to Smith {{the idea that the}} United States Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings with regard to the Constitution.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{requirement}} {{is that the}} celebrant intends to perform baptism.

5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a {{defamatory}} {{depiction of}} a character that referenced a specific politician, the current Minister for Government Revitalisation Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in the}} cancellation of its rerun on AT-X.

5|$|In 1838 Planché was to {{collaborate}} on an opera with another notable composer, Felix Mendelssohn.

But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> subject, asked Planché to start work on a completely new libretto, and eventually stopped replying to Planché's letters.

5|$|Only {{a single}} known {{case of fraud}} {{involving}} a record submitted to BBRC has become public. In autumn 1994, Nigel Pepper, a birdwatcher from Essex, claimed to have recorded a hermit thrush in a garden in Chipping Ongar. <b>Doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> record were raised in Birdwatch and BBRC reviewed the record in 2002, but decided that it should stand. In 2009, Pepper revealed in Birdwatch magazine (Birdwatch 204: 46-47) that the record was a deception, made in protest at perceived secrecy surrounding rare birds in the county.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{appears to}} have arrived in Fiji in 1925 on Ono-i-lau and Vatoa islands.

Its spread in Fiji has been limited, and there are <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> population's viability. Tonga was colonised {{at about the same}} date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group.|$|E
