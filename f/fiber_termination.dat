Where FTTP is available, they have offered a triple play service on a 10/10 Mbit/s Internet connection since 2010. Fastweb started offering FTTP customers the option to upgrade to 100/50 Mbit/s at a small additional fee. Telecom Italia announced, in March 2008, they would deploy FTTH in 140,000 homes in Milan, by the end of 2008 and in 10 cities the following year at speeds up to 1 Gbit/s. As of November 2015 the state-of-the-art internet connection is represented by Vodafone fibre, the availability of which is limited to some areas of Milan and Bologna, reaching speeds of 1 Gbit/s in download and 200 Mbit/s in upload. This is a FTTH, just like the 100/50 connections provided by Fastweb in a bunch of cities. Most of other connections advertised as fibre are actually FTTC / VDSL (Telecom Italia is currently offering 30/3 and 50/10 connections, whereas Fastweb goes up to 200/20 and Vodafone reaches 100/20). As it might be expected, the real speed is about 20% less than the advertised speed in the case of FTTC.Fiber for Italy initiative: The initiative has the stated goal of offering 100 Mbit/s symmetrical connections to 10 million Italian subscribers across 15 cities by 2018 and up to 1Gbit/s for business customers. It involves operators Wind, Tele2, Vodafone, and Fastweb. An ongoing pilot project in the Italian capital Rome delivers symmetrical speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s to small businesses. Telecom Italia (the largest Italian operator) is not a participant in the Fiber for Italy program, but has independently committed to provide ultra-highspeed broadband up to 100 Mbit/s symmetrical connections to 50 percent of the country's population (138 cities) by 2018.

Solidification has also been performed with mechanical stirring and while using a magnetic field to reduce convection. Most experiments were performed on the MnBi-Bi eutectic. The rod spacing depended on the growth conditions, with several contradictions between results of different investigators. Proposed mechanisms are discussed and their predictions compared with the experimental results. Vigorous mechanical stirring appears to coarsen the microstructure by altering the concentration field in front of the freezing interface.

In the present study, further evaluation of these changes was performed in male Brown-Norway (BN/BiRij) rats.

Although VP plasma levels of young and old rats did not differ significantly and no change in either urine or plasma osmolality was observed, urinary VP concentration and 24 -hour urinary VP excretion were significantly increased in senescent rats. The activation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) in the senescent rat seems thus to compensate for a decreased responsiveness to VP in the aged kidney.

Prior experimental results on the influence of microgravity on the microstructure of fibrous eutectics have been contradictory. Theoretical work at Clarkson University showed that buoyancy-driven convection in the vertical Bridgman configuration is not vigorous enough to alter the concentration field in the melt sufficiently to cause a measurable change in microstructure when the eutectic grows at minimum supercooling. Currently, there are four other hypotheses that might explain the observed changes in microstructure of fibrous eutectics caused by convection: (1) Disturbance of the concentration boundary layer arising from an off-eutectic melt composition and growth at the extremum; (2) Disturbance of the concentration boundary layer of a habit-modifying impurity; (3) Disturbance of the concentration boundary layer arising from an off-eutectic interfacial composition due to non-extremum growth; and (4) A fluctuating freezing rate combined with differences in the kinetics of <b>fiber</b> <b>termination</b> and fiber formation. We favor the last of these hypotheses.

Some, but not all, synaptic inputs of both types of neurons were found to arise from the mossy fiber system. The axons of spiny neurons in the stratum lucidum were heavily collateralized, terminating primarily in the stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum of CA 3, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the stratum pyramidale and stratum oriens. Only a few axonal projections were found that extended beyond the CA 3 region into CA 1 and the hilus. Aspiny neurons fell into two classes: those projecting axons to the stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum of CA 3 and those with axon terminations mainly in the stratum pyramidale and stratum oriens.

40|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{for this research}} {{was to determine the}} cause for space processing altering the microstructure of some eutectics, especially the MnBi-Bi eutectic. Four primary hypotheses were to be tested under this current grant: (1) A fibrous microstructure is much more sensitive to convection than a lamellar microstructure, which was assumed in our prior theoretical treatment. (2) An interface with one phase projecting out into the melt is much more sensitive to convection than a planar interface, which was assumed in our prior theoretical treatment. (3) The Soret effect is much more important in the absence of convection and has a sufficiently large influence on microstructure that its action can explain the flight results. (4) The microstructure is much more sensitive to convection when the composition of the bulk melt is off eutectic. These hypotheses were tested. It was concluded that none of these can explain the Grumman flight results. Experiments also were performed on the influence of current pulses on MnBi-Bi microstructure. A thorough review was made of all experimental results on the influence of convection on the fiber spacing in rod eutectics, including results from solidification in space or at high gravity, and use of mechanical stirring or a magnetic field. Contradictory results were noted. The predictions of models for convective influences were compared with the experimental results. Vigorous mechanical stirring appears to coarsen the microstructure by altering the concentration field in front of the freezing interface.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the limitations and errors induced by modeling a composite layer composed of straight carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy matrix as an homogenous layer with Cauchy effective moduli is performed. Specifically, the material system studied has IM 7 carbon fibers arranged in a square array and bonded together with 8552 epoxy resin (IM 7 / 8552). The finite element method is used to study the effect of free surfaces on the local elastic fields in 0 Â°, 45 Â° and 90 Â° laminae, in which as many as 256 individual fibers are modeled. Through these analyses, it is shown that a micro-boundary layer, analogous to the macro-boundary layer observed in composite laminates, is developed at the microlevel. Additionally, [0 / 90]s and [90 / 0]s laminates are studied to investigate the joint action of the macro- and micro-boundary layers. Unless otherwise noted, fiber volume fractions of VÆ’= 0. 20 and VÆ’= 0. 65 are selected and the domains are subjected to uniform axial extension. Although this study is done for a highly idealized geometry (i. e. with a single material system and under a simple loading condition) the principles of periodicity, symmetry and antisymmetry used to efficiently perform a direct numerical simulation {{with a large number}} of fiber inclusions is general, and can be applied to more complicated geometries and boundary conditions. The purpose of the current work is to be {{the first step in a}} building block approach to understanding the interaction of multiple scales in fiber-reinforced composites through direct numerical simulations. ^ The main part of the current manuscript focuses on the characterization of a micro-boundary layer that develops in fiber reinforced composite layers. This phenomena results from the changing constraints on the constituent phases as a result of discontinuities, such as free surfaces or ply interfaces. The effect is most pronounced in laminae that have a <b>fiber</b> <b>termination</b> intersecting a free surface, and appears to be maximized in a 90 Â° lamina. In an individual lamina, under uniform extension, the micro-boundary layer emanating from a free surface intersected by a <b>fiber</b> <b>termination</b> is analogous to the macro-boundary layer described by Pipes and Pagano. ^ One consequence of the micro-boundary layer is a variation of apparent moduli in this region. The use of homogeneous effective moduli, whether they are based on Cauchy elasticity, micropolar elasticity, or some other higher order theory, cannot capture the effect in composite laminae. Methods based on the use of modified effective modulus theory (e. g. GOALS or Voroni cell finite elements) are capable of capturing this effect. This is because these types of methods place a realistic representation of the microstructure in critical locations. Accuracy results when correct microstructure overlaps correct boundary conditions. ^ The methods used to perform direct numerical simulations on individual laminae are extended to cross-ply laminates (i. e. [0 / 90]s and [90 / 0]s). In this final study of the current manuscript, many interesting results are observed because of the joint action of the micro- and macro-boundary layers. First, more error is observed in the 0 Â° plies than in the individual 0 Â° laminae under uniform extension. This result is expected because of the differences in loading applied to the layers in the different configurations. In agreement with other studies, the largest amount of error in a 0 Â° ply is observed at the free-surface ply interface with a 90 Â° ply. In addition, a stacking sequence effect is observed in the 0 Â° plies. ^ Compared to the individual laminae results, there is an increased error in the effective modulus stiffness observed in the interior of the individual plies of the cross-ply laminates. However, the largest errors in the entire laminate are observed at the free surface intersected by fiber terminations in the 90 Â° plies. Rather unexpectedly, the overall maximum error in the 90 Â° plies is removed from the interface with the 0 Â° plies for both stacking sequences. For the current laminate and loading configuration, the errors in the 90 Â° plies are bounded by the errors observed in the individual 90 Â° laminae under uniform extension. This result indicates that for fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix composites, it might be possible to estimate the overall maximum error in a multiscale analysis from a relatively simple direct numerical simulation of a 90 Â° layer.

40|$|This grant {{began in}} June of 1996. Its long term {{goal is to}} be able to control the {{microstructure}} of directionally solidified eutectic alloys, through an improved understanding of the influence of convection. The primary objective of the projects in the present grant is to test hypotheses for the reported influence of microgravity on the microstructure of eutectics. The prior experimental results on the influence of microgravity on the microstructure of eutectics have been contradictory. With lamellar eutectics, microgravity had a negligible effect on the microstructure. Microgravity experiments with fibrous eutectics sometimes showed a finer microstructure and sometimes a coarser microstructure. Most research has been done on the MnBi/Bi rod-like eutectic. Larson and Pirich obtained a two-fold finer microstructure both from microgravity and by use of a magnetic field to quench buoyancy-driven convection. Smith, on the other hand, observed no change in microgravity. Prior theoretical work at Clarkson University showed that buoyancy-driven convection in the vertical Bridgman configuration is not vigorous enough to alter the concentration field in front of a growing eutectic sufficiently to cause a measurable change in microstructure. We assumed that the bulk melt was at the eutectic composition and that freezing occurred at the extremum, i. e. with minimum total undercooling at the freezing interface. There have been four hypotheses attempting to explain the observed changes in microstructure of fibrous eutectics caused by convection: I. A fluctuating freezing rate, combined with unequal kinetics for <b>fiber</b> <b>termination</b> and branching. 2. Off-eutectic composition, either in the bulk melt due to an off-eutectic feed or at the freezing interface because of departure from the extremum condition. 3. Presence of a strong habit modifying impurity whose concentration at the freezing interface would be altered by convection. At the beginning of the present grant, we favored the first of these hypotheses and set out to test it both experimentally and theoretically. We planned the following approaches: I. Pass electric current pulses through the MnBi/Bi eutectic during directional solidification in order to produce an oscillatory freezing rate. 2. Directionally solidify the MnBi/Bi eutectic on Mir using the QUELD II gradient freeze furnace developed by Professor Smith at Queen's University. 3. Select another fibrous eutectic system for investigation using the Accelerated Crucible Rotation Technique to introduce convection. 4. Develop theoretical models for eutectic solidification with an oscillatory freezing rate. Because of the problems with Mir, we substituted ground-based experiments at Queen's University with QUELD II vertical and horizontal, with and without vibration of the furnace. The Al-Si system was chosen for the ACRT experiments. Three related approaches were used to model eutectic solidification with an oscillatory freezing rate.

The dentate gyrus, on the other hand, has only few projections to the CA 1 and the subiculum, and none have clearly been shown to extrahippocampal target regions. Results Using anterograde and retrograde tracer techniques in the Madagascan lesser hedgehog tenrec (Afrosoricidae, Afrotheria) it was shown in this study that the dentate hilar region gave rise to a faint, but distinct, bilateral projection to the most rostromedial portion of the olfactory tubercle, particularly its molecular layer. Unlike the CA 1 and the subiculum the dentate gyrus did not project to the accumbens nucleus. A control injection into the medial septum-diagonal band complex also retrogradely labeled cells in the dentate hilus, but these neurons were found immediately adjacent to the heavily labeled CA 3, while the tracer injections into the rostromedial tubercle did not reveal any labeling in CA 3.

Following fixation in paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and picric acid, excellent staining was obtained with two different TRH antisera. Many TRH-containing neurons were present in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), especially in the dorsocaudal part of this nucleus. They were mostly parvicellular, but a few magnocellular TRH-positive neurons were observed as well. The PVN also contained a dense network of TRH fibers. The supraoptic nucleus (SON) did not show any TRH immunoreactivity, excluding the possibility of cross-reactivity of the antiserum with neurohypophysial hormones or their precursors. In addition, TRH cells were found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the circadian clock of the brain, in the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) and dorsomedially of the SON. We observed small number of TRH cells throughout the hypothalamic gray in all subjects studied. A high density of TRH-containing fibers was seen not only in the median eminence but also in other hypothalamic areas, e. g., in the ventromedial nucleus (VM) and in the perifornical area. The results generally agree with earlier data in the rat, with the exception of the absence of TRH cells in the SON. The large number of sites of TRH-containing <b>fiber</b> <b>terminations</b> on neurons suggests important physiological functions of this neuropeptide as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the human brain, in addition to its role as a neurohormone in pituitary secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether a differential distribution of vestibular afferent information to central nuclear neurons is present in pigeons was studied using neural tracer compounds. Discrete tracing of afferent fibers innervating the individual semicircular canal and otolith organs was produced by sectioning individual branches of the vestibular nerve that innervate the different receptor organs and applying crystals of horseradish peroxidase, or a horseradish peroxidase/cholera toxin mixture, or a biocytin compound for neuronal uptake and transport. Afferent fibers and their terminal distributions within the brainstem and cerebellum were visualized subsequently. Discrete areas in the pigeon central nervous system that receive primary vestibular input include the superior, dorsal lateral, ventral lateral, medial, descending, and tangential vestibular nuclei; the A and B groups; the intermediate, medial, and lateral cerebellar nuclei; and the nodulus, the uvula, and the paraflocculus. Generally, the vertical canal afferents projected heavily to medial regions in the superior and descending vestibular nuclei as well as the A group. Vertical canal projections to the medial and lateral vestibular nuclei were observed but were less prominent. Horizontal canal projections to the superior and descending vestibular nuclei were much more centrally located than those of the vertical canals. A more substantial projection to the medial and lateral vestibular nuclei was seen with horizontal canal afferents compared to vertical canal fibers. Afferents innervating the utricle and saccule terminated generally in the lateral regions of all vestibular nuclei in areas that were separate from the projections of the semicircular canals. In addition, utricular fibers projected to regions in the vestibular nuclei that overlapped with the horizontal semicircular canal terminal fields, whereas saccular afferents projected to regions that received vertical canal <b>fiber</b> <b>terminations.</b> Lagenar afferents projected throughout the cochlear nuclei, to the dorsolateral regions of the cerebellar nuclei, and to lateral regions of the superior, lateral, medial, and descending vestibular nuclei...|$|R

40|$|High power pulsed lasers are {{commonly}} deployed in harsh environments, like space flight and military missions, {{for a variety}} of systems such as LIDAR, optical communications over long distances, or optical firing of explosives. Fiber coupling of the laser pulse from the laser to where it is needed can often save size, reduce weight, and lead to a more robust and reliable system. Typical <b>fiber</b> optic <b>termination</b> procedures are not sufficient for injection of these high power laser pulses without catastrophic damage to the fiber endface. In the current study, we will review the causes of fiber damage during high power injection and discuss methods used to avoid these issues to permit fiber use with high reliability in these applications. A brief review of the design considerations for high peak power laser pulse injection will be presented to familiarize the audience with all the areas that need to be considered during the design phase. The majority of this paper focuses on the proper fiber polishing methods for high power use with an emphasis on laser polishing of the fibers.

40|$|Lasers {{with high}} peak power pulses are {{commonly}} used in spaceflight missions {{for a wide range}} of applications, from LIDAR systems to optical communications. Due to the high optical power needed, the laser has to be located on the exterior of the satellite or coupled through a series of free space optics. This presents challenges for thermal management, radiation resistance, and mechanical design. Future applications will require multiple lasers located close together, which further complicates the design. Coupling the laser energy into a fiber optic cable allows the laser to be relocated to a more favorable position on the spacecraft. Typical <b>fiber</b> optic <b>termination</b> procedures are not sufficient for injection of these high-power laser pulses without catastrophic damage to the fiber endface. In the current study, we will review the causes of fiber damage during high-power injection and discuss our new manufacturing procedures that overcome these issues to permit fiber use with high reliability in these applications. We will also discuss the proper methods for launching the laser pulses into the fiber to avoid damage and how this is being implemented for current spaceflight missions. I...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} and tested a custom-made magnetic-imaging-compatible visual projection {{system designed to}} project on a very wide visual field (~ 80 Â°). A standard projector was modified with a coupling lens, projecting images into the termination of an image <b>fiber.</b> The other <b>termination</b> of the <b>fiber</b> {{was placed in the}} 3 -T scanner room with a projection lens, which projected the images relayed by the fiber onto a screen over the head coil, viewed by a participant wearing magnifying goggles. To validate the system, wide-field stimuli were presented in order to identify retinotopic visual areas. The results showed that this low-cost and versatile optical system may be a valuable tool to map visual areas in the brain that process peripheral receptive fields...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the timing advantage of implementing a multiple-fan-beam projection technique using optical fiber sensors for a tomography system. To prepare the sensors {{to be used}} for this projection, a collimator is not needed, but optical <b>fiber</b> lens <b>termination</b> is crucial. In this research, the fiber optic lens for transmitters is modeled by experimental methods to transmit light at an emission angle of 30 deg. Due to this small emission angle, a multiprojection technique can be implemented without the light overlapping. A multiple-fan-beam projection technique is here defined as one allowing more than one emitter to project light at the same time using the switch-mode fan-beam method. This method can increase the optical sensor's ability for flow visualization. For the 32 pairs of sensors used, the two-projection technique and four-projection technique were investigated. Sixteen sets of projections formed one frame of light emission for the two-projection technique, and eight sets did so for the four-projection technique. Compared to the conventional single-light projection used in the switch-mode fan-beam method, multiple-light projection can achieve a higher data acquisition rate, thus minimizing data loss and producing a more accurate real-time tomographic image. For four projections the data acquisition rate is 609. 76 frames/s...|$|R
40|$|The Atomic Spectroscopy and Collisions Using Slow Antiprotons (ASACUSA) {{experiment}} at the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) facility of CERN constructed segmented scintillators {{to detect}} and track the charged pions which emerge from antiproton annihilations in a future superconducting radiofrequency Paul trap for antiprotons. A system of 541 cast and extruded scintillator bars were arranged in 11 detector modules which provided a spatial resolution of 17 mm. Green wavelength-shifting fibers were embedded in the scintillators, and read out by silicon photomultipliers which had a sensitive area of 1 x 1 mm^ 2. The photoelectron yields of various scintillator configurations were measured using a negative pion beam of momentum p ~ 1 GeV/c. Various fibers and silicon photomultipliers, <b>fiber</b> end <b>terminations,</b> and couplings between the fibers and scintillators were compared. The detectors were also tested using the antiproton beam of the AD. Nonlinear effects due to the saturation of the silicon photomultiplier were seen at high annihilation rates of the antiprotons.

40|$|An {{improved}} packaging {{approach has}} been devised for filling a hollow-core photonic-crystal fiber (HC-PCF) with a gas, sealing the HC-PCF to retain the gas, and providing for optical connections and, optionally, a plumbing fitting for changing or augmenting the gas filling. Gas-filled HC-PCFs can be many meters long and {{have been found to}} be attractive as relatively compact, lightweight, rugged alternatives to conventional gas-filled glass cells for use as molecular-resonance frequency references for stabilization of lasers in some optical-metrology, lidar, optical-communication, and other advanced applications. Prior approaches to gas filling and sealing of HC-PCFs have involved, variously, omission of any attempt to connectorize the PCF, connectorization inside a vacuum chamber (an awkward and expensive process), or temporary exposure of one end of an HC-PCF to the atmosphere, potentially resulting in contamination of the gas filling. Prior approaches have also involved, variously, fusion splicing of HC-PCFs with other optical <b>fibers</b> or other <b>termination</b> techniques that give rise to Fresnel reflections of about 4 percent, which results in output intensity noise...|$|R
