5|$|The {{theory that}} Custer's {{soldiers}} committed suicide en masse {{toward the end}} of the Battle of the Little Bighorn has been controversial from the moment it was first suggested, and the discussion continues. The notion was so controversial that Marquis could not find a publisher for Keep the Last Bullet <b>for</b> <b>Yourself,</b> his main vehicle for promoting the theory, and the book did not appear in print until 1976, forty years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Zones. The {{object of}} this mode is to capture various control {{points on the}} map. Each control point has 3 levels for each team, and a neutral level. A player can do this in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> but in Zones, their team gains points {{for the number of}} zones the player has, and how many levels each one has. The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by their team. The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all control points.|$|E
5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet <b>for</b> <b>Yourself.</b>|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet <b>for</b> <b>Yourself,</b> considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E

25|$|After touring {{for nearly}} two years {{straight}} for her album Speak <b>for</b> <b>Yourself,</b> Heap continued her travels, this time with only a laptop and video camera on hand, as she began her writing trip for her next album. Nine weeks later she returned to the UK with the beginnings of the award-winning Ellipse and footage (as requested by a fan to film the making of the album) from its quiet beginning. Back in Essex, Heap hired Justine Pearsall to document the creation of the album. The film documents the creation of the album and the renovation of Heap’s childhood home, including turning her old playroom into her new home studio. Everything In-Between: The Story of Ellipse was released in November 2010.|$|E

25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence.

What you make for others is first of all what you make <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{statements}} in the Mishnah and Gemara, chavrusa learning was a key feature of yeshivas in the eras of the Tannaim (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE) and Amoraim (Rabbis of the Talmudic period, 200 to 500 CE). The Rabbis repeatedly urged their students to acquire a study partner; for example, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachya enjoined students to [...] "Make <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> a Rav and acquire <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> a chaver", and Rabbi Yose ben Chalafta told his son Rabbi Abba that he was ignorant {{because he did not}} study with someone else. The choice of chavrusas seems to have been based on friendship or social proximity; thus, chavrusas fulfilled a social as well as an educational need.|$|E
