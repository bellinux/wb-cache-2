30|$|If {{negative}} {{data and}} <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> reproduce <b>published</b> work remain unshared, it essentially means that very valuable {{information for the}} field is withheld, potentially resulting in duplication of efforts, from which ethical questions arise, since in principle it contradicts {{one of the goals}} of the 3 R’s (i.e., reduction) in animal research. Moreover, preclinical efficacy data are increasingly considered unreliable and being of low quality, especially behavioural data which, in many cases mistakenly, are considered nice-to-have rather than obligatory. Given the already very complex nature of neuroscientific research, with high demand for more effective therapies, coupled to low success rates to develop such therapies and high development costs (Frantz 2004; Kola and Landis 2004), there is disappointment in the lack of predictability and reliability of those data. As such there is an unwillingness to invest further in these areas and it may be speculated that this situation contributed, at least in part, to decisions of major pharmaceutical companies to exit the neuroscience field.|$|R

The deficits noted were that the authors included patients in the Seprafilm group that were treated with a different adhesion product, the 4, 203 patients included represented an extremely diverse population of patients and surgical procedures, the data on effectiveness in reducing SBO included adverse event reporting and a definition of SBO which included paralytic ileus, and a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> include <b>published</b> reports on the appropriate use of Seprafilm [11 – 13].
