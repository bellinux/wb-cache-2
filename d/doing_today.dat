2500|$|... rom my {{knowledge}} of the IDF and from {{the extent to which}} I have been following the current operation, I don’t think there has ever been a {{time in the history of}} warfare when any army has made more efforts to reduce civilian casualties and deaths of innocent people than the IDF is <b>doing</b> <b>today</b> in Gaza... Hamas, the enemy they have been fighting, has been trained extensively by Iran and by Hezbollah, to fight among the people, to use the civilian population in Gaza as a human shield... Hamas factor in the uses of the population as a major part of their defensive plan. So even though as I say, Israel, the IDF, has taken enormous steps...to reduce civilian casualties, it is impossible, it is impossible to stop that happening when the enemy has been using civilians as human shields.|$|E

5000|$|... 2001 and 2002 saw {{the band}} touring {{in the wake}} of What Are Rockstars <b>Doing</b> <b>Today.</b> They {{launched}} their Love Ya & Leave Ya Tour - the largest the group had done up until that point - which saw them on their first trip to New Zealand. The City Trash Tour with The Nation Blue and Girls Against Boys followed in June-July 2002. They started recording demos for a fourth album early in the year - tracks such as [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "Sarah May" [...] from these sessions were later released as B-sides. Later that year, the band made its second trip to the UK, where What Are Rockstars <b>Doing</b> <b>Today</b> had been released on Cargo Records. In 2002, Magic Dirt appeared on the [...] "World of Instruments" [...] segment of John Safran's Music Jamboree, where they played [...] "Dirty Jeans" [...] using Indonesian gamelans - struck instruments including metallophones and xylophones.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Magic Dirt {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract with - ironically - Warner Music Australia, and began recording their third album, What Are Rockstars <b>Doing</b> <b>Today</b> with Phil Vinall (Placebo) producing. Released in October, What Are Rockstars <b>Doing</b> <b>Today</b> {{reached the top}} 40. It signalled a dramatic shift in the band's sound. Gone were the fuzzy guitars and feedback. In its place was slick production and poppy hooks. Longtime fans of the band weren't sure {{what to make of}} lead single, [...] "Dirty Jeans", with its hand claps and sing-a-long chorus. Tracks such as [...] "Pace It" [...] and [...] "City Trash" [...] proved that the band could still rock, however they did receive some backlash, with some fans labelling them [...] "sell-outs". Triple J put [...] "Dirty Jeans" [...] on high rotation and it reached No. 12 in the year's Hottest 100. The year ended with national tour supporting Powderfinger and Jebediah.|$|E
