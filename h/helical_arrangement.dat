Their surprisingly high specific rotations are well reproduced by DFT/SCI computations and stem {{from the fact that}} these hydrocarbons essentially are σ-helicenes (i. e., rigidly held <b>helical</b> <b>arrangements</b> of σ-bonds). Some light is shed on the properties of radical cations derived from [3]- and [4]rotanes. While the former adopts C s or C 2 v symmetry, the latter retains the D 4 h symmetry of the neutral hydrocarbon, according to highlevel computations. Experimental and computational evidence is also presented that the antiaromatic cyclopentadienyl cation is stabilized as a singlet ground state by five cyclopropyl substituents. Yet, the three cyclopropyl groups in tricyclopropylamine do not favor the formation of its radical cation, because they are not in the proper orientation. When this amine radical cation is generated by cobalt γ-irradiation in a Freon matrix, evidence for a significant conformational change is obtained by EPR spectroscopy.

Voltage gated sodium channels are large, multimeric complexes, composed of a single α subunit and one or more β subunits, an illustration {{of which may be}} observed in the adjacent image. The α subunit folds into four homologous domains, each of which contain six α-helical transmembrane segments. [...] The S4 segments of each domain serve as voltage sensors for activation. Each S4 segment consists of a repeating structure of one positively charged residue and two hydrophobic residues, and these combine to form a <b>helical</b> <b>arrangement.</b> When the channel is depolarized these S4 segments undergo a conformational change that widens the <b>helical</b> <b>arrangement</b> and opens the sodium-channel pore. Within milliseconds after the pore’s opening, the intracellular loop that connects domains III and IV, binds to the channel’s intracellular pore, inactivating the channel.

The increase of amylose content in flour leads to a more persistent “crystalline” structure.

Granule swelling tests in glycerol excess confirmed that the melting of crystallites is not a sufficient condition for complete dissolution of the granule. The granule swelling takes place in two steps for flours containing amylose, and occurs largely after gelatinization due to the importance of the granule envelope. The strength of this envelope, due to the presence of networks including proteins, lipids and amylose, is different between standard maize flour and starch. Tests in presence of lauric acid highlight the role of lipids on the granule envelope strength. The change in the viscosity of the granule/glycerol suspension during gelatinization is explained by granule swelling and can be described by a Krieger–Dougherty equation...|$|R
