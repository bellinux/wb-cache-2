The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the quest}} for {{recorded}} moving images was a more complex challenge. In the 1890s, moving pictures of any kind (whether taken with visible light or with <b>invisible</b> <b>radiation)</b> were emerging technologies. Because the word photography (literally [...] "recording/engraving with light") was long since established as connoting a still-image medium, the word cinematography (literally [...] "recording/engraving movement") was coined for the new medium of visible-light moving pictures. Soon several new words were coined for achieving moving radiographic pictures. This was often done either by filming a simple fluoroscopic screen with a movie camera (variously called fluorography, cinefluorography, photofluorography, or fluororadiography) or by taking serial radiographs rapidly {{to serve as the}} frames in a movie (cineradiography). Either way, the resulting film reel could be displayed by a movie projector. Another group of techniques were various kinds of kymography, whose common theme was capturing recordings in a series of moments, with a concept similar to movie film although not necessarily with movie-type playback; rather, the sequential images would be compared frame by frame (a distinction comparable to tile mode versus cine mode in today's CT terminology). Thus electrokymography and roentgenkymography were among the early ways to record images from a simple fluoroscopic screen.|$|E

50|$|A {{microphone}} is used {{to capture}} the input of sound waves created by people speaking into the device. The sounds are then turned into electrical energy; this energy then flows along a metal antenna. As the electrons in the electric current {{move back and forth}} up the antenna, the current creates an <b>invisible</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> in the form of radio waves. The waves travel at the speed of light, taking the radio program (voices recorded) with them.|$|R
2500|$|Infrared lasers are {{particularly}} hazardous, since the body's protective glare aversion response, {{also referred to}} as the [...] "blink reflex," [...] is triggered only by visible light. For example, some people exposed to high power Nd:YAG laser emitting <b>invisible</b> 1064nm <b>radiation</b> may not feel pain or notice immediate damage to their eyesight. A pop or click noise emanating from the eyeball may be the only indication that retinal damage has occurred i.e. the retina was heated to over 100 °C resulting in localized explosive boiling accompanied by the immediate creation of a permanent blind spot.|$|R

Hill v.

Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Board, which barred New York from certifying a bargaining unit of foremen, suggested the presence of <b>invisible</b> <b>radiations</b> from denial of national protections. Congress in 1947 could not foresee, however, the problems projected by these decisions, particularly when federal law was changed from the unilateral limitations of the Wagner Act to the bilateral limitations of Taft-Hartley. The still-born cession clause of section 10 (a) and the piecemeal provisions of section 14 proved wholly inadequate. Comprehensive national regulation carried unexpected implications for state law. Garner v. Teamsters Union found in the picketing provisions an implied prohibition of state restraints; and Guss v.

25|$|In 1852, in {{his famous}} paper on the change of {{wavelength}} of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert <b>invisible</b> ultra-violet <b>radiation</b> into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes' honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, {{is the basis of}} Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.|$|R

50|$|Optical {{brightener}} {{is used to}} make paper appear whiter.

50|$|In practice, ND {{filters are}} not perfect, {{as they do}} not reduce the {{intensity}} of all wavelengths equally. This can sometimes create color casts in recorded images, particularly with inexpensive filters. More significantly, most ND filters are only specified over the visible region of the spectrum and do not proportionally block all wavelengths of ultraviolet or infrared radiation. This can be dangerous if using ND filters to view sources (such as the Sun or white-hot metal or glass), which emit intense <b>invisible</b> <b>radiation,</b> since the eye may be damaged even though the source does not look bright when viewed through the filter. Special filters must be used if such sources are to be safely viewed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of infrared radiation {{is attributed to}} William Herschel, who performed an experiment where he placed a thermometer in sunlight of different colors after it passed through a prism.

40|$|The {{hazards of}} large high power lasers are well recognized, and the {{necessity}} for controlling these hazards justifiably enjoys wide consensus. However, physically small lasers, or those with relatively low output power (e. g. Class 3 B), can also present significant safety issues. The safety aspects of such small or lower power lasers often suffer from neglect because of the tendency to downplay, ignore, or simply fail to recognize the associated hazards. This work will assist safety professionals in identifying and articulating these “harder to sell ” hazards by reviewing the specific issues (e. g. <b>invisible</b> laser <b>radiation,</b> potential for electrical shock, and even thermal/fire damage to materials), {{as well as providing}} some specific examples of readily available lasers for which these hazards exist. Finally, this paper addresses controlling those hazards through better recognition of the laser technology involved, and by proper work habits to minimize the chances of accidents and injuries associated with such laser system...|$|R
