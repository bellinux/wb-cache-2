40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{algorithm}} to integrate image registration into image super-resolution (SR). Image SR {{is a process}} to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image by fusing multiple low-resolution (LR) images. A critical step in image SR is accurate registration of the LR images or, in other words, effective estimation of motion parameters. Conventional SR algo-rithms assume either the estimated motion parameters by <b>existing</b> <b>registration</b> methods to be error-free or the motion parameters are known a priori. This assumption, however, is impractical in many applications, as most <b>existing</b> <b>registration</b> algorithms still experience various degrees of errors, and the motion parameters among the LR images are generally unknown a priori. In view of this, this paper presents a new framework that performs si-multaneous image registration and HR image reconstruction. As opposed to other current methods that treat image registration and HR reconstruction as disjoint processes, the new framework enables image registration and HR reconstruction to be estimated simultaneously and improved progressively. Further, unlike most algorithms {{that focus on the}} translational motion model, the proposed method adopts a more generic motion model that includes both translation as well as rotation. An iterative scheme is developed to solve the arising nonlinear least squares problem. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in performing image registration and SR for simulated as well as real-life images.

The <b>existing</b> <b>registration</b> procedure complicates equity transaction and transfer, making it inconvenient for investors to trade equities and liquidate their investments, thereby hindering equity circulation. The lack of liquidity of equity {{is associated with}} high risk, which discourages investors from investing, and is detrimental to crowd fundraisers who want to successfully raise funds and obtain high valuations of their businesses (Lee and Wu 2003). If equity transaction and transfer become efficient, then investors can more easily transfer equities and liquidate their investments, the liquidity of equity increases, and market transactions are activated. This will have positive impacts on both investors and crowdfunders.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Serial-section {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM) is an important imaging modality for studying neuronal connectivity patterns. However, before serial-section TEM images {{can be used to}} reconstruct connectivities of neurons, several image registration problems must be addressed. The first problem arises due to the large sample size and limited field of view: each section must be assembled from many overlapping tiles, a process also referred to as mosaicing. The second problem is the co-registration of slice mosaics into a single three-dimensional volume. In both problems, non-linear distortions of individual images must be corrected. We present a carefully engineered solution to these problems making by modifying <b>existing</b> <b>registration</b> paradigms to better fit the requirements of serial-section TEM images. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a defocus-invariant image registration method {{for measuring the}} shifting value between two differently located patterns in an imaging sensor. <b>Existing</b> <b>registration</b> methods fail with unfocused images since features or regions of interest are degraded by defocus. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method consists of three stages: i) pre-generation of the set of point spread functions (PSFs) estimated in different focusing positions, ii) the geometric transformation estimation using estimated PSF data, and iii) registration using estimated transformation matrix. The proposed method improves out-of-focus degradation through estimation of PSF. For this reason, the proposed method can accurately estimate the difference of phase between two out-of-focus images. Furthermore, it {{can be applied to}} phase-difference detection auto focusing, and provide accurate auto focusing performance.

The spatial resolution of the data {{is much higher than}} that of conventional surveying methods. The data collected from different locations of a laser scanner must be transformed into a common coordinate system. If good a priori alignment is provided and the point clouds share a large overlapping region, <b>existing</b> <b>registration</b> methods, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) or Chen and Medioni’s method, work well. In practical applications of laser scanners, partially overlapping and unorganised point clouds are provided without good initial alignment. In these cases, the <b>existing</b> <b>registration</b> methods are not appropriate since it becomes very difficult to find the correspondence of the point clouds. A registration method, the Geometric Primitive ICP with the RANSAC (GPICPR), using geometric primitives, neighbourhood search, the positional uncertainty of laser scanners, and an outlier removal procedure is proposed in this thesis. The change of geometric curvature and approximate normal vector of the surface formed by a point and its neighbourhood are used for selecting the possible correspondences of point clouds. In addition, an explicit expression of the position uncertainty of measurement by laser scanners is presented in this dissertation and this position uncertainty is utilised to estimate the precision and accuracy of the estimated relative transformation parameters between point clouds. The GP-ICPR was tested with both simulated data and datasets from close range and terrestrial laser scanners in terms of its precision, accuracy, and convergence region. It was shown that the GP-ICPR improved the precision of the estimated relative transformation parameters as much as a factor of 5. In addition, the rotational convergence region of the GP-ICPR on the order of 10 °, which is much larger than the ICP or its variants, provides a window of opportunity to utilise this automated registration method in practical applications such as terrestrial surveying and deformation monitoring...|$|R
