5000|$|An altered {{level of}} {{consciousness}} is any measure of arousal other than normal. Level of consciousness (LOC) is a measurement of a person's arousability and responsiveness to stimuli from the environment. [...] A mildly depressed level of consciousness or alertness may be classed as lethargy; someone {{in this state}} can be aroused with little difficulty. [...] People who are obtunded have a more depressed level of consciousness and cannot be <b>fully</b> <b>aroused.</b> [...] Those who {{are not able to}} be aroused from a sleep-like state are said to be stuporous. Coma is the inability to make any purposeful response. [...] Scales such as the Glasgow coma scale have been designed to measure the level of consciousness.|$|R

Yes, a yellow-skinned, almond-eyed, Mongolian-featured Chinaman, with a long pigtail hanging down his back, and attired in the official amber silk robe and purple slippers of a mandarin of the third grade, and the silver button. My curiosity was so <b>fully</b> <b>aroused</b> by this strange discovery that I determined to learn something more about so curious a product of an alien civilization; and therefore, after a few minutes, I managed to give Miss Amelia Hogg the slip by drawing in young Harry Farquhar the artist at the hundred-and-twentieth section, and making my way quietly across the room to Mrs. Bouverie Barton.|$|R
40|$|Food-avoidance {{conditioning}} in the mollusk Pleurobranchaea {{results in}} {{suppression of the}} feeding response to food stimuli. In conditioned animals, identified interneurons of the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding behavior, the Int- 2 s, respond to a food stimulus with greater and more long-lasting excitation than controls. Enhanced Int- 2 responsiveness to food stimuli is associated with markedly heightened Int- 2 excitability. Sustained activity in the Int- 2 s arrests motor output of the oscillatory CPG in the protraction/retraction movement cycle of feeding through tonic excitation of a population of retractor interneurons and inhibition of protractors. The CPG locus of the learning mechanism is permissive of sensory excitation of alternative behavior and leaves the possibility open for release of the suppressed behavior in a <b>fully</b> <b>aroused</b> state...|$|R

A few words were sufficient for the purpose. I found that these mysterious personages, whom I had mistaken for magi, were principally authors, and were in the very act of manufacturing books. I was, in fact, in the reading-room of the great British Library, an immense collection of volumes of all ages and languages, many of which are now forgotten, and most of which are seldom read: one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature to which modern authors repair, and draw buckets full of classic lore, or [...] "pure English, undefiled," [...] wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of thought.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a common}} belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent {{scientific}} {{research has shown that}} there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become <b>fully</b> <b>aroused.</b> Scientists from McGill University Health Centre in Montreal (in Canada) used the method of thermal imaging to record baseline temperature change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and {{came to the conclusion that}} on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal ‚Äî around 10 minutes.

40|$|In {{the recent}} decade, {{the family of}} Heusler {{compounds}} has attracted tremendous scientific and technological interest {{in the field of}} spintronics. This is essentially due to their exceptional magnetic properties, which qualify them as promising functional materials in various data-storage devices, such as giant-magnetoresistance spin valves, magnetic tunnel junctions, and spin-transfer torque devices. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on the applications of the Heusler family in magnetic data storage. In addition to their important roles in the performance improvement of these devices, we also try to point out the challenges as well as possible solutions, of the current Heusler-based devices.

2500|$|During sexual arousal, and {{particularly}} the stimulation of the clitoris, {{the walls of the}} vagina lubricate. This begins after ten to thirty seconds of sexual arousal, and increases in amount the longer the woman is aroused. It reduces friction or injury that can be caused by insertion of the penis into the vagina or other penetration of the vagina during sexual activity. The vagina lengthens during the arousal, and can continue to lengthen in response to pressure; as the woman becomes <b>fully</b> <b>aroused,</b> the vagina expands in length and width, while the cervix retracts. With the upper two-thirds of the vagina expanding and lengthening, the uterus rises into the greater pelvis, and the cervix is elevated above the vaginal floor, resulting in tenting of the mid-vaginal plane. This is known as the tenting or ballooning effect. [...] As the elastic walls of the vagina stretch or contract, with support from the pelvic muscles, to wrap around the inserted penis (or other object), this stimulates the penis and helps to cause a man to experience orgasm and ejaculation, which in turn enables fertilization.|$|R

The patient slept constantly day and night and was awoken by her family for about three-hour period of time. The duration of hypersomnia was about one year until the onset of treatment. The patient was successfully treated with light therapy that caused gradual resolution of the symptoms of hypersomnia. The patient is also treated as prior to the onset of hypersomnia with antipsychotics and the mood stabilizers for schizoaffective disorder.

60|$|In his cruel {{disappointment}} and <b>fully</b> <b>aroused</b> indignation, he at once {{began to suspect}} a connection of circumstances which at any other moment he would have thought purely accidental, or perhaps not have considered at all. The cavity in the tree had evidently {{been used as a}} secret receptacle for letters before; did Mamie know it at the time, and how did she know it? The apparent age of the letter made it preposterous to suppose that it pointed to any secret correspondence of hers with young Mr. Slinn; and the address was not in her handwriting. Was there any secret previous intimacy between the families? There was but one way in which he could connect this letter with Mamie's faithlessness. It was an infamous, a grotesquely horrible idea, a thought which sprang as much from his inexperience of the world and his habitual suspiciousness of all humor as anything else! It was that the letter was a brutal joke of Slinn's--a joke perhaps concocted by Mamie and himself--a parting insult that should at the last moment proclaim their treachery and his own credulity. Doubtless it contained a declaration of their shame, and the reason why she had fled from him without a word of explanation. And the enclosure, of course, was some significant and degrading illustration. Those Americans are full of those low conceits; it was their national vulgarity.|$|R

She began walking with quick, uneven steps up and down the room. Matravers forgot to drink his coffee. He was watching her with a curious sense of emotional excitement. The little chamber was full of half lights and shadows, and there seemed to him something almost unearthly about this woman with her soft grey gown and marble face. He was stirred by her presence in a new way. The rustle of her silken skirts as she swept {{in and out of the}} dim light, the delicate whiteness of her arms and throat, the flashing of a single diamond in her dark coiled hair,--these seemed trivial things enough, yet they were yielding him a new and mysterious pleasure. For the first time his sense of her beauty was <b>fully</b> <b>aroused.</b> Every now and then he caught faint glimpses of her face. It was like the face of a new woman to him. There was some tender and wonderful change there, which he could not understand, and yet which seemed to strike some responsive chord in his own emotions. Instinctively he felt that she was passing into a new phase of life. Surely, he, too, was walking hand and hand with her through the shadows! The touch of her interlaced fingers had burned his flesh.|$|R

6000|$|Stretched at ease upon a sofa, in {{gown and}} slippers, Harker Brayton {{smiled as he}} read the {{foregoing}} sentence in old Morryster's Marvells of Science. [...] "The only marvel in the matter," [...] he said to himself, [...] "is that the wise and learned in Morryster's day should have believed such nonsense as is rejected by most of even the ignorant in ours." [...] A train of reflection followed--for Brayton {{was a man of}} thought--and he unconsciously lowered his book without altering the direction of his eyes. As soon as the volume had gone below the line of sight, something in an obscure corner of the room recalled his attention to his surroundings. What he saw, in the shadow under his bed, was two small points of light, apparently about an inch apart. They might have been reflections of the gas jet above him, in metal nail heads; he gave them but little thought and resumed his reading. A moment later something-- some impulse which it did not occur to him to analyze--impelled him to lower the book again and seek for what he saw before. The points of light were still there. They seemed to have become brighter than before, shining with a greenish lustre that he had not at first observed. He thought, too, that they might have moved a trifle--were somewhat nearer. They were still too much in shadow, however, to reveal their nature and origin to an indolent attention, and again he resumed his reading. Suddenly something in the text suggested a thought that made him start and drop the book for the third time {{to the side of the}} sofa, whence, escaping from his hand, it fell sprawling to the floor, back upward. Brayton, half-risen, was staring intently into the obscurity beneath the bed, where the points of light shone with, it seemed to him, an added fire. His attention was now <b>fully</b> <b>aroused,</b> his gaze eager and imperative. It disclosed, almost directly under the foot-rail of the bed, the coils of a large serpent--the points of light were its eyes! Its horrible head, thrust flatly forth from the innermost coil and resting upon the outermost, was directed straight toward him, the definition of the wide, brutal jaw and the idiot-like forehead serving to show the direction of its malevolent gaze. The eyes were no longer merely luminous points; they looked into his own with a meaning, a malign significance.|$|R

60|$|I first {{observed}} an alteration in {{his conduct}} while rubbing in the phosphorus {{on the paper}} in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited {{at the time to}} pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became <b>fully</b> <b>aroused.</b> He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design--missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left me--then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.|$|R
