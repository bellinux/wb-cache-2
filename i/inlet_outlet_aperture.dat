40|$|Abstract. A {{two-dimensional}} turbulence k-ε {{model is}} used to predict the distribution of air velocity, temperature and turbulence kinetic energy in a ventilated room using different positions of <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>apertures.</b> The Navier Stockes, energy and turbulence equations are solved using finite volume techniques with staggered grid. The characteristics of air flow are analyzed under different parameters such as <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> positions, aspect ratio and air supply velocities. This study {{is focused on the}} prediction of turbulent recirculating flows in large indoor spaces. The results show that the wall jet region and recirculation regions are affected by the position of <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>apertures.</b> Also the results indicate that recirculation regions are increased with increasing Reynolds number and decrease with decreasing aspect ratio.

40|$|The morphoanatomy, {{cellular}} organization, {{and surface}} {{architecture of the}} olfactory apparatus in Cirrhinus reba (Hamilton) is described using light and scanning electron microscopy. The oval shaped olfactory rosette contained 32 ± 2 primary lamellae {{on each side of}} the median raphe, and was lodged on the floor of the olfactory chamber. The olfactory lamellae were basically flat and compactly arranged in the rosette. The olfactory chamber communicated to the outside aquatic environment through <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>apertures</b> with a conspicuous nasal flap in between. The mid dorsal portion of the olfactory lamellae was characterized by a linguiform process. Sensory and non-sensory regions were distributed separately on each lamella. The sensory epithelium occupied the apical part including the linguiform process, whereas the resting part of the lamella was covered with non-sensory epithelium. The sensory epithelium comprised both ciliated and microvillous receptor cells distinguished by the architecture on their apical part. The non-sensory epithelium possessed mucous cells, labyrinth cells, and stratified epithelial cells with distinctive microridges. The functional importance of the different cells lining the olfactory mucosa was correlated with the ecological habits of the fish examined...|$|R

The piston charger charges the main {{cylinder}} and simultaneously regulates the <b>inlet</b> and the <b>outlet</b> <b>aperture,</b> leading to {{no loss of}} air and fuel in the exhaust. In the main cylinder, combustion takes place every turn as in a two-stroke engine and lubrication as in a four-stroke. Fuel injection can {{take place in the}} piston charger, in the gas-transfer channel or in the combustion chamber. It is also possible to charge two working cylinders with one piston charger. The combination of compact design for the combustion chamber together with no loss of air and fuel is claimed to give the engine more torque, more power and better fuel consumption. The benefit of fewer moving parts and design is claimed to lead to lower manufacturing costs. Good for hybrid technology and stationary engines. The engine is claimed to be suited to alternative, fuels since there is no corrosion or deposits left on valves.The six strokes are: ...|$|R

30|$|A more {{advanced}} LVW approach involves {{a series of}} dedicated injection boreholes located {{along the length of}} a coal seam [21]. Over the life of a UCG reactor, the coal face, being gasified, travels as localized coal is exhausted [4]. Having multiple boreholes for injection allows for improved static operating conditions. A more complex variation of the LVW method also exists where multiple <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> boreholes are drilled into a coal seam, forming <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> borehole pairs. Parallel <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> manifolds are connected to the boreholes to provide a path for oxidant and syngas flows, respectively. Coal between each pair of <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> boreholes forms a zone. When the coal in a zone has been exhausted, new boreholes are drilled in a location of fresh coal, forming new zones [21].|$|R

30|$|While some {{surgeons}} advocate {{relying on}} computer-assisted and navigated systems, {{it is common}} to utilize <b>inlet,</b> <b>outlet,</b> and lateral fluoroscopic images to safely instrument the posterior pelvic ring [1, 2, 7, 12, 21 – 23]. Obtaining quality intraoperative fluoroscopic images remains incredibly important and being able to correctly interpret the radiographic landmarks of the pelvis and their relationship to anatomical structures is mandatory [7, 24, 25]. In addition to the fracture pattern and displacement, preoperative CT scans demonstrate the osteology of each patient. Utilizing the preoperative CT, anticipated <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> angles can be measured and brought to the operating room to help the surgeon and radiology technician obtain accurate intraoperative imaging.

40|$|During open-heart surgery roller {{pumps are}} often used to keep the {{circulation}} of blood through the patient body. They present numerous key features, but they suffer from several limitations: (a) they normally deliver uncontrolled pulsatile <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> pressure; (b) blood damage {{appears to be more}} than that encountered with centrifugal pumps. A lumped parameter mathematical model of a roller pump (Sarns 7000, Terumo CVS, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was developed to dynamically simulate pressures at the pump <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> in order to clarify the uncontrolled pulsation mechanism. <b>Inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> pressures obtained by the mathematical model have been compared with those measured in various operating conditions: different rollers' rotating speed, different tube occlusion rates, and different clamping degree at the pump <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet.</b> Model results agree with measured pressure waveforms, whose oscillations are generated by the tube compression/release mechanism during the rollers' engaging and disengaging phases. Average Euclidean Error (AEE) was 20 mmHg and 33 mmHg for <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> pressure estimates, respectively. The normalized AEE never exceeded 0. 16.

30|$|Average size of {{whey powder}} {{particles}} produced for ten samples {{is given in}} Table  3. The mean particle diameters (Mean D) of all the powders produced by pilot-plant spray dryer were {{in the range of}} 11.26 – 18.23  μm. It can be observed that by increasing the <b>inlet</b> (<b>outlet)</b> air temperature, the diameter of the particles increased. By increasing the inlet air temperature, the top surface dried quickly. This hard layer did not allow internal moisture to leave the particle and led it to inflation, which increased the particle size. Comparing pilot-plant with industrial samples, it can be inferred that although industrial samples are more homogenous, they are similar to each other regarding particle size. <b>Inlet</b> (<b>outlet)</b> air temperature above water boiling point leads to water boiling in the drops; consequently, particles are inflamed and diameter of the particles increases. In addition, by decreasing solid content, particles would have thinner shell which causes faster evaporation. Thus, particles take a wrinkled form with smaller diameter.|$|R
