25|$|A gracious, charming man in {{an old-fashioned}} Austrian manner, he seemed in later life almost the archetypal {{professor}} of popular imagination, with straggly white hair, wayward handwriting, and an infectious enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> caught his attention. Like Goethe he believed that literature could {{have an effect on}} individuals and mould them into world citizens. As a teacher he had a rare ability to bring poetry alive, and published on it prolifically.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the name}} of the band, or the band's logo, the members do not {{consider}} themselves antitheist. Singer Greg Graffin states that more often than not, the band prefers to use religion as a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> does not allow for an individual's freedom to think or express themselves as they choose. In this way, their songs are more about anti-conformity than anti-religion. Contrary to popular belief, Greg Graffin does not identify himself as an atheist, but chooses to identify as a naturalist.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Knox, Romanelli arrived at the flat. Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging around, looking <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene. On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with her had been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a duvet.|$|E
25|$|Guernica {{quickly became}} a world-renowned symbol of {{civilian}} suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into Guernica. The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso never cared much <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{had to do with}} politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his commissioned work for Spain into a reflection on the massacre.|$|E

The Soviets looted the ruins of Shōwa Steel Works <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could be taken back to the Soviet Union. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, Anshan was returned to China {{along with the rest of}} Chinese Manchuria. However, peace had not yet arrived. Civil war continued between the Chinese Nationalist Government and the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA). The city of Anshan was the scene of one of the battles of this war. The city was taken by the PLA on February 19, 1948. A monument in Lieshishan park commemorates the battle.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{donors are}} {{evaluated}} <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases {{that can be}} transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination {{to make sure the}} donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days) between whole blood donations but only seven days between plateletpheresis donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis.|$|E
25|$|The {{proceedings}} of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but, {{a new generation of}} teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed {{in the name of the}} German people. In 1963, a German court ruled that a KGB assassin named Bohdan Stashynsky who had committed several murders in the Federal Republic in the late 1950s was not legally guilty of murder, but was only an accomplice to murder as the responsibility for Stashinsky's murders rested only with his superiors in Moscow who had given him his orders. The legal implications of the Stashinksy case, namely that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers can be held legally responsible for any murders committed and that anyone else who follows orders and commits murders were just accomplices to murder was to greatly hinder the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the coming decades, and ensured that even when convicted, that Nazi criminals received the far lighter sentences reserved for accomplices to murders than the harsher sentences given to murderers. The term executive decision-maker who could be found guilty of murder was reserved by the courts only for those at the highest levels of the Reich leadership during the Nazi period. The only way that a Nazi criminal could be convicted of murder was to show that they were not following orders at the time and had acted on their initiative when killing someone. One courageous attorney, Fritz Bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz death camp and about twenty were put trial in Frankfurt between 1963-1965 in what came to be known as the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials. The men on trial in Frankfurt were tried only for murders and other crimes that they committed on their own initiative at Auschwitz and were not tried <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> they did at Auschwitz when following orders, which was considered by the courts to be the lesser crime of accomplice to murder. Because of this, Bauer could only indict for murder those who killed when not following orders, and those who had killed when following orders were indicted as accomplices to murder. Moreover because of the legal distinction between murderers and accomplices to murder, an SS man who killed thousands while operating the gas chambers at Auschwitz could only be found guilty of being accomplice to murder because he had been following orders, while an SS man who had beaten one inmate to death on his initiative could be convicted of murder because he had not been following orders. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the Shoah was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term 'Holocaust' for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when an American mini-series with that name was shown on German television.) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.|$|E

However, he was negative towards the Heather–Logan subplot and dynamic, referring to Heather as a type of Manic Pixie Dream Girl who is not sexualized.
