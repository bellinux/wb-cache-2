5|$|Later, Charming tracks Snow and nets {{her in a}} trap. Snow reluctantly {{agrees to}} show Charming where she sold his jewels. Along the way, Charming discovers a wanted poster of Snow in her bag. Snow claims the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) blames her for ruining her life. Charming asks if this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> she admits it is.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought as}} enounced {{in the first}} stanza is the {{supremacy}} of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered... which gives an effect of poverty {{in spite of the}} beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.|$|E

25|$|Some {{examples}} of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to {{the proposition that}} a proposed law of physics <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> <b>and</b> to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, {{based on the evidence}} presented.|$|E
50|$|But {{one could}} {{construct}} an argument {{in which the}} premises are inconsistent.

50|$|He {{disagreed}} with Diodorus Cronus concerning his Master Argument, arguing {{that something is}} possible which can never <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> <b>and</b> that the impossible can never be the consequence of the possible, and that therefore not everything that has happened <b>is</b> necessarily <b>true.</b> Diodorus' view <b>was</b> that everything that has happened must <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> <b>and</b> that therefore nothing is possible which can never <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R

25|$|Avocados in savory dishes, {{often seen}} as exotic, are a {{relative}} novelty in Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Brazil, where the traditional preparation is mashed with sugar and lime, and eaten as a dessert or snack. This contrasts with Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Mexico, or Argentina, where the opposite <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> sweet preparations are rare.|$|E
25|$|One {{proof of}} the number's irrationality is the {{following}} proof by infinite descent. It is also a proof by contradiction, also known as an indirect proof, in that the proposition is proved by assuming that {{the opposite of the}} proposition <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> showing that this assumption is false, thereby implying that the proposition must be true.|$|E

50|$|Graham Priest advocates {{the view}} that under some conditions, some {{statements}} can <b>be</b> both <b>true</b> <b>and</b> false simultaneously, or may <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> false at different times. Dialetheism arises from formal logical paradoxes, such as the Liar's paradox and Russell's paradox.|$|R

25|$|The {{details of}} this {{characterization}} depend on the choice of set-theoretic axiomatization used to formalize mathematics. In particular, in models of set theory for which Martin's axiom <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> the continuum hypothesis is false, the class of bipartite graphs in this characterization can {{be replaced by a}} single forbidden minor. However, for models in which the continuum hypothesis is true, this class contains graphs which are incomparable with each other in the minor ordering.|$|E
25|$|Chapter 14 defines saving {{faith as}} that which enables people to believe to the saving of their souls. The {{confession}} states {{that it is the}} work of the Holy Spirit and is ordinarily accomplished by the preaching of the word. Saving faith is strengthened and increased by the preaching of the word, the sacraments, and prayer. This faith enables a person to believe that whatever is revealed in the Bible <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> to rest on Christ alone for eternal life.|$|E
25|$|Which means: if P and its {{negation}} ¬P {{are both}} {{assumed to be}} true, then P {{is assumed to be}} true, from which it follows {{that at least one of}} the claims P and some other (arbitrary) claim A is true. However, if we know that either P or A <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> <b>and</b> also that P is not true (that ¬P is true) we can conclude that A, which could be anything, is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, it is trivial—that is, it has every sentence as a theorem.|$|E

25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels {{might have been}} proud. Haggard says he knows nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies {{and goes on to}} say that some evangelicals think of his services as something akin to rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E
25|$|How is the {{enormous}} {{diversity in the}} shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There is enormous variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and palea, that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the dicot petals and carpels respectively.It turns out that this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> <b>and</b> the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and bilateral. These symmetries are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|E
25|$|Establishing the {{identity}} of the person posting illegal content is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like SMTP email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source. In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their network address, but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.|$|E

25|$|Incompatibilism may occupy any of {{the nine}} {{positions}} except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to soft determinism. Position (1) is hard determinism, and position (2) is libertarianism. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that D implies FW is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that FW implies D is untrue. Position (9) may be called hard incompatibilism if one interprets ? as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. Compatibilism itself may occupy {{any of the}} nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to compatibilism is {{that some form of}} determinism <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> yet we have some form of free will, position (3).|$|E
25|$|Some {{conceive}} {{free will}} {{to be the}} capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived. This problem has been identified in ancient Greek philosophy, and remains {{a major focus of}} philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism, and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism, the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and hard determinism, the claim that determinism <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses hard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will, and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.|$|E
25|$|Proof. Consider a {{complete}} graph on R(r−1, s) + R(r, s−1) vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours. Pick a vertex v from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets M and N, such {{that for every}} vertex w, w is in M if (v, w) is blue, and w is in N if (v, w) is red. Because the graph has R(r − 1, s) + R(r, s − 1) = |M| + |N| + 1 vertices, it follows that either |M| ≥ R(r − 1, s) or |N| ≥ R(r, s − 1). In the former case, if M has a red Ks then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise M has a blue K'r−1 and so M ∪ {v} has blue Kr by definition of M. The latter case is analogous. Thus the claim <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>and</b> we have completed the proof for 2 colours.|$|E
