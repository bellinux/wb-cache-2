5|$|Digital {{forensics}} <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> {{not restricted}} to retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of these devices have volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources. Depending {{on the type of}} devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> branched into various types.|$|E

5|$|On April 24, the {{astronomer}} David Charbonneau, {{who led the}} team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water.

5|$|The {{technical}} aspect of an <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> divided into several sub-branches, {{relating to the}} type of digital devices involved; computer forensics, network forensics, forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics. The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method under <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> reversible {{inhibition of}} sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E

A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, {{families}} of American {{victims of the}} attacks filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn, New York, naming Lt. Gen.

5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> to {{experimentally}} determine deflection data for 0 to 180 degree uniform thickness cantilever sectors. The basic deflection data {{is presented in the}} form of influence coefficients that can be utilized in the determination of the deflection of sectors as caused by any regular transverse loading. One phase of the <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> specifically planned to achieve results that could be compared with an analytical solution of the problem. In addition to the basic experimentation, preliminary <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> made of the effect of thickness and boundary fixity on the stiffness of cantilever sectors. Deflection modes as calculated from the data of this <b>investigation</b> <b>were</b> in close agreement with those determined by the analytical solution. Agreement in absolute magnitude was of the order of 15 percent for three loading conditions checked. Further investigation into the effect of thickness is considered desirable before the results of this <b>investigation</b> <b>are</b> applied to the determination of deflections for sectors of different thickness from those used in the <b>investigation.</b> The <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> carried out in the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California. ...|$|R

5|$|Mississippi Burning is a 1988 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Alan Parker, and written by Chris Gerolmo. It is {{loosely based on}} the FBI's investigation into the 1964 Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner murder case in Mississippi. The film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents assigned to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi. The <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> met with hostility and backlash by the town's residents, local police and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).|$|E
5|$|Not much of Nerva's {{early life}} or career is recorded, {{but it appears}} he did not pursue the usual {{administrative}} or military career. He was praetor-elect in the year 65 and, like his ancestors, moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist. As an advisor to Emperor Nero, he successfully helped detect and expose the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. His exact contribution to the <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> not known, but his services must have been considerable, since they earned him rewards equal to those of Nero's guard prefect Tigellinus. He received triumphal honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — {{and the right to}} have his statues placed throughout the palace.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> needed to determine this.|$|E

However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E

Mulder believes Wharton is persecuting the refugees after the suicide of some of his men during a previous trip to Haiti. Scully finds Dunham dead in a bathtub, and Mulder catches McAlpin with a knife nearby. Although he has no recollection of the event, McAlpin confesses to the murder under the influence of Wharton, who tells the agents that Bauvais committed suicide and that their <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> over.|$|E
