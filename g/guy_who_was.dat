25|$|Tracht {{found a home}} at WAPE in Jacksonville, Florida, in August 1975 {{and became}} the {{dominant}} radio personality not just in northeast Florida, but in the Southeastern United States While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung {{in the window of}} the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.|$|E

[...] Unlike other consulting firms, which issued recommendations and then departed, Bain & Company [...] immersed itself in a clients' businesses and worked with them until changes were implemented. Romney became a vice-president of the firm in 1978, working with such clients as the Monsanto Company, Outboard Marine Corporation, Burlington Industries, and Corning Incorporated. Within a few years, the firm considered him one of its best consultants. In fact, clients sometimes preferred to use him rather than more-senior partners.|$|E

500|$|Explaining that {{he wrote}} it as per his whim, and not {{according}} {{to the need to}} have more philosophy or love or war, Tripathi was sure that The Oath of the Vayuputras would have a tragic ending. During an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Tripathi explained that he had purposefully used the modern terms for the different historical locations described in the book, including calling India by its name, rather than its ancient name, Jambudweep. He did not believe that India could be represented as a political concept in his book, since at the timeline followed in the Shiva trilogy, India was still a cultural concept. Since some of the characters have their mythological names, but do not follow the characteristic traits, Tripathi believed that such development was spontaneous and did not question his writing further. Giving an example, the author said: [...] "When I was writing the first book, I was struggling with the Naga, because I wanted to desperately change his character – that he should be jovial and happy. But he kept ending up as a tormented and troubled a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> suffering. And I just had to surrender" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with Max Martin, Shellback; the latter two {{are responsible for the}} song's production. The song's lyrics and conception use a metaphor, comparing an older man to a prehistoric, carnivorous dinosaur. All three composers were responsible for providing the song's instruments. The song's recording was commenced at Maratone Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden, by Martin and Shellback. While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example. The singer explained that the song's conception was auto-biographical and that it stemmed from a previous experience she had when an older man had been hitting on her, which she elaborated on: [...] "I just write about what I live — literally, my entire record is totally autobiographical, because I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation. There's a song called 'Dinosaur' about this old <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, 'Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur. D-I-N-O-S-A-you are a dinosaur.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Gary Anderson's missed kick {{has been}} singled out as the main {{contributing}} factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able {{to capitalize on the}} late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss {{as one of the most}} devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to Chad Hartman, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, [...] " [...] will always be known as the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a part of screwing up the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." [...] ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including two further NFC Championship losses in 2000 and 2009. Cunningham concurred by claiming, [...] "With that kick, it just seemed like the whole franchise went wide left." ...|$|E

500|$|Ned Flanders, who was {{designed}} by Rich Moore, {{first appeared in the}} season one episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". The episode was the series premiere, but not the first episode produced. The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is season two's [...] "Dead Putting Society", which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders. The character was named after Flanders Street in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as [...] "just a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> truly nice, that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe, but then did". It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian. Mike Scully noted that Flanders is [...] "everything Homer would love to be, although he'll never admit it". Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used [...] "such a sweet voice" [...] and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer. Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering. His first use of the word [...] "diddly" [...] was in [...] "The Call of the Simpsons".|$|E
500|$|Dinklage {{found his}} {{breakthrough}} playing Finbar McBride, {{who is a}} quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man in the 2003 Tom McCarthy-directed film The Station Agent. According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind, Cannavale said McCarthy [...] "set out {{to tell a story}} about a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world", but when McCarthy actually started [...] "putting pen to paper" [...] for the screenplay he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually [...] "roles written for someone my size are a little flat"—often either comical or [...] "sort of Lord of the Rings" [...] type characters filled with wisdom; further: [...] "They're not sexual, they're not romantic" [...] and [...] "they're not flawed". What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has [...] "romantic feelings" [...] as well as [...] "anger and ... flaws". The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the New York Observer, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face." [...] Besides being Dinklage's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Station Agent was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The {{abundance}} of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen. Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. [...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15. I wrote the song when I was 16 with my mom, and I was like, [...] "This song's so dope, I know it is". [...] "Dinosaur" [...] came [...] "about [...] this old <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, [...] "Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur.
