5|$|In {{a return}} to the format of early seasons, {{virtually}} all serials from Seasons 18 through 20 are linked together, often running directly into each other. Season 18 forms a loose story arc dealing with the theme of entropy. <b>Full</b> <b>Circle,</b> State of Decay, and Warriors' Gate trace the Doctor's adventures in E-Space; they were released in both VHS and DVD boxsets with the umbrella title The E-Space Trilogy.|$|E
5|$|When {{operating}} a <b>full</b> <b>circle</b> route, trains start through the Common Tunnel. If running clockwise, {{they pass through}} all the common stations (Tøyen, Grønland, Jernbanetorget, Stortinget, Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen). They head north on the Sognsvann Line, stopping at Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion. The Ring Line proper then splits off, and the trains serve Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen, before Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line. After that, the trains again enter the Common Tunnel at Tøyen.|$|E
5|$|Full Circle: Carnegie Hall 2000 is a live album by Indian {{musician}} and composer Ravi Shankar, released in 2001 through the record label Angel Records. Recorded at Carnegie Hall in October 2000 {{as part of}} a tour with Shankar's daughter Anoushka, the album contains five tracks and presents two ragas. The concert occurred sixty-two years after Shankar's first performance at Carnegie Hall and commemorated his eightieth birthday; the album was his first live recording in nearly twenty years. <b>Full</b> <b>Circle</b> was produced by Hans Wendl, mastered by Scott Hull, and mixed and engineered by Tom Lazarus. Featured are performances by Tanmoy Bose and Bickram Ghosh on tabla, and Anoushka and Ravi on sitar.|$|E

5|$|The {{line will}} operate as M3 and M4. The former will run a <b>full</b> <b>circle,</b> while M4 will only {{operate on the}} eastern half from Copenhagen Central Station (København H) via Østerport to Nørrebro. This {{solution}} is temporary, once the metro network has been extended to Nordhavn, the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch. Later, when the Sydhavn extension has been completed, the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus. Trains will operate both ways through the circle. The line will have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv. The line is estimated to carry 240,000daily passengers, bringing the metro's total daily ridership to 460,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the Moon can be {{measured}} accurately, and is noticeably more complex {{than that of the}} planets. The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its line of nodes turns a <b>full</b> <b>circle</b> in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called Saros cycle. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} <b>full</b> <b>circle</b> versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for the selection of the I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors. Curiously, Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp.|$|E

5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason <b>full</b> <b>circle</b> in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|Elvas {{was reached}} by the Spanish army on 22 October and a siege begun. Although the fortifications could not ensure safety from a {{full-scale}} assault supported with heavy guns, they enabled the defenders to withstand a considerable attack for enough time to allow the Portuguese to mobilize a relief army in Estremoz, firstly under André de Albuquerque and later under António Luís de Meneses, Count of Cantanhede. On 17 January, around 8 o'clock in the morning, the Portuguese attacked the Spanish in their trenches. The battle was undecided in its initial stages, as the Duke of San Germán and other Spanish generals {{made every effort to}} collect their troops and recover the lost ground, but after some time, the Portuguese forces of Cantanhede managed to break the lines and the Spanish retreated to Badajoz with great loss: from the initial army of 17, 500 men, only 5,000 infantry men plus 1,300 horsemen managed to reach Badajoz, and all the artillery together with 5,000 men, 15,000 firearms, luggage and correspondence, were captured. The Portuguese army again besieged Badajoz shortly after, bringing events in the region <b>full</b> <b>circle,</b> but failed once again to take the city. By then, the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees had ended Spains's war with France and the recovery of Portugal had become the main objective of Philip IV.|$|E
