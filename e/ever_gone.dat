5|$|For his 239-yard, one {{touchdown}} passing performance, Greg McElroy {{was named the}} game's MVP. Ingram rushed for 113 and Trent Richardson rushed for 80 yards. The victory gave Alabama its 22nd SEC title, their third {{since the inception of}} the Championship Game and their first in ten years—the longest time the Crimson Tide program has <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> without an SEC championship. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 20–14 (21–14 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory). Alabama earned their third SEC championship since the inception of the SEC Championship Game in 1992, and their 22nd SEC title.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the early}} exit in the Houston Regional {{due to the}} upset by the Aggies, Humber {{looked forward to the}} Major League Baseball Draft. Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> so early in the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Murray next competed at the Madrid Open and {{following}} his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player Elena Baltacha. He then lost to qualifier Santiago Giraldo {{in the following}} round. Murray then reached {{the quarterfinals of the}} Rome Masters where he lost to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a tight match in which he had been up a break in the final set. At the French Open, Murray defeated Andrey Golubev and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12–10 in the final set. This was the first time Murray had <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> beyond 7–5 in a deciding set. He followed this up with a straight sets win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gaël Monfils in the quarterfinal, which saw Murray rise to world No. 5 and equal his best ever French Open by reaching the semifinals. However, he subsequently lost to Nadal in straight sets, winning only 6 games in the match. After losing the 2014 French Open semifinals to Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world No. 1, and two-times slam titlist, Amélie Mauresmo as his coach in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.|$|E

5|$|Since postseason games cannot {{end in a}} tie, {{unlike the}} preseason or regular season, {{additional}} overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined. Furthermore, all clock rules apply as if a game had started over. Therefore, if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied, the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime. If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime, {{there would be a}} two-minute warning (but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season). And if it were still tied at the end of double overtime, there would be a kickoff to start triple overtime. Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely, or last multiple overtime periods like several National Hockey League postseason games, no NFL playoff game has <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> into triple-overtime. The longest NFL game played to date is 82 minutes, 40 seconds: Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of double-overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 27–24, in the 1971–72 NFL playoffs on December 25, 1971.|$|E

In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Palaeozoic era, and to claim that no order of plants had <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> extinct.|$|E

However much of the radio audience may have remained unaware that the Maxwell was <b>ever</b> <b>gone,</b> because before long Jack was heard traveling around in a decrepit old car again, {{and by the end}} of the 1940s his car would once more be specifically identified as a Maxwell.|$|E

25|$|The Metrodome {{will also}} be remembered in NFL history {{as the site of}} four of the longest NFL {{touchdown}}s in history in terms of yardage. From scrimmage, only 14 plays have <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> the maximum 99 yards for a touchdown in league history. The lone run in that list is by Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett against the Vikings on January 3, 1983 during a Monday Night Football game. One of the 13 such pass plays is Vikings quarterback Gus Frerotte's connection with receiver Bernard Berrian during a game against the Chicago Bears on November 30, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The Progressive Conservative {{government}} of the time, headed by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, did not accept the invitation {{to establish a new}} Canadian flag, so Pearson made it Liberal Party policy in 1961, and part of the party's election platform in the 1962 and 1963 federal elections. During the election campaign of 1963, Pearson promised that Canada would have a new flag within two years of his election. No previous party leader had <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> as far as Pearson did, by putting a time limit on finding a new national flag for Canada. The 1963 election brought the Liberals back to power, but with a minority government. In February 1964, a three-leaf design was leaked to the press.|$|E
25|$|The World Series in 1991 is {{regarded}} {{by many as}} one of the classics of all time. In this Series, four games were won during the teams' final at-bat, and three of these were in extra innings. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. The sixth game was a legendary one for Puckett, who tripled in a run, made a sensational leaping catch against the wall, and finally in the 11th inning hit the game-winning home run. The seventh game was tied 0–0 after the regulation nine innings, and marked only the second time that the seventh game of the World Series had <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> into extra innings. The Twins won on a walk-off RBI single by Gene Larkin {{in the bottom of the}} 10th inning, after Morris had pitched ten shutout innings against the Braves. The seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded {{as one of the}} greatest games in the history of professional baseball.|$|E
25|$|Roddick {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Aegon Championships, {{where he was a}} four-time champion. In the semifinals, he played Andy Murray, their first meeting since the Wimbledon 2009 semifinals, but Roddick was defeated in straight sets. Roddick was seeded eighth for Wimbledon, and in the first round, he beat Andreas Beck of Germany in straight sets. In the second round, Roddick defeated Victor Hănescu, again in straight sets. In the third round, Roddick was beaten in straight sets by left-handed Spaniard Feliciano López. The upset loss to Lopez meant that Roddick failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam since the 2010 Australian open. This was the longest Roddick had <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> in his career without reaching the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam. In the Davis Cup quarterfinals match against Spain, Roddick drew David Ferrer first, but lost in three tight sets. Roddick was supposed to play Feliciano López in reverse singles, but after David Ferrer wrapped up the victory for Spain by defeating Mardy Fish, their match was cancelled.|$|E

500|$|From {{his early}} days, Auerbach was {{convinced}} that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> {{out of his way to}} achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics." ...|$|E

The triumphal raising of the True Cross in the Hagia Sophia was a crowning moment in his achievements. Had Heraclius died then, {{he would have been}} recorded in history, {{in the words of the}} historian Norman Davies, as [...] "the greatest Roman general since Julius Caesar". Instead, he lived through the Arab invasions, losing battle after battle against their onslaught and tarnishing his reputation for victory. John Norwich succinctly described Heraclius as having [...] "lived too long".|$|E

Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|Star Cops was {{broadcast}} on Monday nights at around 8:30pm starting on 6 July 1987 on BBC2. Competition was provided on BBC One by sitcom Terry and June and The Nine O'Clock News. The fifth episode, [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years", {{was broadcast}} at the later time of 9.55pm. The BBC listings magazine Radio Times promoted the series, {{giving it the}} front cover of the 4–10 July 1987 edition accompanied by a four-page article by Johnny Black inside. Star Cops performed poorly in the ratings with an average audience across the series of only 2.2million viewers. Chris Boucher has blamed the poor ratings on the timeslot the show was given, stating: [...] "There is nothing that has <b>ever</b> <b>gone</b> out on BBC 2 at half-past eight until twenty-past nine; it's a grotesque period. It doesn't synch with anything on BBC 1; it just doesn't work in relation to anything. You had to badly want to see Star Cops in order to watch it because you had to sacrifice {{at least two hours}} of viewing to see it. I can see why people didn't want to have that problem.". He has also commented that the poor timeslot and the decision to air the series in July and August (a time when viewing figures are traditionally lower due to the summer) reflected the fact that Star Cops didn't have the confidence of the BBC management. This view is echoed by star David Calder who has described the timeslot as [...] "an act of sabotage and absurdity".|$|E
