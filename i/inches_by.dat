5|$|The {{upper floor}} also {{contains}} the India Silk Bedroom and the Ante Room, which measures 23ft 4 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 32ft 6 inches. Formerly {{known as the}} Patchwork Bedroom, the Ante Room was established by Charlotte, Countess Spencer and her sister during the Victorian period, and today forms part of a suite of state chambers.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E

5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp’s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed {{over a number of}} years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is 6 feet 4 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the wicket changed several times until the current 28 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> nine inches was agreed in 1931 and confirmed in 1947. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, the two-stump wicket then in use {{is believed to have been}} 22 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> six inches.|$|E

25|$|Butterfly Lodge is a {{five and}} half room log cabin, {{originally}} constructed as a hunting lodge in 1913 for the author, James Willard Schultz. Originally a rectangular building measuring 18 feet by 24 feet, {{it has been}} expanded {{over the years and}} now covers 40 feet, 10 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 32 feet, 6 inches, the shorter side being the front of the cabin. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1992.|$|E
25|$|While in Paris, Kelly had {{continued}} to paint the figure but by May 1949, {{he made his first}} abstract paintings. Observing how light dispersed on the surface of water, he painted Seine (1950), made of black and white rectangles arranged by chance. In 1951 he started a series of eight collages titled Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance I to VIII. He created it by using numbered slips of paper; each referred to a colour, one of eighteen different hues to be placed on a grid 40 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 40 inches. Each of the eight collages employed a different process.|$|E

25|$|The high-wheeler {{lives on}} in the gear inch units used by cyclists in English-speaking {{countries}} to describe gear ratios. These are calculated by multiplying the wheel diameter in <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> the number of teeth on the front chain-wheel and dividing by the teeth on the rear sprocket. The result is the equivalent diameter of a penny-farthing wheel. A 60-inch gear, the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler, is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle, while top gears on many exceed 100inches. There {{was at least one}} 64-inch Columbia made in the mid-1880s, but 60 was the largest in regular production.|$|E
25|$|The Fortissimo emerged {{two years}} prior to the filing of the {{influential}} and lucrative patent for racquets sized 95-135 square <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> Prince Sporting Goods (now Prince Sports and commonly called Prince). This resulted in the disqualification of the patent by the German patent authority. The Prince patent was upheld elsewhere and the company became the only highly successful seller of oversize racquets in their early history. The first was the very flexible aluminum Prince Classic of 1976. Tad Weed introduced the first super-oversize in 1975, to start a line that continues to be sold today.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} {{radiator}} was lowered 2 inches from the One-o-Four's. The styling of the Majestic is similar to, but wider and with smoother lines than the short lived Regency One-O-Four model it replaced. Interior width was increased by approximately 4 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> extending the sides {{to the edge of}} the car. The handsome body is massive with a conventional high waistline —the doors later seemed to be high with narrow windows— and a rounded rear window. There are two standard-sized headlamps at the front extremities with Daimler's usual pair of fog lamps or driving lights just above low-set bumpers. There are plain disc wheels.|$|E

25|$|The cabin {{consists}} of 5 and half rooms, of logs with plank and slab construction. Originally it covered 18 feet by 24 feet, {{but has been}} expanded with three additions during the 1920s and 1930s, and now covers 40 feet, 10 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 32 feet, 6 inches, the shorter side being {{the front of the}} cabin, which lies to the southwest of the building. There was a fireplace on the east end of the structure. The logs were hewn on three sides, leaving the bark on the fourth side to serve as exterior facing, as well as their corners having a double saddle notch in the corners of the building. The logs were procured from the Isaacson Saw Mill, which was located not far away on Benny Creek.|$|E
25|$|All {{the later}} Commission tablets used {{a design that}} {{differed}} from the prototype tablet in that it brought together elements from all the dominions and India. This standard design, following consultations with the College of Arms, had the Royal Coat of Arms surrounded by the shields of the coats of arms of the five Dominions: the Union of South Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Dominion of Canada and the Dominion of Newfoundland. The Indian Empire was represented by the insignia of the Order of the Star of India and its motto 'Heaven's light our guide'. Some designs of the tablet referred to 'The United Kingdom', while others referred to 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'. The text within the main design includes the mottoes used in the Royal Coat of Arms: Honi soit qui mal y pense and Dieu et mon droit. The material used was gilded and coloured gesso set in a stone surround. Other design elements included a banded laurel-like border with carved roses in each corner and one at bottom centre. Some designs differed in {{the placement of the}} names of the dominions, and some varied in the colours used. The Westminster tablet is 5 feet 10 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 2 feet 10 inches (177.8cm by 86.36cm). The Ypres tablet is 266cm by 127cm.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the ponds are relics of the [...] "2 fisheries" [...] mentioned in the Domesday Book entry for the site. The gardens and salmon pool were the subject of an oil painting by the neo-classical painter Adam Buck; the painting, measuring 35 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 57 inches, sold at auction at Sotheby's in London for £3,200 on 27 November 1974. Some of Capability Brown's signature cedars of Lebanon still surround the house today.|$|E

The nave {{measures}} about 24feet 9 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 23feet 6inches (about 7.5m by 7.2m); the chancel is about 23feet 3inches by 18feet 9inches (about 7.1m by 5.7m).

500|$|The Nine Stones circle {{has been}} {{described}} by Gale as [...] "probably the most well documented of all those surviving in the county". It measures 9.1 metres by 7.9 metres (29 feet 10 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 25 feet 11 inches) in diameter, as measured from a north-to-south direction. The stones are of sarsen or conglomerate. A gap between two stones {{on the side of the}} circle adjacent to the road may suggest that there was once a tenth stone in the monument. Given its dimensions, the circle could only accommodate a small number of individuals assembling within it.|$|E
500|$|In August 1957, {{the local}} farmer W. G. Best was {{ploughing}} on his Brenscombe Farm when he uncovered {{a row of}} 23 stones that was situated about [...] west of Rempstone Stone Circle. His son stood most of these into an upright position, to better assist their later removal. The antiquarian J. Bernard Calkin was alerted to the discovery and visited it prior to the stones being removed by the farmer. Calkin noted that the stones were made of local sandstone and were smaller than the stones in the circle, averaging about 2 feet 6 <b>inches</b> <b>by</b> 1 foot 6 inches. He believed {{that they had been}} deliberately lain out in two parallel lines, 3 yards apart and with an interval of five yards between each stone.|$|E

The flatiron dropped down over {{the tail of the}} shoal, exactly where the buoy had been, and backed once before Bai-Jove-Judson was satisfied. Then they went up stream for half an hour, put into shoal water by the bank and waited, with a slip-rope on the anchor.|$|R
