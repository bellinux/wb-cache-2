40|$|A {{rural area}} {{power supply system}} (RAPSS) which {{produces}} charcoal as a by-product for use elsewhere through the gasification of biomass fuels is modeled. The power generation system utilizes a conventionally-fueled engine-generator combination to produce electricity for local use. The energy needed for the gasification process is obtained from the exhaust gases from an internal combustion (IC) engine, which could be a petrol engine, a diesel engine or a gas engine. In this particular model, a diesel <b>engine-generator</b> <b>system</b> is specifically used. The charcoal production system being modeled is a small-scale system, producing between 20 and 60 kg of charcoal per hour, with the diesel engine running at its rated capacity. The special features and constraints which govern such a system operating in a rural environment of a developing country are addressed, followed by {{a study of the}} rate of charcoal production from a given system, using thermodynamic relationships. The key features of such a system include reliability, simplicity of operation, robustness, operation by local personnel and a level of technology appropriate to the location of the system...|$|E
40|$|In this Mechanical Engineering senior project, {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) systems were evaluated {{based on their}} effectiveness in supplying the energy requirements of a planned building on the Carnegie Mellon University campus. Initial feasibility studies found that three system types could potentially meet the energy needs of the building in a cost-effective manner: a diesel <b>engine-generator</b> <b>system</b> with heat recovery exchangers, a gas microturbine with an exhaust gas boiler, and a high temperature fuel cell with heat recovery exchangers. Using engineering equation solver (EES) software, the thermodynamics of each system was modeled to assess its useful thermal output for different system sizes. The thermodynamic analysis determined the necessary system size needed to meet the predicted maximum thermal load of the building. The required system sizes are (reported as maximum electrical power output) : two 115 kW diesel engine-generator sets, a 250 kW microturbine, or two 250 kW high temperature fuel cells. After sizing the systems, a cash flow analysis model was constructed to evaluate each system under varying assumptions regarding utility rates, fuel costs, and renewable energy incentiv...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{batteries}} {{are limited by}} low gravimetric &amp; volumetric energy density (ED) and not suitable for scaling. Studies of MEMS micro-engine coupled generator power supplies for portable applications are undertaken by many research institutes to develop an alternative to electrochemical batteries. Micro systems that {{have been reported in}} the current literature produce output power in the range of 100 µW to 1 mW at rotor speeds of 30, 000 to 100, 000 rpm, but challenges and issues still remain in the area of engine and generator development to overcome low system efficiency and low energy density. The main contributions of the thesis are in the areas of thin micro generator development suitable for planar MEMS technologies which can be integrated with micro combustion engines. The development of a thin MEMS axial generator topology to achieve high power density is presented in the thesis. A customized lumped parameter analysis methodology using parametric equations is developed to select suitable parameters for the MEMS Micro generator. The methodology takes inputs from magnetic circuit and planar coil analysis used in the thesis. The magnetic circuit analysis is done using a Permeance coefficient method to determine air gap flux density (Bg), force and torque. The planar coil analysis is performed using an original analytical method to determine winding parameters like resistance, coil length, and no of coils to operate the system within practical current density and current loading level. ANSYS FEA analysis is used to validate the theoretical method prediction of air gap flux density for the 5 mm rotor radius micro generator model which showed accuracies of 93 % to FEA prediction. Equivalent circuit model of the micro generator with the selected parameters is developed for characterisation. The equivalent resistance and reactance of the equivalent circuit model is found to be 573 KΩ and 489 Ω respectively. Characterisation for no load, full load and variable load is performed and an estimated useful power output of 1. 6 mW is achievable at 15000 rpm. The micro generator when operated at an increasing temperature of 100 oC would see reduction in O/P power from 1. 6. mW to 1. 3 mW due to temperature effect on both flux density at air gap and winding resistance. Generalised equations for the engine are derived and linked to the micro generator lumped parameter equations to form the analysis model for integrated <b>engine-generator</b> <b>system.</b> The model was analysed for attainable energy density for a system volume of 40 e- 3 * 70 e- 3 * 5 e- 3 mm. The estimated energy density from the analysis was 42. 3 WH/Kg. This estimated energy density is three times the energy density that could be achievable from existing micro generators for the same volume. A small improvement in engine efficiency of 3 - 5 % is believed to increase the energy density of the module closer or higher than existing batteries. The capacity of the micro engine –generator system to be able to operate for 3. 9 hours at 1. 6 mW output power would still make this system a significant alternative source of power for portable applications with a huge scope for further improvemen...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} use of gas turbine (GT) engine integrated solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to reduce fuel burn in aircraft with large electrical loads like sensor-laden unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The concept offers a number of advantages: the GT absorbs many SOFC balance of plant functions (supplying fuel, air, and heat to the fuel cell) thereby {{reducing the number of}} components in the system; the GT supplies fuel and pressurized air that significantly increases SOFC performance; heat and unreacted fuel from the SOFC are recaptured by the GT cycle offsetting system-level losses; good transient response of the GT cycle compensates for poor transient response of the SOFC. The net result is a system that can supply more electrical power more efficiently than comparable <b>engine-generator</b> <b>systems</b> with only modest (3 in some cases) than generator-based systems before encountering turbine inlet temperature limits. Aerodynamic drag effects of engine-airframe integration are by far the most important limiter of the combined propulsion/electrical generation concept. However, up to 100 - 200 kW can be produced in a bypass ratio = 8, overall pressure ratio = 40 turbofan with little or no drag penalty. This study shows {{that it is possible to}} create cooperatively integrated GT-SOFC systems for combined propulsion and power with better overall performance than stand-alone components...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Hot {{engine exhaust}} and {{industrial}} process exhaust represents a resource {{that is often}} rejected to the environment without further utilization. This resource is prevalent in the transportation and industrial process sectors, but stationary <b>engine-generator</b> <b>systems</b> also typically do not utilize this resource. Engine exhaust is considered high grade heat and can potentially be utilized by various approaches to produce electricity or to drive heating and cooling systems. This thesis describes {{a model system that}} employs thermoelectric conversion as a topping cycle integrated with an organic Rankine bottoming cycle for waste heat utilization. This approach is being developed to fully utilize the thermal energy contained in hot exhaust streams. This thesis investigates several system configurations each composed of a high temperature heat exchanger which extracts thermal energy for driving the thermoelectric conversion elements and a closely integrated bottoming cycle to capture the large amount of remaining thermal energy in the exhaust stream. The models differ by how they arrange specific heat exchangers in the system. Many interacting parameters that define combined system operation are employed in the models to determine overall system performance including output power, efficiency, and total energy utilization factors. In addition, the model identifies a maximum power operating point for the combined system. That is, the model can identify the optimal amount of heat to remove from the exhaust flow to drive the thermoelectric elements for maximizing the combined cycle output. The model has been developed such that the impact of heat exchanger UA[subscript h] values, thermal resistances, and the thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) can be investigated in the context of system operation. The model also has the ability to simultaneously determine the effect of each cycle design parameter on the performance of the overall system, thus giving the ability to utilize as much waste heat as possible. Key analysis results are presented showing the impact of critical design parameters on power output, system performance and inter-relationships between design parameters in governing performance...|$|R
40|$|The Iowa Methodist Medical Center of Des Moines, Iowa, is {{installing}} two 1, 500 kW Fairbanks-Morse turbocharged dual-fuel reciprocating <b>engine-generators.</b> The <b>system</b> will {{be installed}} with recovery of exhaust waste heat as steam and jacket, lube oil, and intercooler waste heat as hot water. During periods of high steam demand, the waste heat boilers will be supplementally fired for additional steam production. The paper {{will present the}} feasibility study, predesign report, and detailed design results. Both gas turbines and reciprocating engines in numerous configurations were considered. Sensitivity to breakdown, capital costs, and varying escalation rates were investigated. The conclusion was that reciprocating engines would meet the payback requirements with an acceptable level of risk. To further reduce the risk, a bid package for the engines was prepared during predesign. Upon selection of the engines, {{a major portion of}} the project cost was firmly established and final design was authorized. Scheduled completion is February, 1987...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of a biogas-fueled, <b>engine-generator</b> cogeneration <b>system</b> into a farrow-to-finish swine operation is investigated. The design basis and justification for {{selection of the}} size and type of components comprising the engine-generator set and the thermal energy storage and utilization system is presented. The cogeneration system was installed on the University of Nebraska Energy Integrated Farm. ^ A model simulating the cogeneration system and farm electrical and hot water demands is developed to investigate the {{integration of}} the cogenerator into the daily operation of the farm. The model is written in a hierarchical approach such that subroutines can be modified or replaced to allow analysis of other cogeneration systems. Data was collected on the operation of the cogeneration system and the energy demands of the energy integrated farm. This data is used to validate the assumptions and modeling procedures used. ^ Strategies of starting and operating the cogenerator, based on electrical demand, hot water demand, and biogas availability setpoints for summer, fall, and winter conditions are compared and evaluated using the model. A sensitivity analysis is conducted using winter conditions to indicate the effect of electrical demand setpoints and the constraint of minimum cogenerator operating time on the performance of the cogeneration system. ^ The results of the model are compared by criteria including the frequency of cogenerator starting and the degree in which digester and space heating demands are met. An economic approach was also formulated to evaluate the results. This formulation involves representing the performance of a strategy by the percentage of cogenerated electricity sold to the utility (F(,E)) and the percentage of cogenerated thermal energy dissipated by the cogenerator radiator (F(,Q)). The economic results are presented in a general manner to allow comparison to other values of F(,E), F(,Q), and electricity and fossil fuel rates than those used for illustration. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} {{power is}} paramount {{and loss of}} power to communication equipment can mean loss of service to customers and loss {{of millions of dollars}} to companies. When the grid power is unavailable in remote areas there are variety of back-up electrical power systems like valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) battery <b>systems,</b> <b>engine-generator</b> sets, ultra capacitors, flywheels, and new battery technologies that strive to provide back-up power. Hydrogen Energy and fuel cell technology compete with traditional technologies meeting back-up power requirements in stationary applications. Recent collaboration between Victoria University, Sustainable Energy Fuel Cells Australia (SEFCA) and Acta Energy has resulted in thorough laboratory testing for H 2 generation and data compilation of fuel cells in a back-up power operation in Power Systems Research Laboratory at Victoria University. The authors of this paper suggests that the use of EL 100 H 2 generator and T- 1000 1. 2 kW PEMFC Power Generation System is capable to compete with traditional technologies to offer back-up power when there is no base load or PV or wind power. This paper presents the planning of laboratory testing, analysis and evaluation of the laboratory results. This paper also highlights the benefits of PEMFC system, EL 100 H 2 generator and ReliOn's T- 1000 PEMFC system. Currently it is expensive to run distance trucks requiring several site visits per year in order to refill the diesel or even carrying H 2 bottles to a rural site. This system generates H 2 on-site and can be implemented as a back-up power in telecommunication system like the Australian National Broadband Network (NBN) where there will be need for reliable back-up power supply since NBN will be rolling out several hundred points of presence (POP's) ...|$|R
