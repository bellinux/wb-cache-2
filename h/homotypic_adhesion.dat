We studied {{the effects of}} three CD 43 antibodies (6 E 5, 6 F 5 and 10 G 7) on human neutrophils and found that all three monoclonal antibodies (mAb) induced significant <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> involving more than 50 % of cells. Monovalent Fab fragments of CD 43 mAb had no such effect but became equally effective upon cross-linkage with F(ab') 2 sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies. The <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> induced by CD 43 antibodies was dependent on divalent cations, energy, temperature and an intact cytoskeleton, but not on de novo protein synthesis. <b>Homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> could be inhibited by mAb to CD 11 b, CD 18 and CD 54, indicating an involvement of the beta 2 integrin cyto-adhesion pathway. Additionally, oxidative burst formation was observed with intact CD 43 mAb. No such effect was seen with monomeric or cross-linked Fab fragments. This, together with the observation that burst formation unlike adhesion induction could be completely abolished with Fc gamma RII, but not with Fc gamma RIII antibody fragments, suggests that in burst induction, heterologous cross-linkage with Fc gamma RII is involved. A Ca 2 + increase with CD 43 antibodies was not detectable. Adhesion induction was unaffected by H 7, chelerythrin, staurosporine or lavendustin A, but was completely ablated by sphingosine and herbimycin A.

40|$|The {{leukocyte}} integrin LFA- 1 (CD 11 a/CD 18) plays a {{key role}} in many adhesive interactions involving cells of the immune system. Recently, it has been shown that LFA- 1 is not only involved in cell adhesion, but that stimulation of LFA- 1 can also contribute to cell activation. We now demonstrate that triggering of LFA- 1 on T lymphocytes by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the LFA- 1 alpha chain, but not against the LFA- 1 beta chain, promotes cell adhesion. Induction of <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> was only observed in T cells that had been pre-activated with anti-CD 3 and not in resting peripheral blood T lymphocytes.

The sensitivity of LFA- 1 alpha-induced adhesion to H 7, which prevents the activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase A, and to cytochalasin B, which inhibits microfilament formation, suggests that the activation of the LFA- 1 pathway through the LFA- 1 alpha chain involves cell activation and requires an intact cytoskeleto...|$|E

Consistent with this hypothesis, Erk activation by 5 (S) -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5 -HETE; lipoxygenase-independent metabolite of 5 -HpETE) was also pertussis toxin sensitive. These data suggest that a 5 -lipoxygenase metabolite of AA, e. g., 5 -HETE, is released from AA-treated cells to engage a plasma membrane-associated, pertussis toxin-sensitive, G protein-linked receptor, leading to activation of Erk and adhesion via the Raf- 1 /Mek signal transduction pathway...|$|E

These results suggest that cadherin 6 B is a novel molecular marker for vascular and visceral SMC phenotypes and is involved in the late differentiation of SMCs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> of {{neutrophils}} stimulated with chemoattractant {{is analogous}} to capture on vascular endothelium in that both processes depend on L-selectin and β 2 -integrin adhesion receptors. Under hydrodynamic shear, cell adhesion requires that receptors bind sufficient ligand over the duration of intercellular contact to withstand hydrodynamic stresses. A detailed examination {{of the effect of}} shear rate and shear stress on neutrophil-neutrophil adhesion was performed using cone plate viscometry. A collisional analysis based on Smoluchowski's theory was employed to fit the kinetics of aggregation with an adhesion efficiency. Adhesion efficiency increased with shear rate from ∼ 20...|$|E
40|$|A latent {{infection}} membrane protein (LMP) encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in latently infected, growth-transformed lymphocytes alters the phenotype {{of a human}} EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell line (Louckes) when introduced by gene transfer. These LMP-expressing cells exhibit increased <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> due to increased expression of the adhesion molecules LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1. Increased <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> could foster B-cell growth by facilitating autocrine growth factor effects. LFA- 3 expression is also induced. The induction of LFA- 3 and ICAM- 1 results in increased heterotypic adhesion to T lymphocytes. This could result in more effective T-cell immune surveillance. Since LMP is expressed in EBV-transformed lymphocytes and has been demonstrated to transform rodent fibroblasts in vitro, {{a wide range of}} possible effects on B-lymphoma cell growth were assayed. In the Louckes B-lymphoma cell line, EBV LMP causes increased cell size, acid production, plasma membrane ruffling, and villous projections. Although cell proliferation rate was not greatly affected, the steady-state intracellular free calcium level, transforming growth factor beta responsiveness, and expression of the lymphocyte activation markers (CD 23 and transferrin receptor) were increased. Thus, LMP appears to be a mediator of EBV effects on B-cell transformation. In transfected lymphoma cells, LMP localizes to patches at the cell periphery and associates with the cytoskeleton as it does in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes or in rodent fibroblasts. A partially deleted form of LMP (D 1 LMP) does not aggregate in patches or associate with the cytoskeleton and had little effect on B-cell growth. Thus, cytoskeletal association may be integral to LMP activity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} the immunobiology {{of the interaction}} of intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM- 3; CD 50) with its counter- receptor, leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1; CD 11 a/CD 18). Purified ICAM- 3 supported LFA- 1 -dependent adhesion in a temperature- and cation-dependent manner. Activation of cells bearing LFA- 1 increased adhesiveness for ICAM- 3 in parallel to adhesiveness for ICAM- 1. Although CBR-IC 3 / 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) blocked adhesion of cells to purified LFA- 1, when tested alone, neither CBR-IC 3 / 1 nor five novel ICAM- 3 mAbs characterized here blocked adhesion of cells to purified ICAM- 3 or <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Two ICAM- 3 mAbs, CBR-IC 3 / 1 and CBR-IC 3 / 2, were required to block LFA- 1 -dependent adhesion to purified ICAM- 3 - or LFA- 1 -dependent, ICAM- 1 -, ICAM- 2 -independent <b>homotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> of lymphoid cell lines. Two ICAM- 3 mAbs, CBR-IC 3 / 1 and CBR- IC 3 / 6, induced LFA- 1 -independent aggregation that was temperature and divalent cation dependent and was completely inhibited by ICAM- 3 mAb, CBR-IC 3 / 2, recognizing a distinct epitope. Purified ICAM- 3 provided a costimulatory signal for proliferation of resting T lymphocytes. mAb to ICAM- 3, together with mAbs to ICAM- 1 and ICAM- 2, inhibited peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin, allogeneic stimulator cells, and specific antigen. Inhibition was almost complete and to {{the same level as}} with mAb to LFA- 1, suggesting the most functionally important, and possibly all, of the ligands for LFA- 1 have been defined...|$|E
50|$|EpCAM {{may also}} play a role in {{epithelial}} mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumors, although its exact effects are poorly understood. Its ability to suppress E-cadherin suggests that EpCAM would promote EMT and tumor metastasis, but its <b>homotypic</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> properties can counteract its ability to suppress E-cadherin. Results from different studies are often conflicting. In one study, for example, silencing of EpCAM with short interfering RNA (siRNA) led to a reduction of proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro supporting the role of EpCAM in promoting EMT. In another study, cells undergoing EMT were found to downregulate EpCAM. In one study, epithelial tumors were often strongly positive for EpCAM, but mesenchymal tumors showed only occasional and weak positivity. It has been suggested that EpCAM expression is downregulated during EMT but then upregulated once the metastasis reaches its future tumor site.|$|R
40|$|Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), an {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) superfamily member, {{functions as}} an adhesion molecule in vitro. This thesis reports that nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), a CEA family member, can mediate Ca$ sp{++}$-independent, <b>homotypic</b> intercellular <b>adhesion</b> in vitro. Heterotypic adhesion studies demonstrate that CEA can cross-interact with NCA; however, neither NCA nor CEA can {{interact with other}} Ig superfamily members such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and myelin-associated glycoprotein. This specificity was used to investigate the mechanism of CEA-CEA binding using CEA truncated and CEA/NCAM chimeric constructs. A novel model has been proposed in which double reciprocal interactions between the V-like domains and C-like domains of antiparallel CEA molecules result in strong binding between CEA on apposing cell surfaces. Furthermore, the specificity of a library of anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies was defined; their effects on CEA-mediated adhesion further support the CEA-binding model...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{evaluated}} the potential antineoplastic effects of α-mangostin (α-M), the most representative xanthone in Garcinia mangostana pericarp, on melanoma cell lines. This xanthone markedly inhibits {{the proliferation of}} high-metastatic B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, by deeply analyzing which steps in the metastatic process are influenced by xanthone {{it was observed that}} α-M strongly interferes with <b>homotypic</b> aggregation, <b>adhesion,</b> plasticity and invasion ability of B 16 -F 10 cells, probably by the observed reduction of metalloproteinase- 9 activity. The antiproliferative and antimetastatic properties of α-M have been established in human SK-MEL- 28 and A 375 melanoma cells. In order to identify pathways potentially involved in the antineoplastic properties of α-M, a comparative mass spectrometry proteomic approach was employed. These findings may improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of α-M on melanoma...|$|R
