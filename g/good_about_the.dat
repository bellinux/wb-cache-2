S. Eliot's arch cut up work, The Wasteland. [...] " [...] "What's so <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>The</b> JAMs", the magazine said, [...] "is the way they are capturing on disc the whole social and musical confusion and instability of 1987 Britain".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Metro Silicon Valley, Pete Postlethwaite quoted Bryan Singer as saying that all the characters are Söze. When asked point blank whether his character is Söze, Postlethwaite said, [...] "Who knows? Nobody knows. That's what's <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>The</b> Usual Suspects." [...] Spacey has also been evasive about his character's true identity. In {{an interview}} with Total Film, he said, [...] "That's for the audience to decide. My job is {{to show up and}} do a part – I don't own the audience's imagination." [...] Singer said the film is ambiguous about most of the character's details, but the fax sent {{at the end of the}} film proves in his mind that Kint is Söze.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{environmental}} {{focus was}} also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of The American Spectator wrote {{that it is}} [...] "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens". Braile agrees that the book could be [...] "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a [...] "Jeremiad" [...] ultimately gave it a positive review. The Guardian says [...] "we learn {{during the course of}} this book, to feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disappearance of humanity from the Earth".|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the Beatles, Radiohead {{tried to}} keep the songs succinct. The opening track, [...] "2 + 2 = 5", was {{initially}} recorded as a studio test, and was finished in two hours. Radiohead struggled to record [...] "There There"; after rerecording it in their Oxfordshire studio, Yorke was so relieved to have captured the song he wept, feeling it was the band's best work. Radiohead had attempted to record an electronic version of [...] "I Will" [...] in the Kid A and Amnesiac sessions, but abandoned it as [...] "dodgy Kraftwerk"; instead they used components of this recording to create [...] "Like Spinning Plates" [...] on Amnesiac. For Hail to the Thief, the band sought to [...] "get to the core of what's <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song" [...] and not be distracted by production details or new sounds, settling on a stripped-back arrangement.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Warner Bros., {{feeling the}} film had become {{relevant}} again {{due to the}} Iraq War, decided to re-release it in theaters and on DVD. Having no additional footage to add, Russell instead shot Soldiers Pay, a short documentary about the Iraq War, to accompany the film. Taking its name from William Faulkner's first novel {{of the same name}} about an airman's return home in World War I's aftermath, Russell said the documentary examined [...] "both sides of the war, people who feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> war, who believe in the mission, people who feel bad." ...|$|E

No matter how much money I made at it, I knew I didn't want to keep doing it. Frankly, when no one knows how you play, it's like putting a gun to someone's head. It wasn't a matter of whether you were going to win, but how much you were going to win, Early on, you make money everywhere you go. Then it all disappears."

2500|$|It was in 1921 that Gusman and {{his family}} moved to Moscow, where he began writing for Pravda. He was {{recognized}} as an important film critic, and from 1923 onwards headed Pravda's theatre section. Gusman rejected arguments among some Soviet filmmakers, associated with the Proletkult movement, that contributing to a new Soviet cinema required abandoning the history of film altogether. Gusman wrote that the new cinema [...] "must be built brick by brick, making use of everything that is healthy about the New World, and that which is <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> old." [...] Gusman responded favorably to candid films pioneered by Dziga Vertov called Kino-Pravda. He described them as [...] "lively… striking… and interesting," [...] but criticized the lack of connection between scenes and the absence of unifying themes.|$|E
2500|$|During {{depositions}} for the case, Trump told {{attorneys in}} December 2007, [...] "My net worth fluctuates, {{and it goes}} {{up and down with}} markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings." [...] Trump clarified, [...] "Yes, even my own feelings as to where the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day. Then you have a September 11th, and you don't feel so good about yourself and you don't feel so <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world and you don't feel so good about New York City. Then you have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after that it was a different feeling. So yeah, even my own feelings affect my value to myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Review {{aggregate}} site Metacritic {{was given}} a score of 55 out of 100 based on 59 critic reviews, indicating [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu praised the atmosphere and spectacle, but noted difficulties during combat and handling the camera. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh negatively referred to the game as [...] "Japanese fetish gaming in full effect", being satisfied with the gunplay and magic systems but finding most other aspects either poorly designed or lacking substance. GamePro was highly critical, faulting {{almost every aspect of}} the game's design, feeling that there was nothing <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game and that it was not worth buying despite a promising premise. Joe Juba of Game Informer felt that the game had potential and praised the enemy designs, but its poor execution held the game back from being a fully enjoyable experience.|$|E
