5|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the battle, the Spanish troops and local militia increased their pressure on Castellfollit's garrison. On 5 April, the Catalan miquelets, supported by five companies of dragoons and several peasants, defeated a party of French troops from Berga and Castellfollit, killing 60 soldiers and taking 200 prisoners. Noailles, then ill of rheumatism, ordered Lieutenant-general Saint-Sylvestre to assemble a supply convoy to relieve Castellfollit, which he put under an escort of 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. A corps of miquelets, Spanish dragoons and peasants led by Blai de Trinxeria attacked and defeated the convoy on 15 April. After that, the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric fell under an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade.</b> On 19 May, Saint-Sylvestre assembled an army of 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry and relieved Hostalric, but Castellfollit remained blockaded. Noailles and his second in command were not in good terms: if Saint-Sylvestre advocated for demolishing and abandoning both Hostalric and Castellfollit, Noailles was not willing to give ground.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1916, {{the first}} day of the Battle of the Somme, the British Army endured the bloodiest day in its history, {{suffering}} 57,470 casualties and 19,240 dead; nine Victoria Crosses were awarded for action on that day. Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men. The war was not just fought on land; the First World War saw major naval battles as well as the first large-scale use of military aircraft. The war at sea was mainly characterised by the efforts of the Allied Powers in blockading the Central Powers by sea. In return, the Central Powers attempted to break that blockade and establish an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> of the British Isles and France with U-boats and raiders. The largest naval battle of the First World War was the Battle of Jutland which was the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war. Four Victoria Crosses were awarded for action at Jutland. The war in the air saw 19 VCs being awarded to airmen. The First World War saw significant interest in flying aces, including the German Manfred von Richthofen—also known as The Red Baron—as well as British aces such as Albert Ball, Mick Mannock and Billy Bishop, who were all Victoria Cross recipients. Hostilities ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice Treaty in the Compiègne Forest, but the war was not officially over until the various peace treaties were signed in 1919. By the war's end, four major imperial powers – Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire—had been militarily and politically defeated, and the latter two ceased to exist as autonomous entities. Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilised from 1914–1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, Great Britain's Grand Fleet and Germany's Kaiserliche Marine {{faced each}} other in the North Sea, which became the main theatre of the war for surface action.

Major battles included the Battle of Heligoland Bight, the Battle of the Dogger Bank, and the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

In other words, {{in order to establish}} an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> in this part of North Carolina, the forts that the state had set up would have to be captured. Since the Navy could not do it alone, the cooperation of the Army would be needed.|$|E
25|$|In {{either case}} Theodoric and his Goths marched on Italy in 489 and waged war on Odovacar. Theodoric’s forces quickly forced Odovacar {{to flee to}} Ravenna and in short {{succession}} they captured both Verona and Milan. In Milan both secular and ecclesiastical leaders, as well as Odovacar’s commander-in-chief Tufa – though he would later betray Theodoric – {{and many of the}} defeated troops who joined Theodoric, welcomed him into the city {{as a representative of the}} emperor. In the summer of 490, with Odovacar back on the offensive, Alaric II of the Visigoths, in a rare moment of Gothic solidarity, sent troops to aid Theodoric in his efforts to remove Odovacar from power. Odoacer was forced to retreat once again into Ravenna, where Theodoric besieged him for two more years until Theodoric was finally able to gather the ships necessary to mount an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> of Ravenna, which could only be effectively attacked from the sea.|$|E

500|$|In January 1903, as the {{blockade}} continued during the negotiations, the German SMS Panther attempted {{to enter the}} lagoon of Maracaibo, a centre of German commercial activity. On 17 January it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting {{close enough to the}} fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the Vineta, with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January the Vineta bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town. [...] The action had not been approved by the British commander, who had been told by Admiralty after the incident of 13 December not to engage in such action without consulting London; the message was not passed to the German commander, who had been told previously to follow the British commander's lead. The incident caused [...] "considerable negative reaction in the United States against Germany"; the Germans said that the Venezuelans fired first, which the British concurred with but declared the bombardment [...] "unfortunate and inopportune" [...] nonetheless. The German Foreign Office said that the Panther's attempted incursion into the lagoon of Maracaibo had been motivated by a desire to ensure the <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> of Maracaibo, by preventing Maracaibo from being supplied across the adjacent Colombian border. Subsequently, Roosevelt informed the German Ambassador that Admiral Dewey had orders to be ready to sail to Venezuela from Puerto Rico at an hour's notice.|$|E

It was decided that with winter approaching, it was impracticable to maintain an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> of Navarino, and that in any event, {{the population of the}} Peloponnese had to be safeguarded. Although this was a highly provocative act, Codrington claimed that there was no intention to engage in battle, but only to make a show of force to induce the Ottomans to respect the armistice and to desist from atrocities against the civilian population.|$|E

2500|$|When {{communication}} {{was cut off}} with Washington {{at the start of}} the Civil War, Du Pont took the initiative of sending a fleet to the Chesapeake Bay to protect the landing of Union troops at Annapolis, Maryland. In June 1861 he was made president of a board in Washington formed to develop a plan of naval operations against the Confederacy. He was appointed flag officer serving aboard the steam frigate [...] as commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, leading from Norfolk, Virginia the largest fleet ever commanded by an American officer at that time. On November 7, Du Pont led a successful attack on the fortifications at Port Royal harbor in South Carolina. This victory enabled Union naval forces to secure the southern waters of Georgia and the entire eastern coast of Florida, and an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> was established.

2500|$|Hitler's [...] "Directive No. 17 – For {{the conduct}} of air and sea warfare against England" [...] issued on 1 August {{attempted}} to keep all the options open. The Luftwaffe's Adlertag campaign was to start around 5 August, subject to weather, {{with the aim of}} gaining air superiority over southern England as a necessary precondition of invasion, to give credibility to the threat and give Hitler the option of ordering the invasion. The intention was to incapacitate the RAF so much that the UK would feel open to air attack, and would begin peace negotiations. It was also to isolate the UK and damage war production, beginning an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade.</b> Following severe Luftwaffe losses, Hitler agreed at a 14 September OKW conference that the air campaign was to intensify regardless of invasion plans. On 16 September, Göring gave the order for this change in strategy, to the first independent strategic bombing campaign.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, however, Odoacer had to {{have lost}} all hope of victory.

On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an <b>effective</b> <b>blockade</b> of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theoderic and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule.
