5|$|The Golden State Warriors are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Oakland, California. The franchise {{had been known}} as the Philadelphia Warriors and the San Francisco Warriors, due to it previously being based in or near those cities. The team {{is a member of}} the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors initially joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, and won the first BAA championship title in the same year under coach Edward Gottlieb. The Warriors later joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26–42 in their first NBA season and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962–63 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The team became the Golden State Warriors and moved to Oakland before the 1971–72 NBA season.|$|E

The north end was remodeled into a caretaker's residence, although it had to be rebuilt to its original appearance after a fire destroyed it. Laura Hasbrouck died childless in 1964 and willed it to Richard Relyea Hasbrouck, a descendant of Maurice Hasbrouck's brother Huram, specifically to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family, since he had two sons already. He only found out when the estate's lawyer called and said he had to start paying taxes on the property.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time before}} 1765 the Crows held a Sun Dance, {{attended}} by a poor Arapaho. A Crow with power {{gave him a}} medicine doll, and he quickly earned status and owned horses as no one else. During the next Sun Dance, some Crows stole back the figure to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tribe. Eventually the Arapaho made a duplicate. Later in life, he married a Kiowa woman and brought the doll with him. The Kiowas use it during the Sun Dance and recognize {{it as one of}} the most powerful tribal medicines. They still credit the Crow tribe for the origin of their sacred Tai-may figure.|$|E
25|$|Vertebral subluxation, a core {{concept of}} {{traditional}} chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and {{a debate about}} whether to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades. In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, dogmatic beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community. This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an evidence-based chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.|$|E

Miranda is an anchoring protein that binds to Prospero and <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basal cortex. Following {{the generation of}} the GMC, Miranda releases Prospero and then becomes degraded. The segregation of Numb is mediated by Pon (the partner of Numb protein). Pon binds to Numb and colocalizes with it during neuroblast cell division.|$|R

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> current model, lac {{repressor}} {{is bound}} simultaneously {{to both the}} main operator O1 and to either O2 or O3. The intervening DNA loops out from the complex. The redundant nature of the two minor operators {{suggests that it is}} not a specific looped complex that is important. One idea is that the system works through tethering; if bound repressor releases from O1 momentarily, binding to a minor operator <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity, so that it may rebind quickly. This would increase the affinity of repressor for O1.|$|R
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Series Three was {{transmitted}} on Monday, 7 January 1980 at 7:15pm. Competition came from Coronation Street, game show Give Us a Clue and sitcom <b>Keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Family. Coverage of the Winter Olympics {{meant that the}} episode Children of Auron was shown on a Tuesday; the series returned to its regular time the following week. The series was watched {{by an average of}} 9.5million viewers. When the final episode, Terminal, was shown on 31 March 1980, the Blake's 7 production office had closed and the cast and crew had dispersed. They were surprised that, during the closing credits of Terminal, the continuity announcer declared that a new series of Blake's 7 would be shown the following year. The Head of BBC Television, Bill Cotton, was impressed by Terminal as he watched its broadcast at home. He telephoned BBC Presentation and instructed that an announcement be made during the end credits that the series would return.|$|E
25|$|After filming {{completed}} in June, Craven spent two months editing the final product, encountering repeated {{conflicts with the}} film rating body MPAA concerning the content of scenes, being forced to tone down or obscure the more intense scenes and violence to avoid an NC-17. Though Dimension Films had previously released NC-17 films, the rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience and thus they were desperate for a less restrictive R-rating. For an early scene involving {{the death of the}} character Casey Becker, Craven lied to the MPAA by claiming he had only one take of the scene and could not replace it with something less intense, in order to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. In interviews, Craven indicated that the conflict was enough that, at the time, he was considering leaving the horror genre. In total, Craven sent eight different cuts of the film to the MPAA before Bob Weinstein intervened and personally contacted the MPAA, believing they misunderstood to which genre Scream belonged. Weinstein explained to the organisation that although he agreed it was intense, it also had comedic elements and satirized its content and was not just a horror film glorifying violence. The MPAA reviewed their decision and granted the film an R-rating.|$|E

In 2012 La Pausa was {{withdrawn}} from sale by Sotheby's due to pending litigation. After the legal problems were resolved, Knight Frank put La Pausa up for sale in May 2013 for 40 million euros. In 2013 the French ambassador to Monaco, Hugues Moret, said of the sale that La Pausa was [...] "...part of France's heritage," [...] adding that [...] "We {{have to find a}} way to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family." ...|$|E
50|$|It is where, at the Czech Crown Inn, Czech author Jaroslav Hašek wrote a {{substantial}} part of The Good Soldier Švejk (books Two, Three, and Four) before he died in 1923, as he lodged there before buying a house across the street.

40|$|Two {{completely}} different directions of the oxidative transformation of methane (OTM) {{were performed on}} nickel-based catalysts due to the different acid-base properties of those catalysts. The relatively acidic LaNiOx and LiNiLaOx/Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibit excellent Partial Oxidation of Methane to Syngas (POM) performance. However, the relatively basic LiTiLaOx catalyst has a good Oxidative Coupling of Methane to C- 2 Hydrocarbons (OCM) activity. The basic properties of the catalyst {{makes it difficult to}} reduce nickel and <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oxidized state.

500|$|According to {{engineer}} Ryan Hewitt, the track contains [...] "four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing." [...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural ambience {{of the home}} it was recorded in. Upon playback of a rough mix of the song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song's conclusion, but mistakenly forgot {{to do the same}} for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had been listening to the Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final version of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the book was {{finished}} in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy [...] "chewing [...] way through the editing, {{which has been a}} surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around." [...] The hardest part of editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. [...] "However, as most any writer will tell you, just because you spent ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final manuscript. The only question that matters is whether the scene contributes to the book as a whole," [...] he said. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Alfred A. Knopf who worked with Paolini on Eragon and Eldest, assisted Paolini as the editor of Brisingr.|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of my mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of their heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
