The heat and hydrogen may allow nucleating thin nanodiamond from thin <b>few</b> <b>layer</b> graphene, but the magnetic fields of the lightning are important for stabilizing formation of larger diamond during such processes beyond the nanosize and thinnest. The easy of suspension of <b>few</b> <b>layer</b> graphene in such upper clouds in these planets and the nice electrical conduction path by such suspended graphene for subsequent multiple lightning strikes through the suspended graphene give more feasibility to this direct lightning driven diamond formation theory in the hydrogen atmospheres of Saturn and Jupiter as initially expressed by RBL.; ...|$|E

50|$|Graphene is a one-atom-thick planar {{sheet of}} sp2-bonded carbon atoms that are densely packed in a {{honeycomb}} crystal lattice. Optical absorption from graphene can become saturated when the input optical intensity is above a threshold value. This nonlinear optical behavior is termed saturable absorption and the threshold value {{is called the}} saturation fluency. Graphene can be saturated readily under strong excitation over the visible to near-infrared region, due to the universal optical absorption and zero band gap. This has relevance for the mode locking of fiber lasers, where wideband tunability may be obtained using graphene as the saturable absorber. Due to this special property, graphene has wide application in ultrafast photonics. Furthermore, comparing with the SWCNTs, as graphene has a 2D structure it should have much smaller non-saturable loss and much higher damage threshold. Self-started mode locking and stable soliton pulse emission with high energy have been achieved with a graphene saturable absorber in an erbium-doped fiber laser.Atomic layer graphene possesses wavelength-insensitive ultrafast saturable absorption, which can be exploited as a “full-band” mode locker.

40|$|The {{research}} into the subject of graphene has soared {{over the past few}} years. Due to the exceptional nature of some of its properties, it has become ever popular in the field of nanotechnology. The use of graphene for various electronics applications have been displayed using graphene that can be exfoliated or grown via several techniques. However, the scalability of these methods do not allow for bulk synthesis, known in the case of other graphitic nanomaterials like fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. For realistic applications, graphene has to be made in large quantities at a reasonable cost for use in, for example, solar cells, FETs, chemical sensors and engineering composites.
