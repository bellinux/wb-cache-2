40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} storability of pre-treated sesame seeds and to compare the effects of inorganic and organic seed treatments on the viability and vigour of sesame seeds during storage. Two hundred grammes of sesame seeds were treated separately with recommended dosages of Neem leaf <b>powder</b> (NLP), <b>Dress</b> force <b>powder</b> (DFP), Dry pepper powder (DPP) and untreated seeds being the control; each treatment placed in air-tight container and stored in a wooden cabinet at average ambient conditions of 26. 5 °C and 80 % RH {{for a period of}} 18 weeks. Completely randomized design was used for the experiment, with storage time and seed treatment as factors. Samples were drawn from storage at interval of two weeks and tested for seed viability and seedling vigour. Seed germination, seedling vigour index, speed of germination and rate of germination were evaluated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on the data collected, and treatment means were separated using Duncan’s Multiple Range Tests (DMRT). Correlation analysis was also carried out to ascertain the kinds of relationships that exist among the variables evaluated. Observations showed that NLP and DPP treatments had better mean seed germination of 89. 53 % and 82. 35 % respectively compared to DFP (46. 47 %) and control (80. 76). NLP also enhanced better seedling vigour index (339. 24) throughout the strorage time compared to DFP (99. 74). It is therefore recommended that natural botanicals like NLP could be adopted for short and medium term storage of sesame seeds; as it maintaned seed viability and seedling vigour optimally among other treatments. </p...|$|R

Standardized in vitro wounds were contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; ATCC 33591) and divided into six groups: no dressing (negative control), methacrylate dressing alone, and combinations with application of 0. 02 % Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB), 0. 4 % PHMB, 0. 1 % PHMB + 0. 1 % betaine, 7. 7 mg/mL Povidone-iodine (PVP-iodine), and 0. 1 % Octenidine-dihydrochloride (OCT) + 2 % phenoxyethanol. Bacterial load per gram tissue was measured over five days. The highest reduction was observed with PVP-iodine at 24 h to log 10 1. 43 cfu/g, followed by OCT at 48 h to log 10 2. 41 cfu/g. Whilst 0. 02 % PHMB resulted in a stable bacterial load over 120 h to log 10 4. 00 cfu/g over 120 h, 0. 1 % PHMB + 0. 1 % betaine inhibited growth during the first 48 h, with slightly increasing bacterial numbers up to log 10 5. 38 cfu/g at 120 h. These results indicate that this flexible methacrylate dressing can be loaded with various antiseptics serving as drug delivery system. Depending on the selected combination, an individually shaped and controlled antibacterial effect may be achieved using the same type of wound dressing...|$|R
40|$|Silver (Ag) {{possesses}} a well-known antibacterial activity {{and has been}} used for medical treatment and cosmetics such as wound <b>dressing</b> and deodorant <b>powders.</b> Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) proposed that the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for both metallic and most soluble Ag compounds should be 0. 01 mg/m 3. Argyria and argyrosis are known to be caused by deposition of insoluble Ag in the dermis and cornea/conjunctiva. However, the metabolic behavior and biological roles of Ag have not been well characterized in mammals. Ag can be absorbed into the systemic circulation from drinking water, and also through parenteral routes such as inhalation and dermal exposure. Experimental studies have demonstrated that Ag+ induces and binds to metallothionein I and II (MTs), which are cysteine-rich proteins, in cells. MTs are major cytoplasmic metal binding proteins and thereby reduce cellular damage caused by toxic heavy metals including Ag. Profiles of Ag distribution in MTs and other Ag-binding proteins can be determined using high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). This technique directly provides information on the intracellular behavior of Ag, which is important for elucidating the mechanism underlying Ag toxicity. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are also commercially used mainly as antimicrobial agents. Despite the widespread use of AgNPs, relatively few studies have been undertaken to evaluate the health effects of AgNP exposure. In the present paper, we discuss the absorption, toxicodynamics, and metabolism of both Ag and AgNPs in mammals and their health effects...|$|R
40|$|Libertine erotic novellas {{included}} {{a number of}} seductive descriptions of unfolding spaces often seen {{through the eyes of}} a narrator. Instructional volumes such as Point de lendermain by Vivant Denon (1777) aimed at the sexual education of young women and the titillation of men also followed suit. Similarly architectural theory such as Le Camus de Mézières’, The Genius of Architecture (1780) also promoted the sensuous and seductive aspects of surfaces and spatial arrangements. In the erotic settings of the cabinet, descriptions of curtains generate as much arousal as the outline of a naked body, and for some players it is the space that is desired above their lover. Many of these imaginary spaces of boudoirs and cabinets have been represented through filmic interpretations such as Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s Le Liaisons Dangereuses, Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette and the earlier 1938 Marie Antoinette. In these theatrically inspired scenographic interiors there are intense resources poured into reconstructing the materiality of the eighteenth century villa. These filmic reconstructions therefore provide a wealth of technical information about the re-imagining of eighteenth century architectural space, and themselves constitute a seduction for the audience through the use of extreme close-ups of characters being <b>dressed</b> and undressed, <b>powdered,</b> and corseted, that draw voyeuristic analogies between clothing and decor. This paper concludes that twentieth century filmic and re-imagined built environment adhere with surprising consistency to earlier narratives in fiction and art that relied similarly on the interplay between the unfolding of story and space. In these texts there is a collusion between seduction in words and architectural detailing, producing an inseparability that is witnessed by the concealed viewer.

In singing, he accompanied himself with facility and neatness, on an instrument of a peculiar kind, combining the properties of the pianoforte and the chamber organ, and so constructed that the performer could produce the tones of either instrument separately, or of both in combination. To this instrument were attached a set of bells, a side drum, a tambourine, and a gong, which he could bring into play by various mechanical contrivances, so as to give a pleasing variety to his accompaniments.' ...|$|R

They {{have a profound effect}} on the individual, and their associated symptoms such as bleeding, odor, exudate, and pain cause much distress, anxiety, and social isolation. Odor is cited by patients and clinicians as the worst aspect of such wounds. Strategies to manage odor at the wound site include the use of complementary and alternative therapies. This review aimed to synthesize the current evidence for the use of complementary and alternative therapies in the management of odor in MFWs. No restrictions on date, language, or care setting were applied. Nine databases were searched yielding four papers meeting our criteria. Of the four papers, one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and three were case studies. Two papers investigated the use of green tea teabags as a secondary dressing, while others used essential oils either combined with a cream applied directly to the wound or as a secondary dressing. In an RCT, green tea was used as a solution to cleanse the wound followed by the application of green tea teabag as a secondary <b>dressing</b> versus metronidazole <b>powder</b> for the management of odor over 7 days. All patients reported a reduction in odor and physical discomfort, and an improvement in social interaction and appetite, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant. The case studies all reported an improvement in odor management. The use of complementary and alternative therapies in the management of MFW-associated malodor is not supported by evidence from RCTs. Green tea may have potential as a secondary dressing to manage odor. Further research in this area is warranted.

In young and active patients these injuries are mainly caused by high energy trauma.

It is very safe and effective method of treatment. Treatment of the infections {{that occur in the}} early postoperative period after open reduction and internal fi xation represents a great problem and challenge for surgeons. It is widely accepted that the presence of deep infection can´t be cured in the presence of hardware. However, removal of hardware in the presence of unhealed fractures signifi cantly complicates sanation of infection and fracture itself. We have decided to present a 35 -years-old patient with a hardware infection with present chronic wound with hardware exposed eight months after the fi rst operation and six months after second operation. The wound measured one centimeter in diameter with cell detritus and bad granulations tissue inside the wound. Hardwre was exposed in the depth of the wound. The secretion was minimal. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) was applicated after debridemet and lavage performed in ambulatory conditions. The starting therapy was continuously – 125 mm Hg of vacuum.
