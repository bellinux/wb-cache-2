5|$|A {{number of}} supernovae have been <b>{{discovered}}</b> <b>in</b> Coma Berenices. Four (SN 1940B, SN 1969H, SN 1987E and SN 1999gs) {{were in the}} NGC 4725 galaxy, and another four were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> the M99 galaxy (NGC 4254): SN 1967H, SN 1972Q, SN 1986I and SN 2014L. Five were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> the M100 galaxy (NGC 4321): SN 1901B, SN 1914A, SN 1959E, SN 1979C and SN 2006X. SN 1940B, discovered on 5 May 1940, was the first observed type II supernova. SN 2005ap, discovered on 3 March 2005, is the brightest known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not {{visible to the naked}} eye and was discovered telescopically. SN1979C, <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light.|$|E
