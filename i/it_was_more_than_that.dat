500|$|Bede {{describes}} Æthelberht's {{relationship with}} Rædwald, king of East Anglia, in a passage {{that is not}} completely clear in meaning. It seems to imply that Rædwald retained ducatus, or military command of his people, even while Æthelberht held imperium. This implies that being a bretwalda usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> since Æthelberht is bretwalda despite Rædwald's control of his own troops. Rædwald was converted to Christianity while in Kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs; this, together {{with the fact that}} he retained military independence, implies that Æthelberht's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as [...] "Rædwald, king of the East Angles, who while Æthelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people"; if this is Bede's intent, then East Anglia firmly was under Æthelberht's overlordship.|$|E

60|$|Despite my two {{disastrous}} experiences, {{here was}} John Barleycorn, prevalent and accessible {{everywhere in the}} community, luring and drawing me. Here were connotations of the saloon making deep indentations in a child's mind. Here was a child, forming its first judgments of the world, finding the saloon a delightful and desirable place. Stores, nor public buildings, nor all the dwellings of men ever opened their doors to me and let me warm by their fires or permitted me to eat the food of the gods from narrow shelves against the wall. Their doors were ever closed to me; the saloon's doors were ever open. And always and everywhere I found saloons, on highway and byway, up narrow alleys and on busy thoroughfares, bright-lighted and cheerful, warm in winter, and in summer dark and cool. Yes, the saloon was a mighty fine place, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

60|$|That {{was in the}} Colosseum, {{and it was as}} far as {{they got}} that day, because Helen {{returned}} with Fanny--she had taken her into the upper galleries. Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea, already vivid and concrete enough, became now realistic in the highest degree. She figured that pleasant young man lecturing in the most edifying way to his students, herself modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and helper; she figured a refined little home, with two bureaus, with white shelves of high-class books, and autotypes of the pictures of Rossetti and Burne Jones, with Morris's wall-papers and flowers in pots of beaten copper. Indeed she figured many things. On the Pincio the two had a few precious moments together, while Helen marched Fanny off to see the muro Torto, and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped their friendship was only beginning, that he already found her company very precious to him, that indeed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{turned out}} to be true. The face of the water, in time, became a {{wonderful}} book--a book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger, but which told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with a voice. And it was not a book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every day. Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was never a page that was void of interest, never one that you could leave unread without loss, never one that you would want to skip, thinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing. There never was so wonderful a book written by man; never one whose interest was so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparkingly renewed with every reperusal. The passenger who could not read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions when he did not overlook it altogether); but to the pilot that was an ITALICIZED passage; indeed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> it was a legend of the largest capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation points at the end of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated. It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes, and the most hideous to a pilot's eye. In truth, the passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas to the trained eye these were not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of reading-matter.|$|E
60|$|First: I have {{personally}} known three {{instances where}} a whale, {{after receiving a}} harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think {{it may have been}} something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.|$|E

60|$|Sinking {{back in her}} chair, Gyp sat motionless. Bees were murmurous {{among her}} flowers, pigeons murmurous among the trees; the {{sunlight}} warmed her knees, and her stretched-out feet through the openwork of her stockings. The maid's laughter, the delicious growling of the puppies at play in the kitchen came drifting down the garden, with the distant cry of a milkman up the road. All was very peaceful. But in her heart were such curious, baffled emotions, such strange, tangled feelings. This moment of enlightenment regarding the measure of her husband's frankness came close {{on the heels of}} the moment fate had chosen for another revelation, for clinching within her a fear felt for weeks past. She had said to Winton that she did not want to have a child. In those conscious that their birth has caused death or even too great suffering, there is sometimes this hostile instinct. She had not even the consolation that Fiorsen wanted children; she knew that he did not. And now she was sure one was coming. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> She had not reached, and knew she could not reach, that point of spirit-union which alone makes marriage sacred, and the sacrifices demanded by motherhood a joy. She was fairly caught in the web of her foolish and presumptuous mistake! So few months of marriage--and so sure that it was a failure, so hopeless for the future! In the light of this new certainty, it was terrifying. A hard, natural fact is needed to bring a yearning and bewildered spirit to knowledge of the truth. Disillusionment is not welcome to a woman's heart; the less welcome when it is disillusionment with self as much as with another. Her great dedication--her scheme of life! She had been going to--what?--save Fiorsen from himself! It was laughable. She had only lost herself. Already she felt in prison, and by a child would be all the more bound. To some women, the knowledge that a thing must be brings assuagement of the nerves. Gyp was the opposite of those. To force her was the way to stiver up every contrary emotion. She might will herself to acquiesce, but--one cannot change one's nature.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are times}} when I think it wasn’t stupidity. Maybe, like some men I know, he was too wise to work. I shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over us with that {{intelligence}} of his.

40|$|Value-laden science. Reflections on science, {{morality}} and {{society at the}} onset of the Dutch Breakthrough movement At the close of the Second World War, a group of Dutch intellectuals devised a blueprint for a planned society. Although this scheme was highly technocratic, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> in the task which it attributed to scientific experts, for their function was to check not only the efficiency of plans but also their general desirability. In this paper, I show how this peculiar formulation of the expert's role was the result of a series of debates on the (extent of the) moral character of science and its place in society, that had taken place in the Netherlands since the mid-i 930 s. Starting with a scientists' response to the rise of fascism, these discussions took shape in conjunction with the Breakthrough movement and its anti-positivist desires for engaged knowledge and a synthesis of intellectual and ethical concerns. The physicist J. M. Burgers, who had been involved in many of the debates, finally found a solution for the problems in A. N. Whitehead's philosophy. On the basis of this, he developed a moral epistemology and the plans for a science-led society mentioned above. Although these plans found much support in the post-war Breakthrough government, they were never realized...|$|E

"On the futuristic ramp of Detroit's Cobo Hall, a parade of 1961 model autos spiraled down from the roof to be enshrined, almost like jewels, for this week's opening of the 43 rd National Auto Show in the brand-new 54 million exposition palace beside the Detroit River. This was a sight guaranteed to stir excitement in the breast of a car-conscious nation on wheels. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> The manufacture of automobiles {{is one of the}} nation's largest industries and a major index of the health of its economy. Here Detroit hoped to learn whether the public would approve what it was offering. Here too it could be possible to foretell with fair accuracy whether the nation could expect a year of boom or business doldrums. Detroit's splash with the ' 61 s takes on even greater significance because this is an election year in which {{the state of the economy}} and how to improve its future has become a bitterly divisive issue between Vice President Nixon and Senator John Kennedy. President Eisenhower tacitly acknowledged the political importance of what went on in Cobo Hall by promising to make an address there on October 17. Big as it is, the issue is bigger than the 1961 model year. It is the absorbing issue of what goes into and comes out of every American's pocket book. It is an issue composed of vital stuff, measured in terms of prices, job or no job, growth or no growth [...] and it is an essential background for voting. ...|$|E
