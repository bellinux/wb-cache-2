After 24 h, the leaves crispness increased 49 and 29 % for leaves treated with calcium chloride and lactate at pH 5 and the elasticity increased 100 % after <b>calcium</b> propionate <b>treatment</b> at pH 7.

The proportions of phospholipid classes did not change during senescence. The catabolism of phospholipids was delayed by 0. 05 m calcium, but accelerated by 0. 25 m, as compared to the untreated control.

However, their effect on creatinine levels and kidney function has not been well studied. We investigated the effect of calcium supplementation on blood creatinine concentration in a randomized controlled trial of colorectal adenoma chemoprevention conducted between 2004 - 2013 at 11 clinical centers in the United States. Healthy participants (N =  1, 675) aged 45 - 75 {{with a history of}} colorectal adenoma were assigned to daily supplementation with calcium (1200 mg, as carbonate), vitamin D 3 (1000 IU), both, or placebo for three or five years. Changes in blood creatinine and total calcium concentration were measured after one year of treatment and multiple linear regression was used to estimate effects on creatinine concentrations. After one year of treatment, blood creatinine was 0. 013 ± 0. 006 mg/dL higher on average among participants randomized to calcium compared to placebo after adjustment for other determinants of creatinine (P =  0. 03). However, the effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> appeared to be larger among participants who consumed the most alcohol (2 - 6 drinks/day) or whose estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was less than 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 at baseline.

40|$|In steelmaking, {{commonly}} used <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> has {{the benefit of}} modifying inclusion composition, and the shape and size of these inclusions are also adjusted. Two of the main advantages of <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> are not only {{the improvement of the}} castability but also the improvement of the final properties of the steels' machinability, toughness and surface quality. The effects of calcium are mainly based on its strong ability to form sulphides and oxides. In aluminium deoxidised steels, the inclusion population will generally include alumina inclusions and maybe some silicates and manganese sulphides. After <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment,</b> the inclusions are restricted mainly to calcium aluminates (CaO-Al 2 O 3) and the sulphur in the steel is associated with these inclusions as calcium sulphide. The topic of the present study concerns the basic mechanism and kinetics of the transformation process of alumina inclusions in steel when calcium is introduced into the steel e. g., by wire feeding or powder injection. To clarify the mechanisms, several types of model experiments were performed in laboratory furnaces and on an industrial scale. Reactions between only Al 2 O 3 and CaO were studied in a laboratory furnace. The phases formed during the reaction between Al 2 O 3 and CaO were examined by SEM-EDS, and a discussion of the proposed reaction sequence of Al 2 O 3 ⇒CA 6 ⇒CA 2 ⇒CA⇒CAx (liquid) was based on the experimental observations and thermodynamic equilibrium examinations. The kinetics of the reaction of calcium with alumina inclusions were simulated by performing Ca treatments in an induction furnace for 8  kg steel deoxidised with aluminium. Results were compared with observations of inclusion transformation in a real steelmaking process. Based on the results, a kinetic model was proposed. reviewe...|$|R

Methods: Our analysis used patients from the Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled chemopreven-tion trial among patients with a recent colorectal adenoma. Nine hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned to calcium carbonate (1200 mg/day) or placebo. Follow-up colonoscopies were conducted approximately 1 and 4 years after the qualifying examination. We used general estimating equation (GEE) and generalized linear regression analyses to compute risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> versus placebo on the risk of hyperplastic polyps, tubular adenomas, and more advanced lesions. Additionally, we used GEE analyses to compare the <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> effects for various types of polyps with that for tubular adenomas. We also examined the interaction between <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> and baseline in-take of dietary calcium, fat, and fiber. All P values were obtained using Wald tests based on the corresponding mod-els. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. Re-sults: The calcium risk ratio for hyperplastic polyps was 0. 82 (95 % CI 0. 67 to 1. 00), that for tubular adenomas was 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 77 to 1. 03), and that for histologically advanced neoplasms was 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 46 to 0. 93) compared with patients assigned to placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between the risk ratio for tubular adenomas and that for other types of polyps. The effect of calcium supplementation on adenoma risk was most pro-nounced among individuals with high dietary intakes of calcium and fiber and with low intake of fat, but the inter-actions were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our results suggest that calcium supplementation may have a more pronounced antineoplastic effect on advanced colorec-tal lesions than on other types of polyps. [J Natl Cancer Ins...|$|R

40|$|Strawberries are an {{extremely}} perishable fruit mainly {{due to their}} soft texture and sensitivity to fungal infection. The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea is responsible for grey mould on strawberries and is the main causal agent of postharvest decay and subsequent economic loss. As an alternative to fungicides, manipulation of plant nutrition, such as calcium and boron, has been suggested {{as a means of}} disease management. This project investigated the effects of calcium and boron application on fruit quality and grey mould development in strawberry. The effect of calcium on fruit quality, grey mould development and leaf blight in strawberry cultivars ‘Aromas’ and ‘Selva’ was investigated through preharvest and postharvest applications. To determine the effect of preharvest application, calcium sulphate in 0. 25 X strength Hoagland’s solution was applied at 0, 100, 300 and 500 ppm Ca through fertigation. Fully-ripened fruit were harvested and evaluated for postharvest quality at harvest and then after storage at 10 ⁰C, 90 ± 5 % RH for 2 to 10 days. Although fruit firmness of both cultivars declined slightly during storage, this was not affected by preharvest calcium application. Similarly, preharvest <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> had no effect on the external appearance, pH, soluble solids content (SSC) or titratable acidity (TA). No grey mould development was observed on fruit at harvest when flowers were inoculated with a conidia suspension of B. cinerea (10 ⁴ conidia per mL). However, fruit harvested from plants that received calcium at any concentration had less incidence of grey mould during storage at 10 ⁰C, 90 ± 5 % RH for 14 days than fruit harvested from plants that received no calcium for both cultivars. For ‘Aromas’, 79 % and 51 % of fruit, and for ‘Selva’, 69 % and 43 % of fruit, showed rot when treated with 0 and 500 ppm Ca, respectively. The shelf life of ‘Aromas’ and ‘Selva’ increased by about 8 % when plants received 500 ppm Ca in comparison with plants that received 0 ppm Ca. After 7 days of incubation at 22 to 24 ⁰C, {{there was no difference between}} blight lesions on wound-inoculated detached leaves from different <b>calcium</b> <b>treatments</b> for either cultivar. However, the lesions on ‘Selva’ were smaller than on ‘Aromas’. The calcium levels in leaves from plants that received calcium at any concentration were adequate for strawberry growing and significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than in leaves from plants that received 0 ppm Ca. However, <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> did not ensure transfer of calcium to fruit tissues. Calcium lactate and calcium chloride were used as postharvest <b>calcium</b> <b>treatments</b> at 1500, 3000 and 4500 ppm Ca. Fruit of ‘Selva’ were dipped in calcium solution for 5 min and wound-inoculated with B. cinerea (10 ⁶ conidia per mL). Calcium lactate and calcium chloride at 3000 and 4500 ppm Ca, respectively, were most effective in delaying Botrytis rot development on ‘Selva’ after 7 days of storage at 10 ⁰C, 90 ± 5 % RH. Storage for least 24 h after calcium dips prior to inoculation was required to delay the development of fruit rot. Fruit harvested early in the season seemed to be less susceptible to grey mould than those harvested later. However, <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> tended to be more effective when applied to late-season fruit. Preharvest boron treatment, applied as for calcium but at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 ppm B, had no effect on fruit firmness of either cultivar. However, firmness of ‘Aromas’ fruit was slightly greater than ‘Selva’ fruit for all treatments. The amount of boron applied had no effect on the external appearance, pH, SSC or TA for either cultivar after storage of fruit for up to 10 days. Application of boron had no effect on fruit grey mould development in either cultivar. Furthermore, boron had minimal effect on the incidence of blight on woundinoculated detached leaves of ‘Aromas’ 7 days after inoculation. However, blight lesion diameters on ‘Selva’ leaves in the 1. 0 ppm B treatment (8. 0 mm) were significantly smaller (P < 0. 001) than in the 0 ppm B treatment (13. 0 mm). Phytotoxicity was observed in boron treatments even at the level considered optimum for strawberry growing. Severity increased with increasing boron concentration but no consistent effect on flower death or flower abortion was observed. In conclusion, strawberry is sensitive to boron toxicity. Calcium may enhance fruit firmness and, consequently, delay grey mould development if calcium penetrates the fruit. Postharvest <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> tended to be more effective in delaying development of grey mould when applied to late-season fruit. Calcium lactate is a potential alternative to calcium chloride for reducing decay caused by B. cinerea in strawberry without providing undesirable bitterness. This finding may provide a basis for application in industry. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Agriculture, Food and Wine 200...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} kidney disease (CKD) have {{increased}} risk of fractures, yet the optimal treatment is unknown. In secondary analyses of large randomized trials, bisphosphonates {{have been shown to}} improve bone mineral density and reduce fractures. However, bisphosphonates are currently not recommended in patients with advanced kidney disease due to concern about oversuppressing bone remodeling, which may increase the risk of developing arterial calcification. In the present study we used a naturally occurring rat model of CKD with secondary hyperparathyroidism, the Cy/+ rat, and compared the efficacy of treatment with zoledronic acid, calcium given in water to simulate a phosphate binder, and the combination of calcium and zoledronic acid. Animals were treated beginning at 25 weeks of age (approximately 30 % of normal renal function) and followed for 10 weeks. The results demonstrate that both zoledronic acid and calcium improved bone volume by micro-computed tomography (µCT) and both equally suppressed the mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate, and mineralizing surface of trabecular bone. In contrast, only <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> with or without zoledronic acid improved cortical porosity and cortical biomechanical properties (ultimate load and stiffness) and lowered parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, only <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> led to the adverse effects of increased arterial calcification and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23). These results suggest zoledronic acid may improve trabecular bone volume in CKD in the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, but does not benefit extraskeletal calcification or cortical biomechanical properties. Calcium effectively reduces PTH and benefits both cortical and trabecular bone yet increases the degree of extra skeletal calcification...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science, Rampur, Chitwan during 2003 {{to find out the}} effect of harvesting method and <b>calcium</b> chloride <b>treatment</b> on post-harvest physiology of tomato. Tomato (Hybrid Gootya) fruits with stalk and without stalk were harvested at breaker stage and dipped in distilled water and different concentrations of calcium chloride viz. 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 0. 75 % and 1 % for fifteen minutes. Fruit were then air-dried and stored at ambient condition (24 ± 30 C and 70 ± 5 % RH). Among the tested treatments the least cumulative physiological weight loss (12. 14 %) was exhibited by 1 % calcium chloride. The shelf life of tomato fruits was significantly affected by harvesting method and <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment.</b> Tomato fruit harvested with stalk had higher shelf-life (15 days) as compared to those harvested without stalk (12. 93 days) irrespective to calcium chloride application. The maximum shelf life was noticed in 1 % calcium chloride treated fruits (16. 50 days) followed by 0. 75 % calcium chloride treated fruits (16. 17 days).

40|$|Besides <b>high-temperature</b> <b>calcium</b> {{phosphates}} (CaPs), low-temperature {{calcium phosphate}} bone cements (CPCs), due to excellent biological properties: bioactivity, biocompability and osteoconductivity, are successfully used as bone substitutes. However, some disad-vantages, related mainly to their low resorption rate and poor mechanical properties result in {{limited range of}} applications of these im-plant materials to non-loaded places in the skeletal system. To overcome this problem, magnesium phosphate cements (MPCs) with high strength have been considered as biomaterials. The main disadvantage of MPCs is that the acid-base setting reaction is an exothermic process that must be strictly controlled to avoid tissue necrosis. In this work, a new composite bone substitute (Hydroxyapatite Magnesium Phosphate Material – HMPM) based on hydroxyapatite (HA) and magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) with sodium pyrophosphate applied as a retardant of setting reaction was obtained. Its setting time was adequate for clinical applications. Combining properties of HA and MPC {{has made it possible}} to obtain microporous (showing bimodal pore size distribution in the range of 0. 005 – 1. 700 micrometers) potential implant material showing good surgical handiness and sufficient mechanical strength. Effectiveness of sodium pyrophosphate as a retardant of exothermic setting reaction of the new cement formulation was confirmed. After setting and hardening, the material consisted of hydroxyapatite and struvite as crystalline phases. Unreacted magnesium oxide was not detected.

40|$|Recent {{secondary}} analyses have associated supplemental calcium {{use with}} {{increased risk for}} myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related death in healthy, older adults. Subsequent concern over the safety of calcium supplements has spurred a calcium controversy, because calcium is a shortfall essential nutrient that is critical for bone health and a mainstay of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. The proposed mechanism by which calcium intake may detriment cardiovascular health is through the acceleration of coronary artery calcification (CAC), a clinical indicator of coronary artery disease (CAD) that {{has been associated with}} mortality risk. However, causal evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking. Determining causality between calcium intake and cardiovascular risk has been hindered by the long intervention period necessary to monitor disease progression in human populations and a lack of sensitive outcome measures to detect early vascular calcification. ^ The aim of this research was to assess the effect of high calcium consumption from calcium carbonate or dairy on cardiovascular function, CAD burden and coronary artery calcium deposition in the Ossabaw swine, a model that mimics human metabolic syndrome and CAD when fed an atherogenic diet. Pigs (n= 24) were maintained on an atherogenic diet and randomized to one of three <b>calcium</b> <b>treatments</b> including control <b>calcium</b> (0. 5 % Ca by weight), high calcium from calcium carbonate (2 % Ca), or high calcium from dairy (2 % Ca) for 6 months. To sensitively assess CAC with calcium tracer kinetics, pigs were dosed with the rare isotope, 41 Ca, that can be measured in blood and tissues at a sensitivity of 10 - 18 M by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). More traditional measures of cardiovascular health and disease were also utilized including computed tomography (CT), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), histopathology and in vitro wire myography. ^ 41 Ca:Ca accumulation measured in the coronary arteries did not differ by <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment.</b> Further, <b>calcium</b> tracer kinetic modeling revealed the rates of calcium transport from blood to the coronary arteries were similar among groups. These findings were corroborated by collective data obtained through CT, IVUS and histopathology that showed no treatment differences in atherosclerotic or calcified plaque coverage of the coronary arteries. Further analysis of coronary artery endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function by in vitro wire myography revealed no differences among <b>calcium</b> <b>treatment</b> groups. ^ High calcium intakes from calcium carbonate or dairy did not alter cardiovascular function or aggravate atherosclerotic or calcified plaque deposition in coronary arteries of Ossabaw miniature swine fed an atherogenic diet. ...|$|R

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about early {{molecular}} events triggering epithelial cell differentiation. We have examined the possible role of tyrosine phosphorylation in this process, as observed in cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes after exposure to calcium or 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). Immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies as well as direct phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that induction of tyrosine phosphorylation occurs as a very early and specific event in keratinocyte differentiation. Very little or no induction of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in a keratinocyte cell line resistant to the differentiating effects of <b>calcium.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors prevented induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by calcium and TPA and interfered with the differentiative effects of these agents. These results suggest that specific activation of tyrosine kinase(s) may play an important regulatory role in keratinocyte differentiation...|$|R

30|$|Spraying of {{modified}} {{calcium phytate}} {{in a mixture}} of water and ethanol generated comparable results for Mw and carbonyl groups to those of the untreated control, implying that no stable complexing with copper ions could be achieved. A reason that modified <b>calcium</b> phytate <b>treatment</b> was better than pure aqueous calcium phytate is that relatively fewer copper ions were released during the treatment due to its lower water content. The modified calcium phytate followed by <b>calcium</b> hydrogen carbonate <b>treatment</b> caused even more degradation, presumably due to a prolonged treatment time with water-based solution, which led to more migration of copper ions but limited benefit from deacidification, as discussed previously.|$|R
