5000|$|The site is {{also known}} for the April Fools' Day jokes that it pulls annually. In 2003, Leaky posted a copy of 93 words {{allegedly}} emailed to the site, in reference to a 93-word card auctioned off the previous December with information about {{the plot of the}} upcoming fifth Potter book. In 2004, actor Jim Tavaré, who would appear later that year in the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as Tom the Barman, attempted to oust the [...] "Muggles" [...] from the site. In 2005, the site closed <b>down,</b> <b>posting</b> a note about how tired the webmasters were of handling the foolish questions sent to them by readers each day. As a replacement, the site opened [...] "Ask Peeves", a spoof on the Ask Jeeves search engine. In 2006, both the Leaky Cauldron and fellow Potter fansite MuggleNet shut down and redirected visitors to a new site, the Leaky Mug. The Leaky Mug's first announcement was the marriage of Leaky webmaster Melissa Anelli to MuggleNet webmaster Emerson Spartz. The two claimed to have merged their sites in the same way they had merged their lives. The next day, both sites were running normally; J.K. Rowling discussed the joke later on her official website. In 2007, Leaky posted a news item that said it'd be closing its doors following the upcoming publication of the final Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In 2008, the Leaky Cauldron announced that Sybill Trelawney, a Hogwarts professor of divination in the Potter series, would be joining the site's staff as a news editor. Leaky also announced that Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe would be eschewing his famous nude scenes in the upcoming Broadway debut of his play Equus and that the wizard rock band Harry and the Potters was disbanding. In 2009, the site automatically redirected to another website, Hooter, a play on Twitter. In 2010, the Leaky Cauldron became [...] "the Gleeky Cauldron", a fansite for the popular Fox TV show Glee.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{friction}} at {{the connection of}} the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) aft skirt and the mobile launch platform (MLP) hold <b>down</b> <b>posts</b> was analyzed. A simplified model of the shuttle response during the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) buildup was constructed. The model included the effect of stick-slip friction for {{the rotation of the}} skirt about the spherical bearing. Current finite element models assume the joint is completely frictionless in rotation and therefore no moment is transferred between the skirt and the hold <b>down</b> <b>posts.</b> The model was partially verified against test data and preliminary parameter studies were performed. The parameter studies indicated that the coefficient of friction strongly influenced the moment on the hold <b>down</b> <b>posts.</b> The coefficient of friction had little effect on hold <b>down</b> <b>post</b> vertical loads, however. Further calibration of the model is necessary before the effect of friction on the hold <b>down</b> <b>post</b> horizontal loads can be analyzed...|$|R
