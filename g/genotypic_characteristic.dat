The characters used for the analysis are position and proper motion of all the stars belonging to the cluster’s region. Taxonomy allows to groups the stars together (OTU’s) in clusters, based on its <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristic,</b> which shows the similarity, between two or more Stars (OTU’s). The method {{has been applied to}} open cluster NGC 2516. The outcome list of members agrees very well with the one obtained by applying other methods. Fil: Orellana, Rosa Beatriz.

Biochemical Processes {{are expected to}} be low demand energy processes and certainly ecofriendly. Results:A strain of biosurfactant producing bacterium was isolated from an oil contaminated soil at Tehran refinery distillation unit. Based on selected phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristic</b> including morphology, biochemical proprety, and 16 SrRNA sequencing identified as a novel strain of Bacillus cereus (JQ 178332). This bacterium endures a wide range of pH, salinity and temperature. This specific strain utilizes both paraffin and anthracene as samples of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability of this bacterium to acquire all its energy and chemical requirements from Vacuum Distillation Residue (VR), as a net sample of problematic hydrocarbons in refineries, was studied. SARA test ASTM D 4124 - 01 revealed 65. 5 % decrease in asphaltenic, 22. 1 % in aliphatics and 30. 3 % in Aromatics content of the VR in MSM medium.

40|$|The Objective of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the existence of Campylobacter jejuni based on phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristic</b> in local chicken and chicken meats. Samples of local chicken intestine and meat were tested for the bacterial existence. Phenotypic examination was carried out by means of cultivation followed by gram staining and biochemical tests. Genotypic examination was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genus specific 16 S rRNA gene at 816 bp and membrane-associated protein A (mapA) gene at 589 bp as Campylobacter jejuni species-specific gene. The result of phenotypic detection revealed the existence of Campylobacter spp as gram negative, curved rod shape, oxidase positive, urease negative and motile. Genotypic examination also indicated the existence of bacteria using both primers. However, no Campylobacter jejuni detected from meat of the chickens. The results suggest that the method of PCR using a primer detecting species-specific gene of Campylobacter jejuni gives a rapid and accurate detection of the bacteria as compared to that using phenotypic and biochemical test. Identification of Campylobacter spp from chicken meats should be improved with enrichment method and sample collection.

40|$|Sesleria caerulea {{is a wide}} ranging species, growing over a large altitudinal range. It varies {{spatially}} in both morphological {{and physiological}} characteristics. Responses to stress are characterised {{by an increase in}} proline production, but the ability to respond is not consistent for all populations. Edaphic factors are important in determining the nature of the response to cold stress, but if edaphic factors are standardized, proline production can be correlated with altitude plants at high elevations accumulate more proline than those from lower elevations. Edaphic factors are more important than climatic factors in determining the plant's ability to respond to drought stress. Plants growing in shallow soils produce more proline than those of deep soils, and are therefore more drought tolerant. The ability to produce proline appears to be maintained through out the plant's life, with {{no significant difference between the}} quantities of proline produced in the apical and basal halves of leaf blades.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{address the}} {{question}} of whether T-cell-line adaptation of the original LAI and MN (NM) HIV- 1 populations biased the interpretation of the intraindividual and population-wide virus distributions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HIV- 1 genomic RNA coding for the gp 120 C 2 V 3 region was obtained from serum samples of patients LAI and MN and compared to the proviral DNA derived from simultaneously sampled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as B-and T-cell lines. RESULTS: Two (10 %) of 20 clones of HIV- 1 LAI RNA and none of 16 clones of the HIV- 1 MN RNA carried syncytium-inducing (SI) -determining amino-acid changes. HIV- 1 LAI RNA formed on SI and two non-SI (NSI) phylogenetic clusters. The HIV- 1 LAI DNA in PBMC included both SI and NSI clones but lacked one NSI cluster and contributed NSI clones to the SI cluster as well as an SI clone to the NSI cluster, indicating the existence of an intermediate SI/NSI genotype. In vitro culture using either primary cells or B-cell lines yielded only SI clones, distributed over two SI/NSI mixed clusters. Long-term propagation in T-cell lines further restricted the clonality and yielded SI clones belonging to only one cluster. On the population level, HIV- 1 LAI, MN and BRU sequences all clustered according to the individual host and apart from each other and separate from the epidemiological controls without notable influence of SI/NSI distinction or cell-culture adaptation.

40|$|Grain {{weight is}} a <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristic</b> that is {{directly}} related to the realization of yield. Analysis of average grain weight was performed in ten genotypes of winter hexaploid triticale (Trimaran, Ticino, Odisej, Agrano, BLT 21, BLT 17, BLT 10, Max 1793, Bogo and Tornado). Experiment was conducted during 2005 / 06, 2006 / 07, 2007 / 08. in Trapisti, region Banja Luka. During the experiment of winter triticale standard agricultural practice was applied. Microclimatic conditions during triticale cultivation in 2006 and 2008. were relatively similar, while in 2007. there was drought period occurrence. Statistical analysis of observed genotypes for the specified parameter was performed with method analysis of variance 10 x 3. Analyses of significant differences were done by using LSD test, while interactive effect was analyzed by graphical method. The average weight of triticale genotypes grain regardless of the year showed highly statistically significant differences, while in observation of years regardless of the genotype showed mutually statistically significant differences. Analysis of these relationships was observed through the interaction effects as a final evaluation of the observed genotypes. Based on the average values of the grain weight, winter triticale genotypes were evaluated. The average grain weight of triticale genotypes in the observed years showed the lowest average weight in 2007 (0. 0369 g), while the highest grain weight was obtained in 2006 (0. 0406 g). Statistically significant difference of the average grain weight of the observed genotypes of triticale regardless of the year showed that genotypes Bogo (0. 0465 g), Odisej (0. 0453 g) and BLT 10 (0. 0424 g) were those of the highest average grain weight without significant differences between them.

40|$|Differences amongst wheat cultivars in {{the rate}} of {{reproductive}} development are largely dependent on differences in their sensitivity to photoperiod and vernalization. However, when these responses are accounted for, by growing vernalized seedlings under long photoperiods, cultivars can still differ markedly in time to ear emergence. Control of rate of development by this ‘third factor’ has been poorly understood and is variously referred to as intrinsic earliness, earliness in the narrow sense, basic vegetative period, earliness per se, and basic development rate. Certain assumptions are made in the concept of intrinsic earliness. They are that differences in intrinsic earliness (i) are independent of the responses of the cultivars to photoperiod and vernalization, (ii) apply only to the length of the vegetative period up to floral initiation (as suggested by several authors), (iii) are maintained under different temperatures, measured either in days or degree days. As a consequence of this, the ranking of cultivars (from intrinsically early to intrinsically late) must be maintained at different temperatures. This paper, by the re-analysis of published data, examines {{the extent to which these}} assumptions can be supported. Although it is shown that intrinsic earliness operates independently of photoperiod and vernalization responses, the other assumptions were not supported. The differences amongst genotypes in time to ear emergence, grown under above-optimum vernalization and photoperiod (that is when the response to these factors is saturated), were not exclusively due to parallel differences in the length of the vegetative phase, and the length of the reproductive phase was independent of that of the vegetative phase. Thus, it would be possible to change the relative allocation of time to vegetative and reproductive periods with no change in the full period to ear emergence. The differences in intrinsic earliness between cultivars were modified by the temperature regime under which they were grown, i. e. the difference between cultivars (both considering the full phase to ear emergence or some sub-phases) was not a constant amount of time or thermal time at different temperatures. In addition, in some instances genotypes changed their ranking for ‘intrinsic earliness’ depending on the temperature regime. This was interpreted to mean that while all genotypes are sensitive to temperature they differ amongst themselves in the extent of that sensitivity. Therefore, ‘intrinsic earliness’ should not be considered as a static <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristic,</b> but the result of the interaction between the genotype and temperature. Intrinsic earliness is therefore likely to be related to temperature sensitivity. Some implications of these conclusions for plant breeding and crop simulation modelling are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{at present}} {{one of the}} most common {{nosocomial}} infections in the developed world. Hypervirulent strains (PCR ribotype 027) of C. difficile which produce enhanced levels of toxins have also been associated with other characteristics such as a greater rate of sporulation and resistance to fluoroquinolones. Infection due to C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 has also been associated with greater rates of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this thesis was to investigate both the phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of two populations of toxigenic clinical isolates of C. difficile which were recovered from two separate hospital trusts within the UK. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates was undertaken using analytical profile indexes (APIs), minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) and S-layer protein typing. In addition to this, isolates were also investigated for the production of a range of extracellular enzymes as potential virulence factors. Genotypic characterisation was performed using a random amplification of polymorphic DNA(RAPD) PCR protocol which was fully optimised in this study, and the gold standard method, PCR ribotyping. The discriminatory power of both methods was compared and the similarity between the different isolates also analysed. Associations between the phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> and the recovery location of the isolate were then investigated. Extracellular enzyme production and API testing revealed little variation between the isolates; with S-layer typing demonstrating low discrimination. Minimum inhibitory concentrations did not identify any resistance towards either vancomycin or metronidazole; there were however significant differences in the distribution of antibiogram profiles of isolates recovered from the two different trusts. The RAPD PCR protocol was successfully optimised and alongside PCR ribotyping, effectively typed all of the clinical isolates and also identified differences in the number of types defined between the two locations. Both PCR ribotyping and RAPD demonstrated similar discriminatory power; however, the two genotyping methods did not generate amplicons that mapped directly onto each other and therefore clearly characterised isolates based on different genomic markers. The RAPD protocol also identified different subtypes within PCR ribotypes, therefore demonstrating that all isolates defined as a particular PCR ribotype were not the same strain. No associations could be demonstrated between the phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> observed; however, the location from which an isolate was recovered did appear to influence antibiotic resistance and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> observed amongst the C. difficile isolates in this study, may provide a basis for the identification of further targets which may be potentially incorporated into future methods for the characterisation of C. difficile isolates.

Overall, 63 serotypes, nine antibiotic resistance profiles, and 65 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles were observed among the 100 isolates. Based on the combination of phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics,</b> the 100 E. coli isolates were classified into 76 clonal types. The numbers of different phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of E. coli were observed for each cow at ranges of 2 – 10, 1 – 4, 2 – 10, and 4 – 10 for serotypes, antibiograms, PFGE profiles, and clonal types, respectively.

It was estimated that a range of 3 – 55, 1 – 4, 2 – 55, and 8 – 55 fecal isolates from one cow would be required to include all possible types of E. coli based on serotype, antibiotic resistance profile, PFGE profile, and clonal type respectively. Based on the findings of the study it can be inferred that 1) dairy cattle should be considered as a significant reservoir of genotypically and phenotypically diverse E. coli, and 2) epidemiological investigations that focus on commensal bacteria should take into consideration the diversity within the species being investigated; if not addressed adequately, inappropriate sample size could lead to inaccurate study findings...|$|R

Clinically significant N. gonorrhoeae isolates (n = 76) from 76 consecutive patients in Arkhangelsk, Russia were characterised by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, serovar determination, porB gene sequencing and N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). The isolates were assigned to 12 different serovars, displayed 35 divergent porB sequences, and belonged to 40 different sequence types (STs). All the serovars, but only seven of the STs, had been identified previously in other countries. Twelve ST clusters of between two and 14 isolates were identified, which indicated that many multiple transmission networks exist in Arkhangelsk. The high number of unique STs (n = 28) may be a consequence of sub-optimal diagnostic procedures, ineffective partner tracing, local emergence of new STs, import of strains via sexual tourists, or foreign travel.
