5|$|Morales {{was born}} on 1 April 1865 in La Chimba, a barrio on the Mapocho River in Santiago de Chile, the {{daughter}} of carpenter Ventura Morales and Marta Infante. Her father {{died when she was}} young, and she moved with her mother to Valparaiso. There she started to learn her mother's trade as a seamstress until her mother married her to an older man in 1877, at age 11. <b>Her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> {{during the first year of}} their marriage, and her mother died about the same time.|$|E
5|$|After <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> in 1841, {{a series}} of {{complications}} obstructed Hańska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate and her daughter Anna's inheritance, both of which might be threatened if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she took several lovers, and died in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Her {{husband was}} removed from office by the Texas Secession Convention for refusing to swear loyalty to the Confederacy. Margaret became a war-time mother, whose eldest son joined the Confederate Army and was taken {{prisoner}} at the Battle of Shiloh. <b>Her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> {{before the end of}} the war. In her few remaining years, she became the keeper of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer. When she died of yellow fever four and a half years later, Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in Huntsville for fear of contamination, and was instead interred next to her mother on private property.|$|E

5|$|Martha Wise (1884 – June 28, 1971), born Martha Hasel, was an American poisoner and serial killer. After <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> and {{her family}} forced her to end a {{relationship}} with a new lover, Wise retaliated by poisoning seventeen family members, of whom three died, in 1924. She was convicted of one of the murders, despite defense claims that she was mentally ill and that her lover had ordered her to poison her family. The case {{is considered one of the}} most sensational of the era in Ohio, where it occurred.|$|E
5|$|After her defeat, Dallas {{worked in}} private {{business}} {{after her husband}} suffered several strokes {{and was forced to}} retire. Initially, she worked as an associate editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. In 1959, she was hired as an investment banker at Dehaven & Townsend, Crouter & Bodine. As in politics, she was one of a few women working in a male-dominated profession. When <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died,</b> Dallas moved out of their Chestnut Hill home to a retirement community in Delaware County, but continued working until the age of 76. She also remained active on several charitable boards including serving as a commissioner of Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) and in the nonpartisan watchdog group, the Committee of Seventy. She died on January 13, 1983, and was buried alongside her husband in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|As a young woman, Razafindrahety {{married an}} Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony). <b>Her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> {{several years later}} on May 8, 1883, aged 22, leaving Razafindrahety a {{premature}} widow. According to rumor, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony's older brother, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) prime minister. This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between {{the prime minister and}} a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death and the search for her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would be free to marry the prime minister and succeed to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vonnegut {{attended}} Cornell University, but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II, and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, {{with whom he had}} three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> in a train accident.|$|E
5|$|Helena was {{the most}} {{active member of the}} royal family, {{carrying}} out an extensive programme of royal engagements at a time when royalty was not expected to appear often in public. She was also an active patron of charities, {{and was one of the}} founding members of the British Red Cross. She was founding president of the Royal School of Needlework, and president of the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association and the Royal British Nurses' Association. As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale. She became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary in 1916, but <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> a year later. Helena outlived him by six years, and died aged 77 at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923.|$|E
5|$|While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became {{interested}} in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot {{that took place in}} June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised {{the fact that he was}} kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> on 10 May.|$|E

5|$|Cadron-Jetté {{was born}} and raised in Lavaltrie, Quebec, and in 1811 married Jean-Marie Jetté. They had 11 children, several of whom died young. In 1827 she moved to Montreal and in 1832 <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> of cholera. From 1840, in {{collaboration}} with Ignace Bourget (then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montreal), she engaged in the charitable care of unwed mothers. At this time in Montreal, unwed mothers and those associating with them attracted a significant social stigma. Cadron-Jetté operated initially out of her own home and the homes of her children, and later, with the aid of other women, worked from a series of buildings known as the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie. In 1848, she took religious vows, along with several other women, and founded a Roman Catholic religious institute known as the Sisters of Misericorde, dedicated to the care of unwed mothers and their children. In 1849 she obtained formal midwifery qualifications. In 1853 the Misericorde Sisters built a convent on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-André Street, and she lived there the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late twenties and {{gave birth to a}} daughter before <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died,</b> two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|E
5|$|With William Adelin dead, Henry {{had only}} one other {{legitimate}} child, Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Despite Henry taking a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, it became increasingly unlikely {{that he would have}} another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Matilda as his intended heir. Matilda claimed the title of Holy Roman Empress through her marriage to Emperor Henry V, but <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey, the Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy. Geoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry's domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King's personality and reputation.|$|E

5|$|Josephus records three {{short-lived}} {{marriages in}} Berenice's life, the first {{which took place}} sometime between 41 and 43, to Marcus Julius Alexander, brother of Tiberius Julius Alexander and son of Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria. On his early death in 44, {{she was married to}} her father's brother, Herod of Chalcis, with whom she had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. After <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died</b> in 48, she lived with her brother Agrippa for several years and then married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted. According to Josephus, Berenice requested this marriage to dispel rumors that she and her brother were carrying on an incestuous relationship, with Polemon being persuaded to this union mostly on account of her wealth. However the marriage did not last and she soon returned to the court of her brother. Josephus was not the only ancient writer to suggest incestuous relations between Berenice and Agrippa. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, outright claims that they were lovers. Whether this was based on truth remains unknown. Berenice indeed spent much of her life at the court of Agrippa, and by all accounts shared almost equal power. Popular rumors may also have been fueled by the fact that Agrippa himself never married during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>died.</b> As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E
