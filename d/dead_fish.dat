5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or <b>dead</b> <b>fish</b> under water.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using <b>dead</b> <b>fish</b> to fertilize the soil. For {{the first few years}} of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E

They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of <b>dead</b> <b>fish</b> to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{there was}} another major fish kill, with over 200 <b>dead</b> <b>fish</b> found near the Fofanny water {{treatment}} works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny Dam. Measures have been since {{been put in place}} to prevent a similar incident in the future.|$|E

40|$|From the {{collected}} informations and data above {{information and the}} data, {{it appears that the}} cause offish mortality observed between 13 th and 15 th May, 1987 at the Palk Bay side of Mandapam was mainly due to the natural phenomenon resulted by the ecological changes restricted to an area of about 3 - 4 km* between the shore and the coral reef. It was possible that the phytoplankton blooms reported just before the phenomenon and its isolated occurrence immediately after the incidence, and the associated changes in the water quality, the mixing up of the polluted water drained from the Mandapam fish landing centre and its subsequent spread within the reef area due to the prevailing water current would have triggered off an anoxic condition in the water column causing stress in the environment and consequent mortality of the fishes. Further, the absence of any physical and biological symptoms as revealed by the examination of the <b>dead</b> <b>fishes,</b> their gills and the gut contents, and the absence of any report of untoward incidents on the consumption of the <b>dead</b> <b>fishes</b> excluded the possibility of the cause of the reported mortality due to poisoning, pollution or the use of explosives...|$|R

40|$|In late June 2013, {{because of}} sudden and {{unjustified}} increase in mortality of apparent healthy fish in Hasanloo dam cage culture, random sampling was convicted from a live dying and <b>dead</b> <b>fishes.</b> Forty fishes (20 alive and 20 <b>dead</b> <b>fishes)</b> from two cage {{with the weight}} of 200 - 300 gr were sampled. Samples were sent to private factor laboratory ice pieces for evolution. Some physicochemical parameters of Hasanloo dam water including nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, soluble solid materials, temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH was measured.   To investing the probability of bacterial, fungal and parasitic discover outbreaks sample were taken from the kidney, gills and skin of fish. The result of different investing revealed the presence of algal bloom, oxygen shortage, executive problems and fishing net fountain obstruction due to accumulation of planktons and suspended material. Because of increase in light intensity, nutritive substances level, warming of water temperature and static suability of water hydrological status, algal blooming had occurred in Hasanloo dam that not only destroyed the gills of fish but also created competition for soluble oxygen at night with some phytoplankton species causing hypoxia and death of salmon in the breeding farm. The result of general bacterial cutler was negative and mild secondary infection with S aprolegnia species was detected in PGYEA culture.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the parasite load in populations of Heterobranchus longifilis obtained from a cultured environment (pond) and wild habitats. One hundred and twenty fishes were used for the study; 60 each from the cultured environment and wild which were further divided into 30 dead and 30 live fishes for each of the habitat sources. The results showed that 80 % of dead H. longifilis from the pond were infested, as against 73. 3 % of the <b>dead</b> <b>fishes</b> from the wild by different protozoan parasites. Also, 83. 3 % of live H. longifilis from the pond were infested, as against 90 % of the live fishes from the wild. Of the various protozoan parasites observed, I. mutifilis was the most abundant in both the pond (37. 41 %) and wild (36. 40 %). Among the body parts of the sampled fishes from the pond, the gills had the highest parasite load (46 %). Also, the gills had the highest parasite load (44 %) among the body parts of the fishes sampled from the wild. Live fishes from both sources had more protozoan parasites than the <b>dead</b> <b>fishes.</b> Bigger fishes of total length between 25 - 48 cm were more infected than smaller fishes of total length between 19 - 24 cm from both sources. Female fishes had more protozoan parasites than the male counterparts. Also, fishes between 150 - 750 g had more parasite load than the smaller ones of less than 150 g...|$|R

25|$|Death feigning {{may also}} play a role in reproduction, For example, in the nursery web spider, the male {{sometimes}} feigns death to avoid getting eaten by females during mating. In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory cichlid Haplochromis livingstoni lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to {{what appears to be a}} <b>dead</b> <b>fish,</b> whereupon H. livingstoni abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a <b>dead</b> <b>fish</b> {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from the inside out. Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|From November 16 to 20, 2002, {{approximately}} 100 {{striped bass}} (Morone saxatilis), 5 bat rays (Myliobatis californica) and 2 leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) were {{found dead in}} the Flood Control Basin in both Adobe and Matadero Creeks within one mile of the tidegate. The fishkill was attributed to the first large rainstorm washing {{a large amount of}} leaf litter into the basin, leading to eutrophication and low dissolved oxygen. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} <b>dead</b> <b>fish</b> were all large (requiring more oxygen) at 2 to 4 feet long and the mouths and gills of the bass were fully extended open.|$|E
30|$|Nitrogen is the {{nutrient}} that potentially retards phytoplankton production in temperate marine systems (Caraco et al. 1987; Howarth 1988). In shallow coastal lagoons, the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen is ammonium (Serpa et al. 2007). In sediments, there is lesser diffusion of oxygen that primarily reduces rate of nitrification consequently there is low concentrations of nitrates in the sediments. In the present study, {{the emphasis was}} on the available nitrogen {{in the form of}} TKN. The mean TKN of seawater was 73.47  mg/l while that of sediment was 146.22  mg/kg. The TKN concentration was exceptionally higher in all sediment samples. This could also be attributed to flushing of organic matter that originates from anthropogenic sources. Another possible source of TKN could be the disposal of <b>dead</b> <b>fishes</b> in the creek from the fishing communities. In general, both N and P are responsible for increased primary productivity of the creek area.|$|R
50|$|Juveniles {{are often}} {{available}} as aquarium fish despite their eventual large size. In an aquarium {{where they may}} be well-fed, these fish can grow quite rapidly and require tanks of at least 10000 L when fully adult. Weekly feeding is appropriate for this catfish; overfeeding is a common {{cause of death in}} this species. It feeds heavily on live and <b>dead</b> <b>fishes</b> and other meat. Even as a juvenile of only a few inches in length, they are able to swallow many of the more common aquarium fish such as tetras, and it is only appropriate to house this fish with other species of relatively large size. Redtail catfish also have a habit of swallowing inedible objects in the aquarium. Though these are often regurgitated, both the swallowing and the regurgitation can present a problem for the fish, and these objects are best kept out of the aquarium.|$|R
