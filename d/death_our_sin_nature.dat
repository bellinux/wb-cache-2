60|$|And observe it, as his <b>death</b> was for <b>our</b> <b>sin,</b> so his rising {{again was}} for our discharge; for both in {{his death and}} resurrection he {{immediately}} respected our benefits; he died for us, he rose from the dead for us--'He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification' (Rom 4:25).

40|$|Christian {{sacrifice}} {{leads to}} salvation and this cheating {{of death is}} a spiritual &# 13; gift from God. Christ preserves humanity as his <b>death</b> atones for <b>our</b> <b>sins.</b> This notion of sacrifice translates into how the Church is structured. We need only look to Saint Ignatius of Loyola's works, as a primary source, to shed more light about how Christians are protected from death and from Satan. Saint Ignatius, also a Spanish Knight, provides us with European thought regarding the notions of sacrifice. He was also {{the founder of the}} Jesuit Order...|$|R
60|$|FIRST. And, first, I {{begin with}} his resurrection. That God that {{delivered}} him up unto death, {{and that made}} him a curse for sin, that God raised him up from the dead--'But God raised him from the dead' (Acts 3:15, 13:30). Now, considering that at his death he was charged with <b>our</b> <b>sins,</b> and accursed to <b>death</b> for <b>our</b> <b>sins,</b> that justice that delivered him up for them must have amends made to him before he acquits him from them; for there can be no change in justice. Had he found him in <b>our</b> <b>sins</b> in the grave, as he found him in them upon the tree (for he had them in his body on the tree), he had left him there as he had left him upon the tree; yea, he had as surely rotted in the grave, as ever he died on the tree (1 Peter 2:24). But when he visited Christ in the grave, he found him a holy, harmless, undefiled, and spotless Christ, and therefore he raised him up from the dead--'He raised him up from the dead, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that he should be holden of it' (Acts 2:24).|$|R
5000|$|... {{but also}} for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was {{delivered}} over to <b>death</b> for <b>our</b> <b>sins</b> and was raised to life for our justification. [...] This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance {{he had left the}} sins committed beforehand unpunished— he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.|$|R
5000|$|The weekly {{church service}} can {{also include a}} baptism which {{is done in the}} form of immersion, in which the {{candidate}} is submerged completely under the water. Adventist teach that baptism symbolizes and declares our new faith in Christ and our trust in His forgiveness, and buried in the water, we arise to a new life in Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The 15th Fundamental Belief states [...] "By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of <b>our</b> <b>death</b> to <b>sin</b> and of <b>our</b> purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of <b>our</b> <b>sins,</b> and <b>our</b> reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.)." ...|$|R
60|$|What, I say, {{should be}} the reason, but that death {{assaulted}} him with his sting? If Jesus Christ had been to die for his virtues only, doubtless he would have borne it lightly, {{and so he did}} as he died, bearing witness to the truth, 'He endured the cross, despising the shame' (Heb 12:2). How have the martyrs despised death, and, as it were, not been careful of that, having peace with God by Jesus Christ, scorning the most cruel torments that hell and men could devise and invent! but Jesus Christ could not do so, as he was a sacrifice for sin; he died for sin, he was made a curse for us. O my brethren, Christ died many deaths at once, he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death. Look how many thousands shall be saved--so many deaths did Jesus die; yet it was but once he died. He died thy death, and my death, and so many <b>deaths</b> as all <b>our</b> <b>sins</b> deserved who shall be saved from the wrath to come.|$|R

2500|$|By {{these acts}} of salvation, Christ {{provided}} fallen mankind with {{the path to}} escape its fallen nature. The Orthodox Church teaches that through baptism into Christ's <b>death,</b> and <b>our</b> <b>death</b> unto <b>sin</b> in repentance, with God's help we can also rise with Christ into heaven, healed of the breach of our fallen nature and restored to God's grace. To Orthodox Christians, this process is {{what is meant by}} [...] "salvation", which consists of the Christian life. The ultimate goal is theosis – an even closer union with God and closer likeness to God than existed in the Garden of Eden. This very process is called Deification or [...] "God became man that man might become 'god'". However, it must be emphasized that Orthodox Christians do not believe that man literally becomes God in His essence, or a god in his own nature. More accurately, Christ's salvific work enables man in his human nature to become [...] "partakers of the Divine nature" [...] (2 Peter 1:4); that is to say, man is united to God in Christ.|$|R

60|$|Surely, {{here is a}} Gospel, {{and good}} news;--news so good, that it turns what seems to the superstitious the worst of news, into the very best. For it seems at first sight the worst of news that which the ninth Article tells us, that <b>our</b> {{original}} <b>sin,</b> in every person born into this world, deserves God's wrath and damnation. And {{so it would be}} the worst of news, if God were merely a judge, inflicting so much pain and misery for so much sin, without any wish to mend us and save us. But if we remember only the blessed message of this psalm; if we will remember that God is our Father; that God is educating us; that God hath neither parts nor passions; and that, therefore, God's wrath is not different or contrary to his love, but that God's wrath is his love in another shape, punishing men just because he loves men;--then the ninth Article will bring us the very best of news. We shall see that it is the best thing that can possibly befall us, that <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> deserves God's wrath and damnation, and {{that it would have been}} the worst thing which could possibly have befallen us, if <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> had not deserved God's wrath and damnation. For if <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> had not deserved God's anger, then he would not have been angry with it; and then he would have left it alone, instead of condemning it, and dooming it to everlasting destruction as he has done; and then, if <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> had been left alone, we should have been left alone to sin and sin on, growing continually more wicked, till <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> became <b>our</b> ruin. But now God hates <b>our</b> <b>sin,</b> and loves us; and therefore he desires above all things to deliver us from <b>sin,</b> and burn <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> up in his unquenchable fire, that we ourselves may not be burned up therein. For if <b>our</b> <b>sins</b> live, we shall surely die: but if <b>our</b> <b>sins</b> die, then, and then only, shall we live.|$|R

60|$|Answer.--First. That Christ was not {{a sinner}} personally, by acts or doings of his own, is granted; and in this sense {{it is true that}} God did never suppose him to be a sinner, nor punished him as such a sinner, nor did he really, if by really you {{understand}} naturally, become <b>our</b> <b>sin,</b> nor did God ever repute him so. Second. But that Christ stood before God in <b>our</b> <b>sins,</b> and that God did not only suppose him so to stand, but set him in them, put them upon him, and counted them as his own, is so true that he cannot at present be a Christian that denies it--'The Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all' (Isa 53:6; 1 Peter 2:22). Third. So, then, though God did not punish him for sin of his own committing, yet he punished him for <b>sin</b> of <b>our</b> committing--'The just suffered for the unjust' (1 Peter 3:18). Fourth. Therefore it is true, that though Christ did never really become sin of his own, he did really become <b>our</b> <b>sin,</b> did really become <b>our</b> curse for <b>sin.</b> If this be denied, it follows that he became <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> but feignedly, that he was made our curse, or a curse for us but in appearance, show, or in dissimulation; but no such action or work can proceed of the Lord. He did then really lay <b>our</b> <b>sin</b> and his curse upon him for <b>our</b> <b>sin.</b>|$|R
