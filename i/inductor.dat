5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the <b>inductor</b> coils.|$|E

This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the <b>inductor.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{three-phase}} photovoltaic (PV) system, three-phase filter <b>inductors</b> {{are important}} {{part for the}} output electrical power quality. The comparison analyses of three-phase discrete filter <b>inductors</b> and two kinds of three-phase integrated filter <b>inductors</b> in three-phase PV inverter are proposed. Firstly, the three-phase PV inverter operation with discrete filter <b>inductors</b> is analyzed, and the design of discrete filter <b>inductors</b> is given; then operation of the three-phase PV inverter with three-phase integrated five-limb magnetic core filter <b>inductors</b> is analyzed, the design of integrated filter <b>inductors</b> with five-limb magnetic core is given, then the operation of three-phase PV inverter with three-phase integrated three-limb magnetic core filter <b>inductors</b> is analyzed, and the design of integrated filter <b>inductors</b> with three limbs magnetic core is given. The conclusion of comparison between three-phase discrete filter <b>inductors</b> and two kinds of three-phase integrated filter <b>inductors</b> is done; {{it means that the}} three-phase discrete filter <b>inductors</b> can achieve better output electrical power quality with lower power density and three-phase integrated filter <b>inductors</b> can achieve higher power density with lower output electrical power quality.

50|$|Because high-Q <b>inductors</b> are not {{available}} in CMOS, <b>inductors</b> must be off-chip, so adiabatic switching with <b>inductors</b> are limited to designs which use only a few inductors.Quasi-adiabatic stepwise charging avoids <b>inductors</b> entirely by storing recovered energy in capacitors.Stepwise charging (SWC) can use on-chip capacitors.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, coupled <b>inductors</b> {{have been}} applied to {{multiphase}} DC-DC converters. Detailed analysis {{has been done to}} investigate the benefits of directly coupled <b>inductors</b> and inversely coupled <b>inductors,</b> compared to conventional uncoupled <b>inductors.</b> In general, coupled <b>inductors</b> for multiphase DC-DC converters have inherent benefits such as excellent current sharing characteristics, immunity to component tolerance and reduction in current control complexity. Specifically, by employing directly coupled <b>inductors</b> for multiphase DC-DC converters, overall current ripple can be effectively reduced, compared to that of uncoupled <b>inductors.</b> For inversely coupled <b>inductors,</b> phase current ripple can be reduced if operating points and coupling coefficients are carefully chosen. As for small-signal characteristics, inversely coupled <b>inductors</b> have the advantages of broadening the bandwidth of multiphase DC-DC converters and being more immune to load variation at low frequencies. On the other hand, directly coupled <b>inductors</b> have the benefit of low sensitivity to input variation at high frequencies. In addition, the proposed new structure for multiphase DC-DC converters has excellent current sharing performance and reduced current ripple. Computer simulations have been done and hardware prototypes have been built to validate the concepts...|$|R
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an <b>inductor</b> and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only <b>inductor</b> and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inductor</b> is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in a {{magnetic}} field {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{equivalent}} transmission-line circuit for on-chip <b>inductors</b> and derives the quality (Q) factor response {{in terms of}} the transmission-line circuit parameters in closed form. The derived formulas are general and suitable for all kinds of on-chip <b>inductors</b> to account for their frequency dependences of Q factors. For demonstration, a series of asymmetric <b>inductors</b> and another series of same valued symmetric <b>inductors</b> have been fabricated on the same silicon substrate. The measured Q-factor responses for both kinds of <b>inductors</b> agree quite well with the formula predictions. The symmetric <b>inductors</b> have a higher equivalent characteristic impedance so as to correspond to a higher peak Q-factor frequency than the asymmetric <b>inductors.</b> The presented formulas can also uniquely distinguish the improvement in Q-factor responses due to the reduction of conductor loss or dielectric loss...|$|R

5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an <b>inductor</b> (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series <b>inductor,</b> or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E
