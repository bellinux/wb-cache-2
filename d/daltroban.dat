40|$|AIM: Hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction (HPV) causes {{pulmonary hypertension}} {{that may lead}} to right heart failure. We hypothesized that the COX- 2 inhibitor nimesulide and the thromboxane A (2) receptor antagonist <b>daltroban</b> would attenuate HPV. METHODS: Haemodynamic measurements and blood sampling were performed in 18 anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs, with mean ± SEM weights of 31. 3 ± 0. 6 kg, in normoxia (F (i) O (2) ~ 0. 21) and hypoxia (F (i) O (2) ~ 0. 10), before and 5, 15 and 45 min after initiation of right atrial infusion of nimesulide (n = 6) or <b>daltroban</b> (n = 6), respectively, and in six control pigs. RESULTS: Compared with normoxia, hypoxia (n = 18) increased mean pulmonary artery pressure by 15. 8 ± 0. 8 mmHg (P < 0. 001), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 2. 7 ± 0. 3 WU (P < 0. 05) and mean right atrial pressure by 2. 3 ± 0. 3 mmHg (P < 0. 001). In the control pigs, mean pulmonary artery pressure, PVR and mean right atrial pressure remained stable (P = ns) throughout 45 min hypoxia, compared with hypoxia baseline. Nimesulide decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure by 3. 7 ± 1. 3 mmHg after 45 min (P < 0. 013), as well as PVR by 0. 8 ± 0. 2 WU (P < 0. 05), levelling off after 15 min. <b>Daltroban</b> transiently increased (P < 0. 001) mean pulmonary artery pressure and mean right atrial pressure by 7. 2 ± 1. 2 and 2. 7 ± 0. 4 mmHg, respectively, but they returned to hypoxia baseline (P = ns) within 5 min. <b>Daltroban</b> then decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure to after 45 min be 4. 2 ± 1. 6 mmHg lower (P < 0. 005) than at hypoxia baseline. CONCLUSION: COX- 2 inhibition and thromboxane A(2) receptor antagonism attenuate HPV by decreasing mean pulmonary artery pressure by approximately 10 - 11 %, as measured 45 min after initiation of nimesulide or <b>daltroban</b> infusion respectively...|$|E
40|$|Thromboxane, {{prostacyclin}} {{and their}} ratio could {{play an important}} role in the ischemic liver injury. To study this hypothesis, thromboxane and prostacyclin were measured by RIA after incubation of liver tissues removed during and after an ischemia of 90 min in male Wistar rats. The thromboxane to prostacyclin ratio increases during this period. In order to examine if this change could influence the survival rate of animals submitted to the same period of ischemia, drugs able to reduce the relative predominance of thromboxane were infused. The survival rate was not modified by administration of Iloprost or <b>Daltroban,</b> the antagonist of the thromboxane receptors. By contrast, imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase, significantly increased the survival rate. The same result was obtained with the administration of <b>Daltroban</b> plus Iloprost, suggesting that the reduction of thromboxane action associated with the increase of PGI 2 level reduces the ischemic injury...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to assess the amelioration by two antithrombotic drugs of radiation nephropathy in mice. Mouse kidneys were given split-dose irradiation to total doses between 17 and 22 Gy. A first group of animals was given acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in drinking water, a second received <b>daltroban,</b> a thromboxane A 2 /prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist, and a third received normal tap water, serving as a control. Both antithrombotic drugs were started 1 week prior to the irradiation and were given throughout the whole follow-up period. Renal function was assessed every 4 weeks from 18 weeks {{after the start of}} irradiation onwards by measuring the [51 Cr] EDTA retention and haematocrit. The dose of ASA (600 mg/kg/day) caused an inhibition of thromboxane A 2 and prostacyclin biosynthesis to 19 +/- 10 (mean +/- SEM) and 85 +/- 22 %, respectively, as assessed by the excretion of their urinary metabolites. A significant sparing effect on the renal function after irradiation was observed in the ASA-treated animals. Using the latency time to reach 4 % residual plasma activity of [51 Cr] EDTA, a dose-modifying factor of 1. 19 was calculated. No effect was seen with <b>daltroban</b> (10 mg/kg/day). Histopathological analysis of the kidneys at 12 months after irradiation demonstrated a substantially lower level of damage in the ASA-treated mice compared with daltroban-treated and radiation-only animals. These data indicate that long-term treatment with ASA is effective in reducing renal functional impairment after irradiatio...|$|E
40|$|Single-flush {{perfusion}} with Euro-Collins solution (ECS), after pretreatment with prostaglandin E 1 or prostacyclin, is at most centers {{the standard}} procedure for preservation of lungs for transplantation. In a previous study, {{we showed that}} the high potassium content of ECS causes strong pulmonary vasoconstriction at temperatures higher than 20 degrees C. In the present study, five drugs used as pretreatment and added to the perfusate were compared {{for their ability to}} counteract ECS-induced constriction of porcine pulmonary arteries: papaverine reduced the vasoconstrictive effect by 92 % +/- 4 %; nifedipine, by 62 % +/- 6 %; the thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist <b>daltroban,</b> by 15 % +/- 4 %; and prostaglandin E 1, by 12 % +/- 4 %. On the other hand, prostacyclin not only failed to reduce ECS-induced vasoconstriction but at the highest concentration tested, enhanced it by 37 % +/- 7 %. The combination of papaverine (10 (- 4) mol/L) and nifedipine (10 (- 6. 5) mol/L) was the only pretreatment to abolish ECS-induced vasoconstriction; moreover, it has no adverse effect on endothelial function. Neither prostaglandin E 1 nor prostacyclin effectively counteracts ECS-induced vasoconstriction, though they may have other beneficial effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a relatively common complication of heparin therapy, {{is not yet}} fully understood. We found that pretreatment of platelets with AR-C 66096 (formerly FPL 66096), a specific platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist, at a concentration of 100 to 200 nmol/L that blocked ADP-dependent platelet aggregation, resulted in complete loss of platelet aggregation responses to HIT sera. AR-C 66096 also totally inhibited HIT serum-induced dense granule release, as judged by measurement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release. Apyrase, added to platelets at a concentration that had only minor effects on thrombin- or arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, also blocked completely HIT serum-induced platelet aggregation. Furthermore, AR-C 66096 inhibited platelet aggregation and ATP release induced by cross-linking Fc gamma RIIA with specific antibodies. These data show that released ADP and the platelet ADP receptor play {{a pivotal role in}} HIT serum-induced platelet activation/aggregation. The thromboxane receptor inhibitor, <b>Daltroban,</b> had no effect on HIT serum-induced platelet activation whereas GPIIb-IIIa antagonists blocked platelet aggregation but had only a moderate effect on HIT serum-induced dense granule release. Pretreatment of platelets with chondroitinases but not with heparinases resulted in concentration dependent inhibition of HIT serum-induced platelet aggregation. These novel data relating to the mechanism of platelet activation induced by HIT sera suggest that the possibility should be examined that ADP receptor antagonists or compounds that inhibit ADP release may be effective as therapeutic agents for the prevention or treatment of complications associated with heparin therapy...|$|E
40|$|Prostanoids are lipid {{compounds}} that mediate {{a variety of}} physiological and pathological functions in almost all body tissues and organs. Thromboxane (TX) A 2 is a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and it has ulcerogenic activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Overdose or chronic use of a high dose of acetaminophen (N-acetyl-paminophenol, APAP) is {{a major cause of}} acute liver failure in the Western world. We investigated whether TXA 2 plays a role in host response to toxic effect of APAP. CBA/H Zg mice of both sexes were intoxicated with a single lethal or high sublethal dose of APAP, which was administered to animals by oral gavage. The toxicity of APAP was determined by observing the survival of mice during 48 h, by measuring concentration of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) in plasma 20 - 22 h after APAP administration and by liver histology. The results have shown that anti-thromboxane (TX) B 2 antibodies (anti-TXB 2) and a selective inhibitor of thromboxane (TX) synthase, benzylimidazole (BZI), were significantly hepatoprotective, while a selective thromboxane receptor (TPR) antagonist, <b>daltroban,</b> was slightly protective in this model of acute liver injury. A stabile metabolite of TXA 2, TXB 2, and a stabile agonist of TPR, U- 46619, had no influence on APAP-induced liver damage. Our findings suggest that TXA 2 has a pathogenic role in acute liver toxicity induced with APAP, which was highly abrogated by administration of anti-TXB 2. According to our results, this protection is mediated, at least in part, through decreased production of TXB 2 by liver fragments ex vivo...|$|E
40|$|Prostanoids are lipid {{compounds}} that mediate variety of physiological and pathological functions {{in almost all}} body tissues and organs. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), which is synthesized by many cell types, and prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2), which is synthesized by the vascular endothelium, has a strong cytoprotective and vasodilatory effects in the gastrointestinal tract and in several other tissues and cells. Thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) is a major product of arachidonate metabolism in platelets. It is a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and it shows ulcerogenic activity in gastrointestinal tract. These observations prompted us to investigate whether PGE 2, PGI 2 or TxA 2 {{play a role in}} host defence to toxic effect of acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP), which overdose or chronic use of a high dose is a major cause of acute liver failure in the western world. CBAT 6 T 6, C 57 Bl/ 6 and (CBAT 6 T 6 xC 57 Bl/ 6) F 1 satybrid mice of both sexes were intoxicated with a single lethal (250 - 300 mg/kg) or high sublethal (150 - 200 mg/kg) dose of APAP, which was administered to animals by oral gavage. Stabile analogues of PGE 2 (dm-PGE 2, 0, 2 mg/kg) and PGI 2 (iloprost, 0, 2 or 0, 5 mg/kg), PGI 2 (10 μg/kg), inhibitors of PGE 2 production through the selective modulation of mPGES- 1 expression (CAY 10526, 2 mg/kg), PGI receptor (CAY 10441, 2 mg/kg) and TxA receptor (<b>daltroban,</b> 5 mg/kg), TxB 2 (2 mg/kg) and inhibitor of TxA 2 -synthase – benzyl imidazole (BZI, 50 mg/kg) were given to mice intraperitoneally (i. p.) 30 min before or 2 h after APAP administration. Anti-TxB 2 antibodies (anti-TxB 2, 40 μg/kg) were given i. p. 3 h before, while stabile analogue of TxA 2 (U- 46619, 0, 2 and 0, 8 mg/kg) was injected into mice intravenously (i. v.) 30 min before APAP. The toxicity of APAP was determined by observing the survival of mice during 48 h, by measuring concentration of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) in plasma 20 - 22 h after APAP administration and by liver histology. The results have shown that PGE 2 and PGI 2 exhibit a strong hepatoprotective effect when they are given to mice either before or after APAP, while CAY 10526 and CAY 10441 demonstrated mainly the opposite effect. Iloprost had no significant influence on APAP toxicity. Anti-TxB 2 and BZI were significantly hepatoprotective and <b>daltroban</b> showed mainly the same (but non significant) action on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. TxB 2 and U- 46619 were ineffective in this model of acute liver injury. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to NF-κB revealed that administration of dm-PGE 2 down regulated, in a significant manner, the activation of NF-κB and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of hepatocytes. The present results also showed that PGE 2 significantly diminished expression of iNOS in hepatocytes and reduced NO production, which was reflected by lower (albeit statistically non significant) nitrite/nitrate concentration in plasma. Our findings support the hypothesis that TxA 2 has a pathogenic role in liver toxicity induced with APAP, while PGE 2 and PGI 2 have a cytoprotective effect and are involved in the defence of the organism to noxious effects of xenobiotics on liver. According to our results, this protection is mediated, at least partially, through down regulation of NF-κB activation and iNOS expression. Therefore, further work is needed to elucidate precise mechanisms underlying cytoprotective effects of PGs in acute liver injury...|$|E
