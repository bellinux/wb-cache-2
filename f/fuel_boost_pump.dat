5000|$|Boost Pump - If the {{aircraft}} requires the <b>fuel</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> {{to be on}} for takeoff operations, this is the reminder to turn on this switch or otherwise enable the pump or check {{that it has been}} enabled, ...|$|E
50|$|Fuel Primer Pump - A {{manual pump}} {{to add a}} small amount of fuel at the {{cylinder}} intakes to assist in starting a cold engine. Fuel injected engines do not have this control. For fuel injected engines, a <b>fuel</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> is used to prime the engine prior to start.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>Boost</b> <b>Pump</b> Switch - Controls the {{operation}} of the auxiliary electric fuel pump to provide fuel to the engine before it starts or in case of failure of the engine powered fuel pump. Some large airplanes have a fuel system that allows the flight crew to jettison or dump the fuel. When operated, the boost pumps in the fuel tanks pump the fuel to the dump chutes or jettison nozzles and overboard to atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} the vapors ignited due to damaged wiring, as no bomb, {{incendiary}} device or detonator {{had been found}} at the scene. The airline had fitted logo lights after delivery which required passing additional wires through the vapor seals in the fuel tanks. The NTSB recommended to the FAA that an Airworthiness Directive be issued requiring inspections of the <b>fuel</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pumps,</b> float switch and wiring looms as signs of chafing had been found. The FAA declined to issue the Airworthiness Directive.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain's decision not to follow approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Different output pressure settings on the <b>fuel</b> <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> coupled with the open crossfeed valve resulted in both engines drawing fuel from the left tank. All of the fuel from the airplane's left tank that was not used by the engines was transferred into the right tank due to the pressure differential between the <b>boost</b> <b>pumps.</b> During the airplane's descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank became exhausted. Both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the exhausted left tank into the fuel system, resulting in a dual-engine flameout.|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two <b>fuel</b> tank <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|R
50|$|In the APU, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> <b>boosted</b> the {{hydrazine}} {{pressure and}} fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed {{back over the}} gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the fuel pump, its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the fuel pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the fuel pump outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump.|$|R
40|$|During the Titan Centaur 1 {{test flight}} a failure {{involving}} {{at least one}} of the Centaur propellant <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> occurred. Also, neither of the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> speed instruments indicated pump rotation. Accelerometer data from the Titan Centaur 1 flight failure were analyzed using power spectral density methods to determine <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> speed during attempted starts of the Centaur. The technique was demonstrated on a reference flight. The hydrogen <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> speed transient was determined for the TC- 1 flight. Other trends are seen in the data. However, these are not believed to be the oxygen <b>boost</b> <b>pump.</b> Discussion of data enhancement techniques is also presented...|$|R
50|$|Feb 11, 1974: Titan-Centaur; <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> failed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> so to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation. For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.|$|R
50|$|Most Learjet 25 {{aircraft}} were {{fitted with}} a fuselage tank. The fuselage tank can be filled by the wing <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> through the transfer line and the fuel transfer valve. When the tank is full, a float switch de-energizes the wing <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> and closes the valve. During fuel transfer, the fuselage tank transfer pump pumps fuel into the both wing tanks.|$|R
5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> would be turned off.|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} {{mission was}} conducted to perform experiments demonstrating increased operational capabilities. The Centaur propellant behavior, the effects of reduced tank pressurization levels, and a propellant duct prechill technique were successfully evaluated. The major flight data results show that: (1) the propellants can be controlled with short collection times, even with a simulated H 202 engine failure; (2) extensive tank ventings can be safely performed; (3) the Centaur <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> can perform adequately with no LH 2 tank pressurization, and with low LO 2 tank pressurization levels; (4) the duct prechill technique is {{an effective way to}} reduce <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> cavitation and improve engine chilldown; and (5) the Centaur <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> should be completely stopped prior to an engine start sequence...|$|R
40|$|The Centaur LOX <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was {{subjected}} to both the simulated Titan Centaur proof flight and confidence demonstration vibration test levels. For each test level, both sinusoidal and random vibration tests were conducted along {{each of the three}} orthogonal axes of the pump and turbine assembly. In addition to these tests, low frequency longitudinal vibration tests for both levels were conducted. All tests were successfully completed without damage to the <b>boost</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the desirability of replacing the hydrogen peroxide settling system on the Centaur D- 1 S with a capillary acquisition system. A comprehensive screening {{was performed to}} select the most promising capillary device fluid acquisition, thermal conditioning, and fabrication techniques. Refillable start baskets and bypass feed start tanks were selected for detailed design. Critical analysis areas were settling and refilling, start sequence development with an initially dry <b>boost</b> <b>pump,</b> and cooling the fluid delivered to the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> {{in order to provide}} necessary net position suction head (NPSH). Design drawings were prepared for the start basket and start tank concepts for both LO 2 and LH 2 tanks. System comparisons indicated that the start baskets using wicking for thermal conditioning, and thermal subcooling for <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> NPSH, are the most desirable systems for future development...|$|R
40|$|Studies included: {{selection}} of <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> designs for low NPSH operation and generation of associated programmatic data; evaluation of OTV engine operation at intermediate thrust levels and impact on programmatics; and assessments of OTV engine operation at idle-mode thrusts under conditions experienced during aerobraking maneuvers of the ABOTV. As {{a result of}} the studies, it was recommended that the original OTV <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> designs be used without change for low NPSH operation. Intermediate thrust operation is feasible for both the expander cycle and staged combustion cycles...|$|R
50|$|Each {{wing tank}} often {{has its own}} {{electric}} <b>boost</b> <b>pump,</b> and each engine has its own mechanical pump, replicating the fuel system described above for the single engine.|$|R
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was turned off, any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{performance}} of several configurations of hubless inducers with a hydrodynamically similar conventional inducer and to demonstrate the performance of a full flow hydraulic turbine driven inducer <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> using these inducers. A <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> of this type consists of an inducer connected to a hydraulic turbine with a high speed rotor located in between. All the flow passes through the inducer, rotor, and hydraulic turbine, then into the main pump. The rotor, which is attached to the main pump shaft, provides the input power to drive the hydraulic turbine which, in turn, drives the inducer. The inducer, rotating at a lower speed, develops the necessary head to prevent rotor cavitation. The rotor speed is consistent with present main engine liquid hydrogen pump designs and the overall <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> head rise is sufficient to provide adequate main pump suction head. This system would have the potential for operating at lower liquid hydrogen tank pressures...|$|R

40|$|In some liquid-propellant rocket engines, the liquid-oxygen <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> {{is driven}} by a turbine that is powered by {{high-pressure}} gaseous oxygen. Once it exits the turbine, this gaseous oxygen can be salvaged by injecting it into the subcooled liquid oxygen exiting the <b>boost</b> <b>pump.</b> If the main LOX pump is to function correctly under these circumstances, complete condensation of the gaseous oxygen must quickly follow its injection into the boost-pump discharge. The current investigation uses steam and water in a simple rig that allows the condensation process to be visualized and quantified. This paper offers dimensionless-parameter correlations of the data and trends observed...|$|R
5000|$|All M20s store fuel in two {{separate}} [...] "wet wing" [...] tanks, which {{are located in the}} inboard sections of each wing. Fuel is driven from the tank to the injectors or carburetor by an engine-driven pump, backed up with an electric <b>boost</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{performance}} optimized {{engine system}} {{design for a}} man-rated advanced LOX/hydrogen expander cycle engine was investigated. The data are presented in tables, figures, and drawings. The following categories of data for the advanced expander cycle engine are presented: engine operating specification and pressure schedule; engine system layout drawing; major component layout drawings, including thrust chamber and nozzle, extendible nozzle actuating mechanism and seal, LOX turbopump, LOX <b>boost</b> <b>pump,</b> hydrogen turbopump, hydrogen <b>boost</b> <b>pump,</b> and propellant control valves; engine performance and service life prediction; engine weight; and engine envelope. The data represent updates based upon current results from the design and analyses tasks performed under contract. Futher iterations in the designs and data can be expected as the advanced expander cycle engine design matures...|$|R
50|$|The high pressure, {{high flow}} water {{injection}} pumps are placed {{near to the}} de-oxygenation tower and <b>boosting</b> <b>pumps.</b> They fill {{the bottom of the}} reservoir with the filtered water to push the oil towards the wells like a piston. The result of the injection is not quick, it needs time.|$|R
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|R
40|$|The design {{characteristics}} of the baseline engine configuration of the advanced expander cycle engine are described. Several aspects of engine optimization are considered which directly impact {{the design of the}} baseline thrust chamber. Four major areas of the power cycle optimization are emphasized: main turbine arrangement; cycle engine source; high pressure <b>pump</b> design; and <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> drive...|$|R
40|$|An oxygen <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> is {{described}} {{which can be}} used to charge the high pressure oxygen tank in the extravehicular activity equipment from spacecraft supply. The only interface with the spacecraft is the + 06 6. 205 Pa supply line. The breadboard study results and oxygen tank survey are summarized and the results of the flight-type prototype design and analysis are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{areas of}} liquid and vapor flow were analyzed and experimentally evaluated; 1) the refilling of capillary devices with settled liquid, and 2) vapor flow across wetted screens. These investigations resulted in: 1) {{the development of}} a versatile computer program that was successfully correlated with test data and used to predict Centaur D- 1 S LO 2 and LH 2 start basket refilling; 2) {{the development of a}} semi-empirical model that was only partially correlated with data due to difficulties in obtaining repeatable test results. Also, a comparison was made to determine the best propellant management system for the Centaur D- 1 S vehicle. The comparison identified the basline Centaur D- 1 S system (using pressurization, <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> and propellant settling) as the best candidate based on payload weight penalty. However, other comparison criteria and advanced mission condition were identified where pressure fed systems, thermally subcooled <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> and capillary devices would be selected as attractive alternatives...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine if ice formation in the Centaur vehicle liquid oxygen <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> turbine could prevent rotation of the pump {{and whether or not}} this phenomenon could have been the failure mechanism for the Titan/Centaur vehicle TC- 1. The investigation consisted of a series of tests done in the LeRC Space Power Chamber Facility to evaluate evaporative cooling behavior patterns in a turbine {{as a function of the}} quantity of water trapped in the turbine and as a function of the vehicle ascent pressure profile. It was found that evaporative freezing of water in the turbine housing, due to rapid depressurization within the turbine during vehicle ascent, could result in the formation of ice that would block the turbine and prevent rotation of the <b>boost</b> <b>pump.</b> But for such icing conditions to exist it would be necessary to have significant quantities of water in the turbine and/or its components, and the turbine housing temperature would have to be colder than 40 F at vehicle liftoff...|$|R
40|$|Data are {{presented}} from a systems postflight {{analysis of the}} Centaur Launch Vehicle and Helios. Also given is a comparison of data from preflight analyses. Topics examined are: (1) propellant behavior; (2) helium usage; (3) propellant tank pressurization; (4) propellant tank thermodynamics; (5) component heating; thermal control; and thermal protection system; (6) main engine system; (7) H 2 O 2 consumption; (8) <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> post-meco performance; and (9) an overview of other systems...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to determine the dynamic characteristics of the Centaur/RL- 10 oxygen and hydrogen feedlines. The fundamental-mode resonant frequencies were determined by applying power spectral methods to noise-generated data from hot firings of the RL- 10 engine. The effect of net positive suction pressure of the main feed pumps on resonant frequency characteristics {{was determined to be}} a straight-line relation. Power spectral methods were also used to determine the dynamic characteristics of the <b>boost</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} solution {{procedure for}} time-accurate solutions of Incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is obtained. Artificial compressibility method requires a fast convergence scheme. Pressure projection method is efficient when small time-step is required. The number of sub-iteration is reduced significantly when Poisson solver employed with the continuity equation. Both computing time and memory usage are reduced (at least 3 times). Other work includes Multi Level Parallelism (MLP) of INS 3 D, overset connectivity for the validation case, experimental measurements, and computational model for <b>boost</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
50|$|On April 25, 2005, Valero {{agreed to}} buy Premcor, Inc., for $8 billion in cash and stock to become the largest U.S. refinery, as record prices for {{gasoline}} and other <b>fuel</b> <b>boosted</b> profits.

50|$|The {{failure was}} {{traced to the}} Centaur <b>boost</b> <b>pumps,</b> but the cause was still unclear, thought likely to be either ice or debris. To reduce the chance of another similar failure, pre-launch {{procedures}} to verify Centaur's pumps were free and unobstructed were put in place. It took nearly four years to trace {{the cause of the}} failure, which was an improperly-installed mounting bracket inside the LOX tank. This bracket held a LOX regulator in place and the technician responsible for installing it had found that the normal tool used to screw bolts into place was too short to reach the bracket. He thus used a slightly longer socket wrench which gave him more reach. The technician had since retired and failed to inform his successor about this. The new technician thus attempted to attach the bolt with the wrench specified in the assembly instructions, which was too short and prevented him from screwing it into place properly. The bolt came loose, fell off, and got sucked into one of the LOX <b>boost</b> <b>pumps,</b> jamming it and preventing it from operating. Despite the failure, at least one important goal was accomplished in that the bulging Centaur payload shroud was proven to be aerodynamically stable in flight and had jettisoned properly and on schedule.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} in the space power facility to investigate {{the failure of the}} Centaur oxidizer <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> during the Titan/Centaur proof flight February 11, 1974. The three basic objectives of the tests were: (1) demonstrate if an evaporative freezing type failure mechanism could have prevented the pump from operating, (2) determine if steam from the exhaust of one of the attitude control engine could have entered a pump seal cavity and caused the failure, and (3) obtain data on the heating effects of the exhaust plume from a hydrogen peroxide attitude control engine...|$|R
