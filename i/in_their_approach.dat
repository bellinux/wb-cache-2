However, Thunderbird 6 would also receive a less-than-enthusiastic public reception, spelling the end of Thunderbirds as a film and television franchise until the arrival of the live-action adaptation, Thunderbirds, almost four decades later in 2004.|$|E

25|$|A fourth {{difference}} suggested, {{relates to}} the acceptability of moderation within Jewish law. Both Modern Orthodoxy and Ultra Orthodoxy regard Halakha as divine in origin, and as such, no position is assumed without justification in the Shulchan Aruch and in the Acharonim. The movements differ, however, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to strictures (chumras) and leniencies (kulas).|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{patients}} and their doctors (GPs) have different perceptions of the efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. Patients consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main etiologic dietary factor. It {{has been suggested that}} Dutch GPs explore the patients' expectations and potentially incorporate these <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to IBS patients.|$|E
25|$|The works not {{assigned}} {{as a part}} of Cassiodorus's {{educational program}} must be examined critically. Because he had been working under the newly dominant power of the Ostrogoths, the writer demonstrably alters the narrative of history for the sake of protecting himself. The same could easily be said about his ideas, which were presented as non-threatening <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to peaceful meditation and its institutional isolationism.|$|E

25|$|PERT and CPM {{are very}} similar <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> but still present some differences. CPM is used for {{projects}} that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity {{will be carried out}} are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s Interactive fiction {{was mainly}} written with C-like languages, such as TADS 2 and Inform 6. A number of systems for writing {{interactive}} fiction now exist. The most popular remain Inform, TADS, or ADRIFT, {{but it should}} be noted that they diverged <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to IF-writing during the 2000s, giving today's IF writers an objective choice. By 2006 IFComp, most games were written for Inform, with a strong minority of games for TADS and ADRIFT, followed by a small number of games for other systems.|$|E

25|$|Administrative law arose as a {{response}} to the advent of the administrative state. It is a 20th-century product of English administrative law, which Singapore inherited at independence. Like the English system, Singapore does not have a separate system of specialist administrative courts as is the case in most civil law jurisdictions. Singapore courts are generally conservative <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> towards administrative law, drawing heavily from English case law in some respects but not engaging in innovative elaboration of the existing heads of judicial review.|$|E
25|$|There are {{considerable}} variations between countries <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to sexual violence. Some countries have far-reaching legislation and legal procedures, {{with a broad}} definition of rape that includes marital rape, and with heavy penalties for those convicted and a strong response in supporting victims. Commitment to preventing or controlling sexual violence is also reflected in an emphasis on police training and an appropriate allocation of police resources to the problem, in the priority given to investigating cases of sexual assault, and in the resources made available to support victims and provide medico-legal services.|$|E
25|$|Historically, MDs and DOs {{significantly}} differed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> {{to medical}} treatment. Allopathic medicine was primarily based on scientific practices. In contrast, osteopathic medicine {{was founded in}} the mid-nineteenth century on the premise of healing the body through osteopathic musculoskeletal manipulation. MD and DO schools can also be distinguished by a relative lack of scientific and clinical research at DO schools. The coursework at MD and DO schools is similar, with the most notable exception being that DO students are taught osteopathic manipulative medicine.|$|E

In essence, both see danger in an expanded state and share the same ideological foundations...|$|R
25|$|Another {{less clear}} {{difference}} between assemblies lies <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approaches</b> to collaborating with other Christians. Many Open Brethren will hold gospel meetings, youth events, or other activities {{in partnership with}} non-Brethren Evangelical Christian churches. More conservative Open Brethren—and perhaps the majority of Exclusive Brethren—tend not to support activities outside their own meetings.|$|R

25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of Millionaires the band chose to start anew <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to their next album, working with Eno once again. They {{spent most of}} 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour {{in the autumn of}} that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, Pleased To Meet You, was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.|$|E
25|$|As long {{as these}} two {{criteria}} are satisfied, the data replicas converge (with additional constraints) after all operations are executed at all sites. There {{is no need}} to enforce a total order of execution for the sake of achieving convergence. Their approach is generally to first identify and prove sufficient conditions for a few transformation functions, and then design a control procedure to ensure those sufficient conditions. This way the control procedure and transformation functions work synergistically to achieve correctness, i.e., causality and admissibility preservation. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach,</b> there {{is no need to}} satisfy transformation properties such as TP2 because it does not require that the (inclusive) transformation functions work in all possible cases.|$|E
25|$|His {{views on}} {{language}} are polemical <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> to word and structure formation. Stavans believes that dictionaries and language academies are buffers whose improbable {{function is to}} provide continuity for a language but suggests that such continuity, especially {{in the age of}} electronic communication, is fatuous. He accuses the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language in Madrid of colonialism, among other things. He has also studied the Iberian conquest of the Americas in the 16th century from a linguistic perspective. Translation, for Stavans, represents appropriation. He defined modernity as “a translated way of life” and has written and lectured on the role translators perform as communicating vessels across epochs and habitats.|$|E
30|$|It is {{somewhat}} {{hopeful that the}} most cited articles {{of the last two}} decades and include educational issues <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>approaches</b> are those that speak about personalisation based on the choices of the learner and not the machine for the learner, although it is true that this vision could be insignificant because of the type of final sampling used.|$|R
