50|$|When {{the first}} Culture stories appeared, science fiction was {{dominated}} by cyberpunk, a pessimistic subgenre that worried about, but offered no solutions for, the offshoring of jobs to countries with lower costs or less strict regulations, the increasing power of corporations and the threats to privacy posed by computer networks. The Culture stories are space opera, with certain elements that are free from scientific realism, and Banks uses this freedom extravagantly in order {{to focus on the}} human and political aspects of his universe; he even rejects the inevitability of capitalism, which both cyberpunk and earlier space operas had assumed, in creating an anarcho-communist society as the primary civilization of <b>focus.</b> <b>Space</b> opera had peaked in the 1930s, but started to decline as magazine editors such as John W. Campbell demanded more realistic approaches. By the 1960s many space operas were satires on earlier styles, such as Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat and Bill, the Galactic Hero stories, while televised and film space operas such as Star Trek and Star Wars were thought to have dumbed down the subgenre. The Culture stories did much to revive space opera.|$|E

In this paper, we demonstrate a high-efficiency cascaded-beamsplitter array for producing temporally decorrelated beamlets.

In this squib, we present a critical analysis of the cache model and of Walker's supporting evidence from anaphora in discourses with interruptions and from informationally redundant utterances. We argue that the cache model is underdetermined in several ways that are crucial to a comparison of the two models and conclude that Walker has not established the superiority of the cache model. We also argue that psycholinguistic evidence does not support the cache model over the focus stack model. 1...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} discourse structure is {{its effect on the}} search for the antecedents of anaphoric expressions. We tested the predictions in this regard of theories assuming that the structure of a discourse depends on its intentional structure, such as Grosz and Sidner's theory. We used a corpus of tutorial dialogues independently annotated according to Relational Discourse Analysis (RDA), a theory of discourse structure merging ideas from Grosz and Sidner's theory with proposals from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Using as our metrics the accessibility of anaphoric antecedents and the reduction in ambiguity brought about by a particular theory, we found support for Moser and Moore's proposal that among the units of discourse assumed by an RST-like theory, only those expressing an intentional `core' (in the RDA sense) should be viewed as constraining the search for antecedents; units only expressing informational relations should not introduce separate <b>focus</b> <b>spaces.</b> We also found that the best compromise between accessibility and ambiguity ('perplexity') reduction is a model in which the <b>focus</b> <b>spaces</b> associated with embedded cores and embedded contributors remain on the stack until the RDA-segment in which they occur is completed, and discuss the implications of this finding for a stack-based theory...|$|R
30|$|In the paper, we {{will report}} {{a kind of}} nanopillar array with a pillar {{diameter}} much smaller than Abbe's diffraction limitation by visible CW laser direct lithography technology. A 532 -nm CW laser beam, which is modified by a phase mask to generate a nanolevel dark core in the <b>focus</b> <b>space,</b> is proposed and applied in nanopillar/pore fabricating. The nanopillar array is obtained when the laser beam is irradiated to the positive tone photoresist, while nanopore will be generated with a negative tone photoresist. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that nanopillar arrays are fabricated with a spatial donut shape, structured visible CW laser. Experimental results are measured by AFM, and the distortion and the inconsistency of nanopatterns are analyzed with theoretical simulation. This preliminary work explores a novel, easy, and effective method of maskless CW laser direct writing technology to carry out functional nanopillar/pore arrays.|$|E

40|$|The {{large size}} of many volume data sets often {{prevents}} visualization algorithms from providing interactive rendering. The use of hierarchical data structures can ameliorate {{this problem by}} storing summary information to prevent useless exploration of regions of little or no current interest within the volume. This paper discusses research into {{the use of the}} octree hierarchical data structure when the regions of current interest can vary during the application, and are not known a priori. Octrees are well suited to the six-sided cell structure of many volumes. A new space-eÆcient design is introduced for octree representations of volumes whose resolutions are not conveniently a power of two; octrees following this design are called branch-on-need octrees (BONOs). Also, a caching method is described that essentially passes information between octree neighbors whose visitation times may be quite dierent, then discards it when its useful life is over. Using the application of octrees to isosurface generation as a <b>focus,</b> <b>space</b> and time comparisons for octree-based versus more traditional " methods are presented...|$|E
40|$|The thesis aims at {{creating}} a restoration {{study of the}} Rajhrad Abbey monastery gardens. To create the most valuable design, values and conflicts were established {{in the region as}} well as opportunities and risks. After a stay in the monastery, author got to know monks everyday life and gained a more complete overview of the demands and needs of the Benedictines on the premises. The aim is to create a harmonious functioning self-sustaining space, filled with features and variability. The space in which monks will be able to spend the time praying and working while visitors will relax and open their souls. The combination of material and spiritual world reaches its peak here. The design respects genius loci eminently, in the areas where it was kept. In places where their identity was changed by inappropriate intervention, the author tries to bring back or restore original values. Analysis confirmed the uniqueness of the place and its importance. The design then works with synchronization and harmonization of content in space and their overall interconnection and harmony. Several very different areas conceal number of quite varying potentials and contents. Thus, the same amount of different approaches to the solution. Historical values and compositional elements are maintained and respected. A major theme is the restoration of the original Santini's entry, which completely changes visitor's perception of the space. The place full of meditation, prayer, relaxation, peace and tranquility will certainly find its place in today's stress-filled time. Location near the city of Brno is perfect for weekend tourists who leave behind the hustle and confusion of big city and working duties.

40|$|Homelessness {{arises from}} a {{multitude}} of circumstantial conditions, which are as many as there are homeless people. If we strip away all the superfluous baggage that sometimes gets associated {{with the issue of}} homelessness, we see that it is simply about survival in the most basic way. I am certainly not advocating that the complex way in which our society lives {{is the best way to}} live and that everyone should conform to those standards. I would merely suggest that those who want to participate, should have the opportunity or the chance to develop the necessary skills to do so. My thesis exploration is "How my architecture can strengthen the notion of education?". Beyond that, it is about creating spaces of possibility! The program is developed for a facility that literally provides a bridge for the homeless to main stream society. It has also been developed in a rather open ended manner as to suggest a variety of possibilities for the designer under the assumption that if this particular project were to be built, and deemed successful, the program would leave enough latitude to be used at other locations around the city and state as a prototype. Finally, I would hope that the program be used to develop architecture that provokes looking at the future differently. In these spaces it is possible to imagine ourselves dreaming, moving forward and beyond the limits and confines of our fixed location. The project itself will result in a series of buildings that will house the homeless during a period in which they will be learning the skills that will afford them the opportunity to leave homelessness behind. The philosophical stance that the program is derived around is that rather than give a man a fish to ease his hunger, you teach him to fish so he can feed himself. The building(s) is not intended to be a shelter or "flop" house. At the stage the clients come to this facility they have already gone through extensive screening to make sure that they are mentally, physically, and emotionally willing and able to go through an intensive job skill training and job placement program. There is a growing sentiment in America that the millions of Federally Funded tax dollars that are spent on the homeless each year does little to prevent it and is doing nothing to slow the alarming rate at which it is growing. "Millions of our city and state tax and charitable dollars have been wasted. Agencies know that socks, blankets, shelter and dinner do nothing to stop the alarming growth rate of this plight, but they continue to keep asking for these accommodating tools and funding without any accountability. " 1 Because of the tremendous numbers of people the local shelters are dealing with, and because of the immediate need for shelter, clothing, and food, shelters continue to use their funds for accommodative tools. The program for this project was designed to facilitate, in an innovative manner, an education center for the client. What is unique about the program is that it does offer accountability that can be measured in a real and tangible way, with the graduation of one of it's clientele into the job market and into the tax paying society that funds programs like this. The spaces that have been programed include: 10 group homes (approximately 10 persons per home), a job placement / study center which includes: study spaces, lounge, day care, computer center, shop area, kitchen, job librarian office space, director's office space, certified public account office space, counselor office space, job library space, storage, and a health care facility space. The program can be broken down into three general type of spaces: private, semiprivate, and public. The private spaces will provide housing for the homeless during their period of training. These space will accommodate single residents, families and the handicapped. The semiprivate spaces are designated for the users of the private space with an emphasis placed on the notion of community and support for the radical process that they are undertaking. The job placement space will be the central <b>focus</b> <b>space</b> as far as the general public is concerned. The intention is to design a space that will become a center for job placement by using computers to link with companies across Indiana. This space is viewed as a preventative measure for homelessness as well as a necessity to getting out of homelessness. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|E
