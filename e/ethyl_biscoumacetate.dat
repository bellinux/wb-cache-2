40|$|The {{lanthanide}} complexes of <b>ethyl</b> <b>biscoumacetate</b> (ML 2 Cl. 2 H 2 O) {{have been}} synthesized and characterized by IR, H- 1 NMR, electronic spectra, thermoanalysis and molar conductance. The metal ions substituted a hydrogen atom of an hydroxy group and arc also bonded to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl {{group of the}} benzopyranyl ring. Electronic spectra showed that the lanthanide-ligand bond had some covalent character and the involvement of 4 f orbitals was very small. The light lanthanide complexes showed good anticoagulant action, expecially the lanthanum coordination compound, which was less toxic than the ligand...|$|E
40|$|Previously {{reported}} {{studies have}} outlined {{some of the}} factors which contribute to the difficulties in control of coumarin anticoagulant therapy. Bishydroxy-coumarin (Dicumarol) is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract slowly and erratically; biotransformation of the drug is slow and daily doses may be un-predictably cumulative; the rates of biotransformation of the drug by different subjects is widely divergent, and there are wide variations in the prothrombin response of different subjects to the same plasma level of drug (Weiner, 1950). <b>Ethyl</b> <b>biscoumacetate</b> (Tromexan) is absorbed rapidly and completely and its biotransformation is much more rapid than Dicumarol, resulting in a more rapid development of prothrombin response and a more rapid return of prothrombin activity to normal when administration is discontinued as compared to Dicuma-rol. However, in some instances {{it is difficult to}} maintain a desired prothrombin response because of relatively sudden changes in prothrombin time (Brodie, 1952; Weiner, 1953). Phenylindanedione, which has the following structural formula is not a coumarin compound, but influences prothrombin activity {{in a manner similar to}} the coumarins. It is reported to act rapidly like Tromexan, but with less fluctuation in prothrombin time (Blaustein, 1953). The present study describes the physiologic disposition of phenylindanedione in man and correlates these findings with the prothrombin response...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} with a new prothrombopenic agent, Dipaxin, is presented. With a 30 mg. dose a prothrombin complex concentration under 30 per cent is reached in 41 hours or less. When associ-ated with 1500 mg. of Tromexan the latent period is reduced to 24 hours. The prothrombopenic action of Dipaxin is readily counteracted with vitamin K, administered either orally or intra-venously. NTICOAGULANT therapy has its main indication during the acute phase of thromboembolic disease. Among the drugs with anticoagulant properties {{the most commonly used}} are those which interfere with the synthesis of prothrombin and stable fac-tor, the so-called prothrombopenic agents. We have had a large personal {{experience with}} bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol), <b>ethyl</b> <b>biscoumacetate</b> (Tromexan), cyclocumarol (Cumopyran) and phenindione (Danilone). From these, we consider Danilone the drug of choice as its action starts in a relatively short time (36 to 48 hours) and the initial and maintenance doses are very similar in dif-ferent individuals. ' Many efforts have been directed towards the finding of a prothrombopenic agent with a quicker action and a more reproducible dosage. We have studied a new indandione derivative the 2 -diphenylacetyl-l, 3 -indandione (Dipaxin) which appears to meet the above mentioned characteristics and are presenting in this paper our observations.
