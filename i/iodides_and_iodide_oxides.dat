40|$|AbstractThe {{inhibitory}} effect of supraphysiological iodide concentrations on thyroid hormone synthesis (Wolff–Chaikoff effect) and on thyrocyte proliferation is largely known as iodine autoregulation. However, the molecular {{mechanisms by which}} iodide modulates thyroid function remain unclear. In this paper, we analyze the transcriptome profile of the rat follicular cell lineage PCCl 3 under untreated and treated conditions with 10 − 3  M sodium iodide (NaI). Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) revealed 84 transcripts differentially expressed in response to iodide (p≤ 0. 001). We also showed that iodide excess inhibits the expression of essential genes for thyroid differentiation: Tshr, Nis, Tg, and Tpo. Relative expression of 14 of 20 transcripts selected by SAGE was confirmed by real-time PCR.

50|$|Most iodide salts are soluble in water, {{but often}} less {{so than the}} related {{chlorides}} <b>and</b> bromides. <b>Iodide,</b> being large, is less hydrophilic compared to the smaller anions. One consequence {{of this is that}} sodium iodide is highly soluble in acetone, whereas sodium chloride is not. The low solubility of silver <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> lead <b>iodide</b> reflects the covalent character of these metal iodides. A test for the presence of iodide ions is the formation of yellow precipitates of these compounds upon treatment of a solution of silver nitrate or lead(II) nitrate.|$|R
40|$|Anticholinesterase {{insecticides}} {{constitute a}} major portion of modern synthetic pesticides and the assessment of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition is widely used as a specific biomarker for evaluating the exposure of non-target organisms to these pollutants. However, most studies on this biomarker were developed on vertebrates and among invertebrates, gastropod mollusks are rarely used. However, gastropods are important members of aquatic habitats and therefore present a high ecological relevance for freshwater ecosystems. In this context, ChE activities were characterized in two freshwater gastropod mollusks, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Valvata piscinalis, in order to ascertain their value as sentinel species. Firstly, characterization of ChE activities was performed using different substrates (acetylcholine <b>iodide,</b> butyrylcholine <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> propionylcholine <b>iodide)</b> <b>and</b> specific inhibitors (eserine, iso-OMPA and BW 284 c 51).

Previous reports have covered the basic electrical and physical characteristics of these and several other materials. As we previously reported on 5 cm x 5 cm and 10 cm x 10 cm size imagers, direct digital radiography X-ray detectors, based on photoconductive polycrystalline mercuric iodide deposited on a flat panel thin film transistor (TFT) array, have a great potential for radiographic and fluoroscopic applications in medical imaging {{as well as in}} NDT, and security applications.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{biomarkers}} {{have been widely}} used for the assessment of effects and/or exposure to environmental contaminants. One of the most frequently used biomarkers is the inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE), which is a useful indicator of organophosphate and carbamate exposure and/or effects. Recent studies indicated that more than one ChE may be present in tissues of fish and that different forms may vary in their sensitivity to anticholinesterase agents. Cholinesterase activity of the juvenile of the common goby (Pomatoschistus microps), a widespread fish in estuaries of the Atlantic coast of northwestern Europe, was characterized using four substrates (acetylthiocholine iodide, acetyl-beta-metylthiocholine <b>iodide,</b> propionylthiocholine <b>iodide,</b> <b>and</b> S-butyrylthiocholine <b>iodide)</b> <b>and</b> three ChE inhibitors (eserine sulfate, BW 284 C 51, and iso-OMPA) in different tissues of the fish head. In addition, the range of ChE activity that may be considered as "normal" for non-exposed P. microps was determined. The results suggest the presence of two types of ChE in the whole-head homogenate. The present study underscores the relevance of ChE characterization before its use as a biomarker in biomonitoring studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
