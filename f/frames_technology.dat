In this regard an analytical model for recognition of effective criteria in selection suitable technology has been offered. Evaluation factors are a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria that are categorized in 4 main groups: technical, economic, environmental and socio cultural. Sub criteria concerning 4 groups and various kind of substituted technologies have been determined in construction industry through questionnaire and people comments on this matter. At first index capacity is determined by using Anthropy method then technologies are ranked through Topsis method. This method is called Anthropy combined method-Topsis in this article. Finally, continuous concrete <b>frames</b> <b>technology</b> [tunnel frame] has been introduced as the best technology in priority of substituted technologies in construction industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} scenario {{provides the}} most illustrative of entry points into this collection of evidence embodying the difference between play and tolerance. In a material assemblage, the looseness in a joint (expansion, pin, etc.) allows the assemblage to respond to dynamic loads such as wind and heat. Without this play, the construction becomes brittle, unable to flex under the concrete conditions of its situation. The looseness in this sense is productive. Tolerance, in the manufacturing of components, begins with a diagram (engineering specifications) and the looseness in its production, {{the difference between the}} diagram and actual, is derogatory. This thesis uses play and tolerance as points of departure and return, organizing a collection of evidence that <b>frames</b> <b>technology,</b> aesthetics, social organizations, systems of control and analysis as a way to illustrate and dramatize the effects of these different attitudes towards looseness, attempting to find places for play in the city in hopes of identifying potential for an urbanity outside the paradigm of compliance. by Jeremy Voorhees.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which two institutional logics around climate change - the climate change "convinced" and climate change "skeptical" logics - are truly competing or talking past each other in a way that can be described as a logic schism. Drawing on the concept of framing from social movement theory, it uses qualitative field observations from the largest climate deniers conference in the U. S. and a dataset of almost 800 op/eds from major news outlets over a two-year period to examine how convinced and skeptical arguments of opposing logics employ frames and issue categories to make arguments about climate change. This paper finds that the two logics are engaging in different debates on similar issues with the former focusing on solutions while the latter debates the definition of the problem. It concludes that the debate appears to be reaching a level of polarization where one might begin to question whether meaningful dialogue and problem solving has become unavailable to participants. The implications of such a logic schism is a shift from an integrative debate focused on addressing interests to a distributive battle over concessionary agreements with each side pursuing its goals by demonizing the other. Avoiding such an outcome requires the activation of, as yet, dormant "broker" <b>frames</b> (<b>technology,</b> religion and national security), the redefinition of existing ones (science, economics, risk, ideology) and the engagement of effective "climate brokers" to deliver them. ...|$|E

40|$|Components {{are rarely}} reused "as are". Most often, we must adapt components' functions, {{interfaces}} and other properties {{to make them}} fit into a specific reuse context. Therefore, reusable components must be flexible. This paper is {{a case study in}} applying <b>frame</b> <b>technology</b> to inject flexibility into components. During reuse, we can engineer anticipated variant requirements into components by customizing framed components at breakpoints marked with the frame language commands. Framed components can be also extended with new, unexpected requirements that arise during system evolution. <b>Frame</b> <b>technology</b> has achieved excellent productivity improvements in engineering data processing COBOL systems for reuse.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} study {{has shown that}} <b>frame</b> <b>technology</b> [1] supported by Fusion toolset can lead to reduction in time-to-market (70 %) and project costs (84 %). <b>Frame</b> <b>technology</b> has been developed to handle large COBOL-based business software product families. We wished to investigate how the principle of frame approach {{can be applied to}} support product families in other application domains, in particular to build distributed component-based systems written in Object-Oriented languages. As Fusion is tightly coupled with COBOL, we implemented our own tools based on frame concepts using the XML technology. In our solution, a generic architecture for a product family is a hierarchy of XML documents. Each such document contains a reusable program fragment instrumented for change with XML tags. We use a tool built on top of XML parsing framework JAXP to process documents in order to produce a custom member of a product family. Our solution is cost-effective and extensible. In the paper, we describe our solution, illustrating its use with examples. We intend to make our solution available to public in order to encourage investigation of frame concepts in other application domains, implementation languages and platforms...|$|R
