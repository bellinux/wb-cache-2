500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E

As a football fan, I think the MyFootballClub idea is fantastic.

2500|$|In January 2009, {{when asked}} whether Bunning was the best {{candidate}} to run or whether there were better GOP candidates for Bunning's Senate seat, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn said: [...] "I don't know. I think it's really up to Senator Bunning." [...] Bunning replied: [...] "Anybody can run for anything they choose. I am gearing up, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> challenge of taking on whoever {{comes out of the}} Democrat primary in May of 2010." [...] Kentucky State Senate President David L. Williams was reportedly considering running against Bunning in the primary. Bunning responded by threatening to sue the National Republican Senatorial Committee if they recruited a candidate to run against him in the primary.

Dr. Paul is the only candidate I know of who would have signed the Constitution of the United States had he been there. I'm with him, because {{he seems to be}} the only candidate who actually believes it has as much relevance today as it did a couple of hundred years ago. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> day when we can work out the differences we have with the same revolutionary vision and enthusiasm that is our American legacy."

Her hotels are first-rate; her prices are not excessive; her winter climate is delightful, and she is the centre of most charming excursions. The capital has thrown off much of her old lethargy. Her Geographical Society is doing hard and honest work; she has nobly expiated the national crime by becoming a 'Camonian' city; and she indulges freely in exhibitions. One, of Ornamental Art, {{was about to be}} opened when I last saw her, and it extended deep into the next spring.|$|E

Because women can do nothing except love, they've given it a ridiculous importance. They want to persuade us that it's the whole of life. It's an insignificant part. I know lust. That's normal and healthy. Love is a disease. Women are the instruments of my pleasure; I have no patience with their claim to be helpmates, partners, companions." ...|$|E

It is useless to be always looking back to be a laudator temporis acti se puero is placed by the wise and genial Horace to the discredit and not to the credit of old age. But I do think that each age has its own virtues, and its own type of excellence, and these do not return. We may have good things, but we shall not have the same good things. We shall have, I hope, good men, and great men, and noble men, in time to come, but I do not think we shall see again a Sir William Heathcote. That most charming mixture of dignified self respect, with unfailing gracious courtesy to others, those manners in which frankness and refinement mingled with and set off each other, that perfect purity of thought and utterance, and yet that thorough enjoyment of all that was good and racy in wit or humour--this has passed away with him. So beautiful and consistent a life in that kind of living we shall hardly see again.|$|E
