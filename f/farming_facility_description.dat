40|$|ABSTRACT: Marine {{farming is}} a major means by which humans can use the marine {{environment}} to acquire food resources. It has direct impact on fishing people's livelihoods, making it essential {{to establish a system}} designed to stabilize the demand and supply of farming resources and to continuously monitor the <b>farming</b> <b>facilities.</b> The existing method of detecting marine <b>farming</b> <b>facilities</b> uses aerial photos, compartmentalize the images, and detects the quantity and location of <b>farming</b> <b>facilities.</b> Such methods not only have limitations of the high cost for aerial photography and inability of immediate information acquisition, but also require more manpower to compartmentalize the imagery. Therefore, to improve the detection of the facilities, this study sought to use high-resolution imagery of South Korea's KOMPSAT- 3 satellite in applying the image processing algorithms for detecting the fish <b>farming</b> <b>facilities.</b> Detection of <b>farming</b> <b>facilities</b> first involves the application of HPF (high-pass filter) aimed at highlighting the facilities within images. HPF is the technique to create the existing pixel-based image information into frequencies, divide them into high-frequency bandwidth and low-frequency bandwidth, and highlight the high-frequency bandwidth. Generally, the high-frequency bandwidth refers to the area where the DN value difference between pixels is big. The images containing the highlighted <b>farming</b> <b>facilities,</b> which are extracted by applying HPF, are applied with the edge detection technique to extract the facility edges. For edge detection, the Canny Edge technique, which is relatively convenient and easy to use and has a high detection rate, was used. Cann...|$|R
