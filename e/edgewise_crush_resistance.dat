Thin {{honeycomb}} paperboard(THPB) is {{an emerging}} carton material instead of corrugated paperboard(CPB) recently, public research results and comparative data {{have not yet}} found at present. CPB of flute A is selected as contrast material in the paper since its thickness and density are similar to THPB, then properties of two kinds of paperboard are researched and compared according to test methods of edgewise compressive strength for sandwich structure, flatwise <b>crush</b> strength and <b>edgewise</b> <b>crush</b> strength for corrugated paperboard. The {{results showed that the}} compressive capacity of THPB in <b>edgewise</b> compressive, flatwise <b>crush</b> and <b>edgewise</b> <b>crush</b> performance is higher than that of CPB of flute A.

In a putatively coevolved interaction between a freshwater snail (Mexipyrgus churinceanus) and a molluscivorous cichlid (Herichthys minckleyi), we examined three components of this interaction: 1) spatial variation in two putative defensive traits, <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and shell pigmentation; 2) whether abiotic variables or frequency of molariform cichlids are associated with spatial patterns of <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and shell pigmentation and 3) whether variation in primary productivity accounted for small-scale variation in these defensive traits. Results: Using spatial autocorrelation to account for genetic and geographic divergence among populations, we found no autocorrelation among populations at small geographic and genetic distances for the two defensive traits. There was also no correlation between abiotic variables (temperature and conductivity) and snail defensive traits.

Conclusion <b>Crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and pigmentation of M. churinceanus exhibit striking variation at small spatial scales often associated with differences in primary productivity, substrate coloration {{and the frequency of}} molariform cichlids.

40|$|The {{geographic}} mosaic {{theory of}} coevolution predicts 1) spatial variation in predatory structures {{as well as}} prey defensive traits, and 2) trait matching in some areas and trait mismatching in others mediated by gene flow. We examined gene flow and documented spatial variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> in the freshwater snails Mexipyrgus churinceanus, Mexithauma quadripaludium, Nymphophilus minckleyi, {{and its relationship to}} the relative frequency of the crushing morphotype in the trophically polymorphic fish Herichthys minckleyi. <b>Crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and the frequency of the crushing morphotype did show spatial variation among 11 naturally replicated communities in the Cuatro Ciénegas valley in Mexico where these species are all endemic. The variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> among populations was not explained by geographic proximity or by genetic similarity in any species. We detected clear phylogeographic patterns and limited gene flow for the snails but not for the fish. Gene flow among snail populations in Cuatro Ciénegas could explain the mosaic of local divergence in shell strength and be preventing the fixation of the crushing morphotype in Herichthys minckleyi. Finally, consistent with trait matching across the mosaic, the frequency of the fish morphotype was negatively correlated with shell <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> likely reflecting the relative disadvantage of the crushing morphotype in communities where the snails exhibit relativel...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} 1) to develop standard testing practices to be used when evaluating <b>crush</b> <b>resistance</b> properties of abuse deterrent formulations, and 2) to determine which methods of particle size reduction (manual or electrical) are the most discriminatory for measuring <b>crush</b> <b>resistance</b> of tablet dosage forms. Background. Crushing, or particle size reduction, is often the first step to make a medication easier to snort, to dissolve for injection, or to destroy slowrelease mechanisms in order to achieve greater euphoric effects. However, no standard methods exist on testing crush resistant properties of prescription medications susceptible to abuse. Such testing is crucial for comparative purposes and to obtain abuse-deterrent labelling for the newly-marketed abuse-deterrent products. Methods. Tablets containing poly(ethylene oxide) as a deterrent agent and acetaminophen as model drug were formulated on tablet press (2000 pounds) before undergoing a post compaction thermal process reported for a crush-resistant marketed formulation. <b>Crush</b> <b>resistance</b> was then assessed using manual (i. e., pill crusher, pestle-mortar) and mechanical (i. e., hardness tester, ball mill, high shear grinder, domestic blender) methods at different time durations and sample mass. The resultant product was then analyzed by sieve analysis. Results. Significant differences were observed between the particle size distributions using different methods. The domestic blender and high shear grinder had better ability to differentiate products compared to other tooling. Conclusion. There is no universal method to measure <b>crush</b> <b>resistance,</b> and methods used to perform particle size reduction can display different level of resistance to manipulation Grants.

40|$|Most of {{the shell}} {{material}} in snails is composed of calcium carbonate but the organic shell matrix determines the properties of calcium carbonate crystals. It {{has been shown that}} the deposition of calcium carbonate is affected by the ingestion of organic compounds. We hypothesize that organic compounds not synthesized by the snails are important for shell strength and must be obtained from the diet. We tested this idea indirectly by evaluating whether the abundance of the organic matter that snails eat is related to the strength of their shells. We measured shell <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> in the snail Mexipyrgus churinceanus and the abundance of the most common aquatic macrophyte, the water lily Nymphaea ampla, in ten bodies of water in the valley of Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico. We used stable isotopes to test the assumption that these snails feed on water lily organic matter. We also measured other factors that can affect <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance,</b> such as the density of crushing predators, snail density, water pH, and the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the water. The isotope analysis suggested that snails assimilate water lily organic matter that is metabolized by sediment bacteria. The variable that best explained the variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> found among sites was the local abundance of water lilies. We propose that the local amount of water lily organic matter provides organic compounds important in shell biomineralization, thus determining <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Hence, we propose that a third trophic level could be important in the coevolution of snai...|$|R
