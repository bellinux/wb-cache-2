Such deposit structures can create environment for underdeposit corrosion of the substrate material, e.g., intergranular attack, pitting, stress corrosion cracking, or localized wastage. Porosity and permeability of the deposits will likely influence the probability of underdeposit corrosion.

40|$|A typical blade {{material}} {{is made of}} Nickel super alloy and can bear temperatures up to 950 °C.

Though the turbine has an internal cooling system, the cooling is not adequate to reduce {{the temperature of the}} blade substrate. Therefore to protect the blade material as well as increase the efficiency of the turbine, thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) must be used. A TBC coating of 250 μm thick can reduce the temperature by up to 200 ° C. Air Plasma Spray Process (APS) and High Enthalpy Plasma Spray Process (100 HE) were the processes used for coating the blades with the TBCs. Because thermal conductivity increases with increase in temperature, it is desired that these processes yield very low thermal conductivities at high temperatures in order not to damage the blade. An experiment was carried out using Flash line 5000 apparatus to compare the thermal conductivity of both processes. The apparatus could also be used to determine the thermal diffusivity and specific heat of the TBCs. 75 to 2800 K was the temperature range used in the experimentation.

50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) are used {{extensively on the}} surface of superalloy in both commercial and military gas turbine engines to increase component life and engine performance. A coating of about 1-200 µm can reduce the temperature at the superalloy surface by up to 200K. TBCs are really a system of coatings consisting of a bond coat, a thermally grown oxide (TGO), and a thermally insulating ceramic top coat. In most applications, the bond coat is either a MCrAlY (where M=Ni or NiCo) or a Pt modified aluminide coating. A dense bond coat is required to provide protection of the superalloy substrate from oxidation and <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> attack and to form an adherent, slow growing TGO on its surface. The TGO is formed by oxidation of the aluminum that is contained in the bond coat. The current (first generation) thermal insulation layer is composed of 7wt % yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) with a typical thickness of 100-300 µm. Yttria stabilized zirconia is used due to its low thermal conductivity (2.6W/mK for fully dense material), relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, and good high temperature stability. The electron beam directed vapor deposition (EB-DVD) process used to apply the TBC to turbine airfoils produces a columnar microstructure with several levels of porosity. The porosity between the columns is critical to providing strain tolerance (via a very low in-plane modulus), as it would otherwise spall on thermal cycling due to thermal expansion mismatch with the superalloy substrate. The porosity within the columns reduces the thermal conductivity of the coating.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== Water has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too <b>hot.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated.|$|E

5000|$|While Ni based {{superalloys}} {{are excellent}} high temperature materials and have proven very useful, Co based superalloys potentially possess superior <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion,</b> oxidation, and wear resistance {{as compared to}} Ni-based superalloys. For this reason, efforts have also been put into developing Co based superalloys {{over the past several}} years. Despite that, traditional Co based superalloys have not found widespread usage because they have a lower strength at high temperature than Ni based superalloys. The main {{reason for this is that}} they appear to lack the γ’ precipitation strengthening that is so important in the high temperature strength of Ni-based superalloys. A 2006 report on metastable γ’-Co3(Al,W) intermetallic compound with the L12 structure suggests Co based alloys as alternative to traditional Ni based superalloys. However this class of alloys was reported in a PhD thesis by C. S. Lee in 1971. The two-phase microstructure consists of cuboidal γ’ precipitates embedded in a continuous γ matrix and is therefore morphologically identical to the microstructure observed in Ni based superalloys. Like in the Ni-based system, there is a high degree of coherency between the two phases which is one of the main factors resulting in the superior strength at high temperatures. This provides a pathway for the development of a new class of load-bearing Co based superalloys for application in severe environments. In these alloys 'W' is the crucial addition for getting γ’ intermetallic compound that makes them much denser (>9.6 gm/cm3) compared to Ni-based superalloys. Recently a new class of γ - γ’ cobalt based superalloys have been developed that are [...] "W" [...] free and have much lower density comparable to nickel based superalloys. In addition to the fact that many of the properties of these new Co based superalloys could be better than those of the more traditional Ni based ones, Co also has a higher melting temperature than Ni. Therefore, if the high temperature strength could be improved, the development of novel Co based superalloys could allow for an increase in jet engine operation temperature resulting in an increased efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of materials at high temperatures {{is determined by}} their resistance to mechanical deformation and attack by the environment. High temperature corrosion may involve attack in the gas phase or the combined effects of hot gases and solid/molten deposits. <b>Hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{can be thought of}} as deposit modified, gas induced degradation of materials and therefore requires that a molten salt deposit is present on the materials surface. Due to an appraisal of the operating conditions within utility turbines which form part of a combined cycle coal fired power plant the deposition of alkali sulphates onto hot parts is an inherent product of the process.

These two types of <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> processes are termed as High Temperature <b>Hot</b> <b>Corrosion</b> (HTHC) or Type I and Low Temperature <b>Hot</b> <b>Corrosion</b> (LTHC) or Type II, respectively. Both these types of <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> are encountered in many industrial applications such as boiler and gas turbine components in coal based power plants, aircraft industries and certain chemical plants. etc. The role of the liquid salt is to dissolve the protective oxide scale by the acid or basic fluxing mechanism of the salt.

40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} {{is on the}} High Velocity Oxy-Fuel coating of Ti- 31 alloy using fused, blended powder, Al 2 O 3 +CoCrAlTaY. <b>Hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> experiments were done on the coated and uncoated Ti- 31 under a salt environment of 50 % Na 2 SO 4 and 50 %V 2 O 5 at 800 °C. Thermogravimetric cycles of 1 hour heating and 20 minute cooling was followed for <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> study. After each cycle weight measurement was carried out. After <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion,</b> the samples were characterized using XRD and SEM/EDS. It was observed that the coated sample is more resistant to <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> than uncoated sample. XRD and SEM analysis indicated that the surface is rich in oxides. Gravimetric analysis indicated that the sample weight gain was following a parabolic relationship with time. A damage mechanism is discussed for the <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> damage of the samples. Presence of high level of chromium in HVOF sprayed coating imparts improved <b>hot</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance at 800 °C, in a molten salt environment of Na 2 SO 4 + V 2 O 5...|$|E
40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} (MMCs) are engineering {{materials in}} which a hard ceramic component is dispersed in a ductile metal matrix {{in order to obtain}} characteristics such as hardness and corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance is one of the important properties of nanocomposites; however, the corrosion mechanism of the Al- SiC nanocomposite has not yet been determined [...] In this study, bulk Al- 5 % SiC nanocomposite was prepared using mechanical alloying and the <b>hot</b> press method. <b>Corrosion</b> behavior was then investigated using EIS techniques such as Nyquist and the Bod diagram. A larger charge transfer resistance was found for the Al- SiC nanocomposite by the EIS diagrams, confirming its corrosion resistance in a 3. 5 wt % NaCl solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a gas}} turbine can be improved by increasing operating temperature. Construction materials should both meet high strength requirements and exhibit <b>hot</b> alkali <b>corrosion</b> resistance. Structural ceramics based on silicon nitride are promising candidates for high temperature engineering applications because of their high strength and good resistance to corrosion. Their performance varies significantly with the mechanical properties of boundary phases which, in turn, depend on their chemical composition, thickness of the amorphous phase, and the deformation process. To make silicon nitride ceramics tough, SiAlON ceramics were developed with controlled crystallization of the amorphous grain boundary phase. Crystallization of the grain boundary glass improves the high temperature mechanical properties of silicon nitride ceramics. Thus, the knowledge of silicon oxynitride ceramics corrosion behavior in Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } becomes important for engineers in designing appropriate part for turbines working at high temperatures. So far {{there has been no}} report concerning alkali attack on SiAlON ceramics in the presence of SO{sub 2 } and chlorine in flue gas. The goal of this project was to investigate alkali corrosion of SiAlON-Y structural ceramics under combustion conditions in the presence of sodium derived components...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hot</b> salt stress <b>corrosion</b> {{cracking}} (HSSCC) behaviour of alloy IMI 834 was {{studied to}} {{examine the effect of}} long-term exposure and the role of hydrogen. Studies were conducted by exposing the salt-coated specimens at 300, 350 and 400 degrees C, at different stress levels for 1000 h, and in the unstressed condition; and the role of hydrogen in HSSCC was studied by using X-ray diffraction. Although the specimens passed 1000 h of hot salt exposure test at stress levels higher than their yield strength, at these temperatures, the post-exposure tensile tests showed a significant loss in ductility and the presence of micro cracks. The study shows the presence of hydrides, which are responsible for HSSCC (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
