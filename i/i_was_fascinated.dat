500|$|Love in the Time of Cholera {{is based}} on the stories of two couples. The young love of Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza {{is based on}} the love affair of García Márquez's parents. However, as García Márquez {{explains}} in an interview: “The only difference is [...] married. And {{as soon as they were}} married, they were no longer interesting as literary figures." [...] The love of old people is based on a newspaper story about the death of two Americans, who were almost 80 years old, who met every year in Acapulco. They were out in a boat one day and were murdered by the boatman with his oars. García Márquez notes, [...] "Through their death, the story of their secret romance became known. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> by them. They were each married to other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Director John Woo has {{described}} The Killer as being about [...] "honour and friendship", [...] "trying {{to find out}} if there is something common between two people" [...] and as a [...] "romantic poem". The structure of the film follows two men {{on opposite sides of the}} law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine. Woo recalled [...] "When I was young <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, but deep in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that." [...] Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo's film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating [...] "People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege. It's certainly not intentional." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there was a time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E

500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> by the mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't {{the scientific study of}} these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E

As a result, rhythm, in particular, has become very important. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fascinated</b> by {{relentless}} drive and energy.”. Salient features of Fagerlund’s music are his interest in large-scale forms and details of them, and a profound view of music as the expresser of fundamental questions and existential experiences.|$|R

2500|$|Although Brach {{began writing}} the {{screenplay}} in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a film adaptation of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos {{in order to}} research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the American Humane Association, Annaud stated: [...] "Each time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fascinated</b> with the tigers, {{to a point that}} I thought to do a movie called The Tiger instead of The Bear. In those days I felt that the bear, because they're so often vertical, would give me a better identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers."

It {{was very much}} like creating a movie soundtrack—just being {{in a room with}} a couple of random objects and using them to create the sound another object would make. Like spinning quarters on a table to get the sound a clock would make if it was being wound, or rolling an old toy car across a picnic table to simulate the sound of an old windmill. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fascinated</b> with that kind of thing.|$|R

50|$|The idea of {{an island}} appeals to me as {{representation}} {{of many of the}} values that we strive for in our 21st-century culture: individualism, independence, autonomy, and self-sufficiency. Yet at the same time, these are the same desires that isolate us and lessen collective social and political power. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fascinated</b> at how the things that set us free are also the same things that oppress us; you could say that the concept of the deserted island is both our greatest fantasy and our greatest fear.|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to disagree on nearly everything {{when it comes to}} human agency. Nonetheless, certain things are written in stone. One thinks. One acts. One makes mistakes. My focus in this dissertation is on these three simple facts and the relation between them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fascinated</b> by the different roles that knowledge plays with each: that is, the kind of knowledge one has of thoughts, actions, and mistakes. What can one know about the thoughts, actions, and mistakes of others, and how? How does one come to have knowledge about one’s own...|$|R

Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines were at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, that far had they been what I should call feminine.|$|E

In spite of her frankly expressed preference for me she had an elusiveness that made a continual appeal to my imagination.

She was a tomboy, yet her own sex was enhanced rather than overwhelmed by contact with the other: {{and no matter how}} many trees she climbed she never seemed to lose her daintiness.

And second, is fable posterior to the (political) event, trying to make sense of it, preserve it, provide a basis for fidelity to the event, or does fable also have a virtual power in producing the event itself...|$|R
