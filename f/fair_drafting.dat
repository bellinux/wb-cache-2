He began work on a clean narrative {{in the first half of}} 1919 while in Paris for the Peace Conference and, later that summer, while back in Egypt. By December 1919, he had a <b>fair</b> <b>draft</b> of most of the ten books that make up the Seven Pillars of Wisdom but lost it (except for the introduction and final two books) when he misplaced his briefcase while changing trains at Reading railway station. National newspapers alerted the public to the loss of the [...] "hero's manuscript", but to no avail; the draft remained lost. Lawrence refers to this version as [...] "Text I" [...] and says that had it been published, it would have been some 250,000 words in length.|$|R

5000|$|J. R. R. Tolkien wrote a {{great deal}} of {{material}} connected to the Middle-earth legendarium that was not published in his lifetime. Although he had originally intended to publish The Silmarillion along with The Lord of the Rings, and parts of it were in a finished state, he died in 1973 with the project incomplete. After his father's death, Christopher Tolkien, whom his father had once called his [...] "chief critic and collaborator", embarked on organizing the masses of his father's unpublished writings, some of them written on odd scraps of paper a half-century earlier. Much of the material was handwritten; frequently a <b>fair</b> <b>draft</b> was written over a half-erased first draft, and names of characters routinely changed between {{the beginning and end of}} the same draft. In the years following, Christopher Tolkien worked on the manuscripts and was able to produce an edition of The Silmarillion for publication in 1977; his assistant for part of this work was the young Guy Gavriel Kay, who would later become a noted fantasy author.|$|R

6000|$|... [Composed at Este after Shelley's {{first visit}} to Venice, 1818 (Autumn); first {{published}} in the [...] "Posthumous Poems", London, 1824 (edition Mrs. Shelley). Shelley's original intention had been to print the poem in Leigh Hunt's [...] "Examiner"; but {{he changed his mind}} and, on August 15, 1819, sent the manuscript to Hunt to be published anonymously by Ollier. This manuscript, found by Mr. Townshend Mayer, and by him placed in the hands of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., is described at length in Mr. Forman's Library Edition of the poems (volume 3 page 107). The date, 'May, 1819,' affixed to [...] "Julian and Maddalo" [...] in the [...] "Posthumous Poems", 1824, indicates the time when the text was finally revised by Shelley. Sources of the text are (1) [...] "Posthumous Poems", 1824; (2) the Hunt manuscript; (3) a <b>fair</b> <b>draft</b> of the poem amongst the Boscombe manuscripts; (4) [...] "Poetical Works", 1839, 1st and 2nd editions (Mrs. Shelley).

40|$|The Independent Electoral Commission Bill {{was drafted}} six times {{before it was}} finally accepted. The aim of the Bill was {{to provide for the}} {{establishment}} of the Independent Electoral Commission. The Commission would be responsible for ensuring that elections were conducted in a free and <b>fair</b> manner. <b>Draft</b> one was tabled {{at a meeting of the}} Negotiating Council on 21 May 1993. The draft was compiled by three members of the Technical Committee – Mr R B Rosenthal, Prof. D. Davis and Adv. H. R. Laubscher. The second draft expanded on the functions and duties of the Independent Electoral Commission and noted that the Act would possibly have to be amended to accommodate the redrafting of the existing Electoral Act. The third draft of the Bill contains a large number of textual changes, accompanied by footnotes to explain the changes. The purpose of the fourth draft was to formulate the Bill into a document suitable for presentation to Parliament. The Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Independent Electoral Commision Bill contains draft 5 of the Bill, as well as an explanatory memorandum, which states that all differences which had arisen during debates had been resolved. Added phrases and clauses are highlighted in bold type. Draft six is the final draft...|$|R
2500|$|The National Transitional Council (...) was {{established}} on 27 February to consolidate efforts {{for change in}} the rule of Libya. The main objectives of the group was to co-ordinate resistance between towns held in rebel control, and represent {{the opposition to the}} world, but did not include forming an interim government. The Benghazi-based opposition government had called for a no-fly zone and airstrikes against the Jamahiriya. The council began to refer to itself as the Libyan Republic and by March had a website. Former Jamahiriya Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil said in February that the new government would prepare for elections and they could be held in three months. On 29 March, the political and international affairs committee of the Council presented its eight-point plan for Libya in The Guardian newspaper, stating they would hold free and <b>fair</b> elections and <b>draft</b> a national constitution.|$|R
40|$|Federal {{and state}} reporters {{are filled with}} {{examples}} of lopsided arbitration agreements drafted by employers with the apparent intent of discouraging employees from successfully bringing valid claims. The case reporters contain far fewer examples of employment dispute resolution programs that are carefully designed to ensure that employees receive a fundamentally fair forum for the resolution of their employment disputes, for the obvious reason that employees {{are less likely to}} challenge these programs. Similarly, most scholarly commentary focuses on the overall merits and demerits of employment arbitration, or on problems posed by particular provisions often found in employment arbitration agreements, but not on employment dispute resolution programs that are designed with an eye toward employee fairness. Both the case law and the legal commentary, therefore, provide an arguably distorted picture of extant employment dispute resolution programs - from these perspectives, all the apples look rotten. This article begins from the premise that much can be learned from closely examining a well-drafted and -implemented employment dispute resolution program. Such a program can (1) provide scrupulous employers with a model for <b>drafting</b> <b>fair,</b> ethical, and enforceable dispute resolution programs; (2) provide a benchmark to courts in their decisions of whether to enforce other employment dispute resolution programs; and (3) serve as a reminder that not all the arbitral apples are rotten. This article examines in detail the Dispute Resolution Program of Anheuser-Busch, and finds that it is possible for an employment dispute resolution program culminating in binding arbitration simultaneously to serve (1) the employer 2 ̆ 7 s goal of containing employment litigation costs, (2) the employee 2 ̆ 7 s goal of access to a fair forum for resolving employment disputes, and (3) both parties 2 ̆ 7 goal of promoting the non-adversarial resolution of employment disputes. The findings of this article are particularly important now that Congress appears increasingly likely to consider statutory amendments prohibiting predispute employment arbitration agreements. This article should not, however, be taken as a blanket endorsement of employment arbitration. We argue merely that employment arbitration can be fair to employees, not that employment arbitration is necessarily, or even usually, fair...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{examination}} {{of the history of}} the guarantee reveals that equity treated the guarantor as a favoured debtor, given the absence of real benefit to the guarantor. However, these protections have largely been removed by standard form guarantee contracts used by, credit providers, and the law is also otherwise deficient in protecting consumer guarantors. As the expansion of the use of credit in recent years has meant that guarantees are now sometimes given carelessly and thoughtlessly, by persons without adequate education and resources to protect their interests, regulation is required (Chapter 1). The statutory regulation of guarantees before the passing of the Credit Act was inadequate. After examining the scope and nature of the Credit Act, the effect of the Credit Act on the regulation of guarantees is examined (Chapter 2). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate pre-contractual information given to guarantors is then examined. It is concluded that room for improvement exists (Chapter 3). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate the exercise of undue influence, unfair pressure and the making of unconscionable bargains is then examined and it is concluded that developments will occur rapidly in this area (Chapter 4). Common law and statutory provisions which discharge the guarantor from liability are then examined in the light of the operation of the Credit Act and it is concluded that some flaws exist both in principle and in the operation of the law (Chapter 5). The extent to which the guarantor is entitled to control the appropriation of payments made by the debtor, and the extent to which the guarantor's liability is coextensive with that of the debtor is then examined and some changes suggested (Chapter 6). The guarantor's rights to have action taken first against the debtor and the debtor's assets, the guarantor's rights to notice before action, and the right of indemnification after action, are then examined (Chapter 7). The possible reasons for the non-regulation of guarantees are examined and dismissed; past suggestions for reform and possible future reforms are examined (Chapter 8). Standard form contracts of guarantee are discussed and the text of a <b>draft</b> <b>fair,</b> simple English, standard form guarantee is suggested (Chapter 9). The law is as stated at 30 November, 1985. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
