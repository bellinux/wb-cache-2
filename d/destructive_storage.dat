40|$|Background Insects use pheromones, {{chemical}} {{signals that}} underlie all animal behaviors, for communication and for attracting mates. Synthetic pheromones {{are widely used}} in pest control strategies because they are environmentally safe. The production of insect pheromones in transgenic plants, which could be more economical and effective in producing isomerically pure compounds, has recently been successfully demonstrated. This research requires information regarding the pheromone biosynthetic pathways and the characterization of pheromone biosynthetic enzymes (PBEs). We used Illumina sequencing to characterize the pheromone gland (PG) transcriptome of the Pyralid moth, Ephestia cautella, a <b>destructive</b> <b>storage</b> pest, to reveal putative candidate genes involved in pheromone biosynthesis, release, transport and degradation. Results We isolated the E. cautella pheromone compound as (Z,E) - 9, 12 -tetradecadienyl acetate, and the major pheromone precursors 16 :acyl, 14 :acyl, E 14 - 16 :acyl, E 12 - 14 :acyl and Z 9,E 12 - 14 :acyl. Based on the abundance of precursors, two possible pheromone biosynthetic pathways are proposed. Both pathways initiate from C 16 :acyl-CoA, with one involving ∆ 14 and ∆ 9 desaturation to generate Z 9,E 12 - 14 :acyl, and the other involving the chain shortening of C 16 :acyl-CoA to C 14 :acyl-CoA, followed by ∆ 12 and ∆ 9 desaturation to generate Z 9,E 12 - 14 :acyl-CoA. Then, a final reduction and acetylation generates Z 9,E 12 - 14 :OAc. Illumina sequencing yielded 83, 792 transcripts, and we obtained a PG transcriptome of 49. 5 Mb. A total of 191 PBE transcripts, which included pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptides, fatty acid transport proteins, acetyl-CoA carboxylases, fatty acid synthases, desaturases, β-oxidation enzymes, fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) and fatty acetyltransferases (FATs), were selected from the dataset. A comparison of the E. cautella transcriptome data with three other Lepidoptera PG datasets revealed that 45...|$|E

40|$|Results from {{an ongoing}} {{research}} {{project of the}} archaeological state museum chateau Gottorf in Schleswig and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Hamburg are presented. The manufacturing techniques of Neolithic bronze axes were investigated using non <b>destructive</b> measurements. <b>Storage</b> ring based techniques as X-ray diffraction in transmission and reflection geometry were used to investigate effects of cast and post cast treatment of bronze axes, while in parallel X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used to monitor the stoichiometric bronze distribution of the objects. Measuring the effects they have on bronze axes open questions {{of the use of}} stone tools were addressed [1, 2]. Comparing measurements of reproduced bronze axes with those of historic origin the replicated objects could be iteratively be improved, verifying the manufacturing process. The replicates were cast in a modern casting process with sand and clay molds in the fondry museum “Howaldtsche Metallgiesserei e. V. ” (Kiel, Germany) and with a quasi neolithic casting process at chateau Gottorf. The measurements were performed in Hamburg at the DESY storage rings DORIS and PETRA using Beamlines BW 5, G 3, L, P 02, P 07 and W 2. Besides the answers to the archaeological questions the experiments lead to the discovery of a faked 19 th century hoard find which unsuspiciously had been on display in the museum since 150 years [3].

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} compositional {{changes in the}} quality of 'Ortanique' tangor after coating with the carnauba-based waxes Aruá Tropical® or Star Light®. The storage conditions studied simulated those of local marketing (22 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5 % RH). Non-destructive analysis, mass loss, peel color, and sensory evaluation, were performed upon coating and every three days up to the fifteenth day of <b>storage.</b> <b>Destructive</b> analysis, peel moisture content, chlorophyll of the peel, pulp color, juice content, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and soluble solids to titratable acidity ratio, were performed upon coating and every four days up to the sixteenth day of storage. The assay was conducted using an entirely randomized design, with three replications (destructive analyses) or ten replications (non-destructive analyses), in a split plot scheme. Wax-coating, especially Aruá Tropical®, maintained fruit freshness by reducing mass loss and peel dehydration and retaining green color. Peel moisture content, chlorophyll content, and juice content had lower rates in the wax coated fruits. Puncture force, soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, and soluble solids to titratable acidity ratio varied vary little over the course of storage. Sensory evaluation showed that the application of Aruá Tropical keeps 'Ortanique' tangor fresher for 6 days longer for commercialization...|$|R
