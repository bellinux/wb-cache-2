40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some {{consequences of}} <b>forming</b> <b>by</b> shear, {{a situation that}} is sometimes claimed to occur in incremental forming. The determination of the principal strains and principal directions is discussed in detail. Two methods are presented: using a circular grid (although simulated on the computer), and by deriving formulae from the theory; both yield identical results. The strains assuming <b>forming</b> <b>by</b> shear are found to be (much) higher than in situations of <b>forming</b> <b>by</b> stretch. This affects notably more fundamental studies on material behaviour in incremental forming. The effects are illustrated using experimental data obtained with pre-stressed material...|$|R
