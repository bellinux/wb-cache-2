5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry <b>had</b> <b>emerged,</b> Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max <b>had</b> <b>emerged</b> from the battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, Amarillo <b>had</b> <b>emerged</b> {{as one of}} the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its {{population}} grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians <b>had</b> <b>emerged,</b> eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E

5|$|Eaton {{took his}} revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports <b>had</b> <b>emerged</b> {{accurately}} stating that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson {{about the possibility}} of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson {{at the time of the}} Seminole War. Eaton did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the Telegraph. This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.|$|E

5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at {{the head}} of an army in July 1832.

PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals <b>had</b> <b>emerged</b> victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E
