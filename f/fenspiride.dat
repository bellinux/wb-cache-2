40|$|The authors stud the {{clinical}} efficiency of <b>fenspiride</b> (Erespal) among children (n = 46), suffering from acute bronchitis. It was shown that <b>fenspiride</b> reduced the cough duration and conduced to faster {{improvement of the}} patients' health. Besides, <b>fenspiride</b> application was accompanied by {{the reduction of the}} anti-inflammatory cytokines both in the blood serum and condensate of expired air.

40|$|A {{problem of}} {{etiology}} and pathogenesis of acute respiratory infections in children are observed in this article. Modern approach to management of its treatment in pediatric patients, including often ailing children, is described. Authors give characteristics to main directions of treatment of obstructive syndrome. An experience of anti-inflammatory therapy with <b>fenspiride</b> (eurespal) in children of different age is summa ized in this article.

40|$|The trial {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} factors predisposing to exudative otitis media development in 709 children, needing regular audiologist’s check-up. It was shown that dominating risk factor of auditory tube’s function disorders is hypertrophy of palatine tonsil (it was detected in 69 % of children). Besides, doctors from children’s out-patient clinics often use conservative treatment in children with chronic exudative otitis media. Analysis of data obtained {{at the time of}} treatment of 180 hospitalized children under the age 1 – 17 years old with exudative otitis media showed that combination of tympanostomy with <b>fenspiride</b> (Erespal) allows achieving of more significant decrease (1. 3 times low) audibility threshold of different oscillations than in children from control (treated without <b>fenspiride).</b> Key words: children, exudative otitis media, timpanostomy, <b>fenspiride.</b> (Voprosy sovremennoi pediatrii —  Current Pediatrics. 2009; 8 (4) : 102 - 105) </span...|$|E

The results of treatment with anti inflammatory medication <b>fenspiride</b> (eurespal) are presented. Russian and foreign literature data and information from american guideline in cough treatment was used in this article. Key words: cough, children, <b>fenspiride.</b> </strong...|$|E
40|$|Optimization {{of methods}} to treat and {{rehabilitate}} children, suffering from lymphopharyngeal ring diseases, is an urgent medical and social issue. The {{purpose of the}} given research was to study the efficacy of <b>fenspiride</b> (erespal) in treatment of children with chronic lymphopharyngeal ring diseases. The authors generalized {{the findings of the}} 3 byear dynamic observation carried out among 157 children aged between 3 and 8 years old. They found out that the 2 B week fenspirideb based therapy in average age doses has positive effects on the run of the acute respiratory infection, coming to existence against the hypertrophy of the lymphopharyngeal ring tissues, accelerates the remission of chronic adenoiditis. In the event of the repeat application, <b>fenspiride</b> increases efficacy of the nonspecific resistance and local immunity factors, rebuilds the microflora, slows down the progress of hypertrophy of the lymphopharyngeal ring tissues. Thus, fenspiridebbased therapy is a perspective trend in treatment of children with chronic lymphopharyngeal ring diseases.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{epidemiological}} studies {{of recent years}} show that schoolchildren of middle and high classes {{can be considered as}} a potential audience for the prevention of the formation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a disease that significantly affect the quality of life and life expectancy. Among the toxic components of tobacco smoke the most significant are polycyclic polycarbonates, oxides of nitrogen, oxides and dioxides of carbon. This study examined the content of carbon monoxide in exhaled air at smoking schoolchildren using the smokelayzer and assessed the possibility of using <b>fenspiride</b> in a complex health care interventions for tobacco smoking. The results of this study indicate a pronounced positive role of <b>fenspiride</b> in a complex of therapeutic measures in smoking schoolchildren. </p...|$|E
40|$|The cytological {{investigation}} of exudates, obtained during tympanostomies, showed the predomination of inflammatory-regenerative cytograms types when using <b>Fenspiride</b> (Eurespal) in treatment of secretory stage of chronic exudative otitis media. Received data confirm, that treatment with this drug shortens {{the course of}} exudative otitis media and contributes to more rapid change from destructive to reparative stage of inflammation, which prevents the development of adhesive process in the middle ear. </em...|$|E
