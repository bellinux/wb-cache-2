5|$|Four {{of the men}} deserted {{when they}} reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for twomonths.

In 1951-52 he made five appearances, gaining selection only when Victoria’s Test players were busy representing Australia. The following season, he broke through for his maiden first-class century, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> previously passed 50.|$|E

5|$|Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Leatherface. He regarded Leatherface as being mentally retarded and <b>having</b> <b>never</b> learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke. John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to <b>having</b> <b>never</b> been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|Seven shorter NoL Eurostar trains {{for these}} Regional Eurostar {{services}} were built, but these services never ran. Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris {{at the time}} of growth of low-cost air travel during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against the cheaper and quicker airlines. Other reasons that have been suggested for these services <b>having</b> <b>never</b> been run were both government policies and the disruptive privatisation of British Rail.|$|E

5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized {{for the next}} several days. It organized more fully and intensified into a tropical storm on August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> threatened land.|$|E

Kagame attended the subsequent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, addressing the Business Forum. Rwanda also successfully applied for a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2012, taking over the presidency of that organisation in April 2013.|$|E

He scored four centuries in the tournament, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> scored one in the Twenty20 format {{before the start of the}} season, and also became the first player to reach the 4000-run milestone in the IPL. At the launch event of his biography, 'Driven: The Virat Kohli Story' in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli announced that RCB would be the IPL franchise that he would permanently play for.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with 16 goals and 30 points over 62 games. <b>Having</b> <b>never</b> qualified for the playoffs with the Panthers previously in his career, Booth made his post-season debut in 2012. Playing against the Los Angeles Kings, he recorded one assist over five games as the first-seeded Canucks were eliminated in the first round. Booth told reporters prior to the playoffs that he was struggling with his diminished role with the Canucks, in comparison to his time with the Panthers, alluding to his ice time. The previous year, he was averaging nearly 19 minutes per game, which dropped to 15 minutes as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor {{attended}} East Carteret High School, {{where his}} pitching ability {{caused him to}} be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder in a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> played a game above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to never reach the major leagues, the other one being Steve Chilcott.|$|E

5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>never</b> seen combat, Babcock did not {{consider}} himself a veteran {{and moved to the}} United States in the 1920s, where he joined the United States Army and eventually became an electrician. In May 2007, following the death of Dwight Wilson, he became the last surviving veteran of the First World War who served with the Canadian forces. From that point he received international attention, including 109th birthday greetings from Queen Elizabeth II, the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian Prime Minister, until his death on February 18, 2010.|$|E

English and Hindi being the official language of Sikkim and India respectively, are also widely spoken and understood in most of Sikkim, particularly in Gangtok. Other languages spoken in Gangtok include Bhutia (Sikkimese), Tibetan and Lepcha.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite <b>having</b> <b>never</b> mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E

McCarney is the all-time leader in games coached (141), years coached (11) and wins (56), while Bert German is the all-time leader in winning percentage (.833). W. P.

5|$|Irene cycled between {{apparent}} reintensification {{and significant}} weakening, becoming so disorganized {{in the early}} morning of August 10 that forecasters were considering declaring the storm dissipated. However, the depression continued to move westward into more favorable conditions and again attained tropical storm status, rapidly strengthening to a Category1 hurricane on August 14. Later, it strengthened even further in low shear conditions under an upper level anticyclone. On August 16 it briefly strengthened to a Category2 hurricane, but began to weaken in cooler waters shortly thereafter. It became extratropical southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland on August 18, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> posed a threat to land.|$|E
