25|$|As Premier, Li was {{the most}} visible {{representative}} of China's government who backed {{the use of force}} to quell the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. During the protests Li used his authority as premier to declare martial law; and, in cooperation with Deng Xiaoping, who was the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, he ordered the June 1989 military crackdown against student pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. Li advocated a largely conservative approach to Chinese economic reform, which placed him at odds with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who fell out of favour in 1989. After Zhao was removed from office Li promoted a conservative socialist <b>economic</b> <b>agenda,</b> but lost influence to incoming vice-premier Zhu Rongji and was unable to prevent the increasing free-market liberalization of the Chinese economy. During his time in office he was {{at the helm of the}} controversial Three Gorges Dam project.

The Calgary Herald took up this call, {{going so far as to}} offer Aberhart a full page to lay out his approach in detail. Aberhart refused, on the grounds that he considered the Heralds coverage of him to be unfair. He frequently attacked the newspaper in speeches around the province, and on April 28 suggested that his followers boycott it and other unfriendly newspapers. The boycott was successful to the extent that it drove at least one newspaper out of business. The Herald responded to the boycott by asking [...] "Is everyone opposed to the political opinions and plans of Mr. Aberhart to be boycotted?

5000|$|Futaisi and David Briginshaw, {{editor-in-chief}} of the International Railway Journal, have stated that the low price of oil and minerals {{that has resulted in}} budget deficits among GCC members is the primary reason hindering the project. Briginshaw said, [...] "Low oil prices affect investment, and obviously Oman's project is designed to take minerals to the coast, so if there isn't demand it brings the whole project into question." [...] The project was first conceived during an era of high oil prices. Unlike the EU, the GCC is not economically integrated, and states act independently and pursue their own policies sometimes creating competing <b>economic</b> <b>agendas.</b> Countries have chosen to give priority to their own domestic rail networks over the Gulf Railway, concerned that they may construct lines towards the border before their neighbour sufficiently completes work on their portion of the project. Other concerns hindering the project are visa issues for non-GCC nationals, illegal migration, smuggling, competing <b>economic</b> <b>agendas</b> and disagreements about where the lines should meet.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>agenda</b> under {{development}} initially focused on short-term measures intended {{to hold off}} widespread economic losses so that a longer-term <b>economic</b> <b>agenda</b> could then be formulated. That approach subsequently shifted to a longer-term stimulus plan, with a goal of creating 2.5 million jobs over a two-year period. With a cost of $700 to $800billion, the stimulus plan would cost {{more than a quarter}} million dollars per job created (divide 750 billion by 2,500,000 yielding $300,000). In a nationally televised interview on December 7, he acknowledged that his agenda has changed over the past month, and that a short-term stimulus package had again become his first priority.
