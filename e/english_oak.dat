5|$|A {{journalist}} {{from the}} Eastern Daily Press {{reported on the}} head in March 1967, stating that it had undergone laboratory tests which had established it to be made out of 2200-year-old <b>English</b> <b>oak.</b> Howard told the reporter that when living in Norwood Hill, Surrey, the race car driver Donald Campbell rubbed the head of Atho for luck before making his attempts to break the world land speed record. In July 2008, Howard's son Peter confirmed to the researcher Melissa Seims that he had witnessed his father constructing the Head, {{and that it was}} thus fake. Seims suggested that the design of the head had been inspired by an older folkloric artefact, the Dorset Ooser.|$|E
5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included <b>English</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E

5|$|Hengistbury Head forms {{part of the}} Christchurch Harbour Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and in May 1990 was {{declared}} a Local Nature Reserve. The head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight red data book species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces Christchurch Harbour, and is contiguous with the reed beds of Wick Fields. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the heathland on Warren Hill to freshwater ponds, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The woodland (known as Withybed Wood) is home to <b>English</b> <b>oak</b> and silver birch amongst many other trees, and is of particular interest, {{as it is the}} only such area to be shown on an 1811 Ordnance Survey map of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area. In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as Barn Field. This, combined with gorse eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an ecological {{analysis of the}} growth in thickness of monumental <b>English</b> <b>oaks</b> {{in relation to the}} age of trees, their health status, and dust fall in the immediate environment. The Bayesian modeling of empirical data was proposed via the MCMC technique- known as Gibbs sampling in the BUGS software. The usefulness of the methodology, was accentuated in such ecological assessments...|$|R
50|$|Species of acorn {{that contain}} {{large amounts of}} tannins are very bitter, astringent, and {{potentially}} irritating if eaten raw. This is particularly true of the acorns of American red <b>oaks</b> and <b>English</b> <b>oaks.</b> The acorns of white oaks, being much lower in tannins, are nutty in flavor; this characteristic is enhanced if the acorns are given a light roast before grinding.|$|R

25|$|The chantry is {{now used}} for the choir stalls and organ. The present organ was built by Peter Collins or Redbourne in 1986, and replaces an earlier {{instrument}} built by Walker. Some of the Walker pipework was incorporated into the modern instrument. The organ has two manuals, the brightly coloured casing is in <b>English</b> <b>oak</b> and decorations are in sycamore wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{reserve is}} located on the North European Plain, {{north-east}} of Warsaw, parallel to the Vistula River and is characterized by a high diversity of lowland habitats with dune belts separated by swamp areas and a mixture of forest types. The forests are principally composed of a mixture of grey willow (Salix cinerea), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), arctic dwarf birch (Betula humilis) <b>English</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris).|$|E
25|$|Only {{the insects}} {{of the forests}} have been {{reliably}} inventoried, but more than 70 species of insect are already inscribed {{on the list of}} species endangered in Sweden. The presence of dead wood favors the presence of numerous insects. Most of the forest insects live in the sapwood or between the sapwood and the bark. In particular, the Norway spruce and the <b>English</b> <b>oak</b> are the trees supporting the greatest richness in insects.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, a new visual {{identity}} for SOAS was launched {{to be used}} in print, digital media and around the campus. The SOAS tree symbol, first implemented in 1989, was redrawn and recoloured in gold, with the new symbol incorporating the leaves of ten trees, including the <b>English</b> <b>Oak</b> representing England; the Bodhi, Coral Bark Maple, Teak representing Asia; the Mountain Acacia, African Pear, Lasiodiscus representing Africa; and the Date Palm, Pomegranate and Ghaf representing the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Ealing Common {{preserves}} a {{large area}} of open space with fine avenues of horse chestnut trees, {{most of which were}} planted in the late Victorian period, following the purchase of the common land by the Ealing Local Board. The northern part of the common has a large <b>English</b> <b>oak</b> tree at its centre, and London plane trees are also found with the horse chestnuts {{around the perimeter of the}} common. Charles Jones was the borough surveyor responsible for the layout.|$|E
25|$|Archimedes {{was built}} 1838, by Henry Wimshurst in London. According to F. P. Smith himself, {{the ship was}} {{constructed}} of <b>English</b> <b>oak,</b> but a later entry in Lloyd's Register indicates that parts of the keel at least were of Baltic fir. The ship was 125 feet long, 22½ feet wide, and 237 tons burthen. Built to a schooner pattern, with classic hull lines and a slender, raking funnel and masts, she was considered by contemporaries to be a beautiful vessel.|$|E
50|$|Elms, willows, and poplars {{were planted}} {{around the house}} by the Reverend Pierce Galliard Smith, who was Rector at St Johns for fifty-one years from 1855 until 1906. The elms in the park today are descended from his plantings with some {{survivors}} from one hundred years ago. Nearly seven hundred trees remain in the park, of which just over five hundred are English elms (Ulmus procera). About a hundred are <b>English</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus robur).|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 1944 an RAF Halifax bomber MZ519-LKU {{crashed on}} the south side of the village on its return to RAF Burn near York. The Halifax had been on a mission to destroy a V1 flying bomb site in Nazi-occupied France. All on board were killed. The site of the crash has a large {{memorial}} set before of a copse of <b>English</b> <b>oaks</b> and Canadian maples dedicated to the Canadian and British crewmen.|$|R
50|$|Centuries-old <b>English</b> <b>oaks,</b> elms, maples {{and ashes}} are slowly being {{replaced}} by spontaneous vegetation, represented by acacias, trees of heaven, elders, ivy, pines and nettle trees. The highest level of species assortment {{can be found in}} the western part of the park, while in the eastern part, nearer to the city centre, mainly lindens and oaks are diffused. A botanically relevant arboretum is situated in the garden of the Scuola di Guerra Aerea (School of Air War).|$|R
