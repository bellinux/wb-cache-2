40|$|Introduction. Congenital {{pseudarthrosis}} {{of tibia}} {{is a rare}} congenital deformity with progressive evolution. Treatment is vague and difficult, and many methods have been used - from once mandatory early amputation to contemporary operative (Ilizarov method, free microvascular fibular graft) and adjuvant methods (electrostimulation, biphosphonates, bone morphogenetic protein). We present the usage of once popular method of <b>homologous</b> <b>graft</b> insertion and intramedullary fixation. Case Outline. This is a case report of male patient with pseudarthrosis involving both crural bones (Boyd type 5), diagnosed in neonatal age. Early conservative treatment was unsuccessful, so child never initiated gait. At {{the age of three}} and a half years, operative treatment was applied: resection of pseudarthrosis on both tibia and fibula, and osteoplasty of tibia using cylindric <b>homologous</b> <b>graft</b> and intramedullary fixation with transtarsal Steinman pin, followed by long leg cast immobilization. Pin was removed after ten months, and physical therapy was initiated 1. 5 year after surgery, with initial to partial weight bearing and short leg cast throughout another year. Two and a half years after surgery complete union of graft was documented, and then full weight bearing was allowed. At final visit, five years and three months after surgery, shin axis was correct, leg lengths were equal, and child had normal walk with full range of motion. X-ray showed complete union of both tibia and fibula. Conclusion. Despite bad prognostic factors (young age, severe deformity), utilization of obsolete and almost forgotten treatment methods can provide excellent result.

We present such a case, in which the UC-OGC presented atypically as a cystic lesion following acute pancreatitis and led to late diagnosis. Presentation of caseA 75 -year-old female patient, who had suffered acute pancreatitis three years ago, was referred with a diagnosis of osteoclast-like giant cell (OGC) tumor of the head of pancreas. She had suffered acute pancreatitis three years ago. Two years ago she developed abdominal pain, steatorrhea and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography imaging showed a cystic mass in the head of the pancreas (maximum diameter 4 cm). The initial diagnosis was pancreatic pseudocyst; however as the mass gradually increased in size and the patient continued to be symptomatic, a CT-guided biopsy was performed. Histological examination revealed an OGC pancreatic tumor. In laparotomy a large (9 cm) encapsulated heterogeneous mass was found with partial involvement of the common hepatic artery. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed and the involved part of the common hepatic artery was replaced with a <b>homologous</b> <b>graft</b> from the major saphenous vein. Post-operative course was uneventful. Histology revealed an undifferentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma with OGCs. She survived 10 months after the operation. DiscussionPancreatic undifferentiated carcinomas with OGCs are very rare neoplasms and can present with an atypical clinical picture.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 27 patients who underwent surgical treatment for femoral reconstruction following mechanical failure of total hip arthroplasty (12 cases) and periprosthetic fractures (15 cases), using a cortical structural <b>homologous</b> bone <b>graft</b> and cemented implants, between June 1999 and February 2008. Of these, 21 fulfilled all the criteria required for this study. The patients underwent pre and postoperative clinical assessments using the Harris Hip Score. Preoperative, immediate postoperative and late postoperative radiographs were also evaluated, with comparisons of fracture consolidation, radiographic signs of graft consolidation, changes to the bone stock and femoral bone quality, and femoral alignment. Results: Nine patients (42. 9 %) underwent femoral reconstruction following mechanical failure of total hip arthroplasty and 12 cases (57. 1 %) underwent femoral reconstruction following periprosthetic fracture. Regarding the postoperative clinical classification, the results were considered satisfactory in 85. 7 % of the cases and unsatisfactory in 14. 3 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential of fresh frozen homologous and autogenous grafts, associated or not with autogenous bone marrow, to form bone. Sixty titanium cylinders were used, and were fixed to the skulls of 30 rabbits. These cylinders were filled with (A) autogenous bone (AM) autogenous bone associated with the bone marrow (H) fresh frozen homologous bone (HM) fresh frozen homologous bone associated with the bone marrow (M) pure autogenous bone marrow and (C) blood clot. the animals were sacrificed after 02 and 03 months. After clinical evaluation, the samples were stained with hematoxylin, eosin and Mallory Trichrome dyes for optical microscopy analysis and histomorphometric analysis. Experimental groups that received mineralized materials (A, AM, H, HM) showed the best bone formation results, presenting no statistical difference between them (P > 0. 05). Groups that did not receive mineralized materials (M and C) showed the worst results (P < 0. 05), but the M group showed better results than the C group. Most of the autogenous and homologous bone particles were resorbed and there was a larger amount of residual particles in the <b>homologous</b> <b>graft</b> (H, HM) when compared with the autogenous graft (A, AM; P < 0. 05). These findings suggest that fresh frozen homologous grafts produced similar amounts of new bone when compared with the autogenous grafts. However, the amount of residual bone particles was larger in the homogenous groups, which may indicate a slower remodeling process. the homologous fresh frozen bone seems to be a good osteoconductive material. the use of only autogenous bone marrow showed better results when compared to the bood clot. However, this research indicates that association with mineralized materials is required.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{improvements}} achieved in antibiotic therapy, severe aortic infection resulting in mycotic aneurysms {{is still a}} highly lethal disease and surgical management remains a challenging task. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 43 patients with severe aortic infections were analyzed and separated in four groups: (1) Infections of the aortic root Ventriculo-aortic disconnection due to deep aortic infection (6 patients). Two patients were operated using homo-composit grafts. Of the 6 patients total, one died early and two died late during a mean follow-up of 6 years. The two patients with homografts are still alive. (2) Infections of the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. In situ repair for mycotic aneurysmal lesions of the ascending aorta was performed in 6 patients using synthetic graft material in 4 / 6, biological material in 1 / 6 and direct suture in 1 / 6. Two patients had to be reoperated; one of them died early. There was no recurrent infection during a mean follow-up of 6 years. (3) Infections of the descending thoracic and thoraco-abdominal aorta in-situ repair for mycotic aneurysmal lesions of the descending and thoraco-abdominal aorta was performed in 12 patients using homografts in five. Two patients died early and two other patients died late during a mean follow-up of 6 years. (4) Infections of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. In this series of 19 patients with mycotic infrarenal aortic aneurysms, in situ reconstruction was performed in 12 (5 / 12 with homografts) and extra-anatomic reconstruction (axillo-femoral bypass) was performed in 7. Hospital mortality was 5 / 19 patients and another 5 / 19 patients died during a mean follow-up of 6 years. One of the early deaths was due to aortic stump rupture. Two patients with axillo-femoral reconstructions were later converted to descending-thoracic-aortic-bifemoral bypasses. Five thromboses of axillo-femoral bypasses were observed {{in three of the}} seven patients with extra-anatomic repairs. RESULTS: Infections of the aortic root, the ascending aorta and the aortic arch are approached with total cardio-pulmonary bypass, using cardioplegic myocardial protection and deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest if necessary. Proximal unloading and distal support using partial cardiopulmonary bypass is preferred for repair of infected descending and thoracoabdominal aortic lesions, whereas no such adjuncts are required for repair of infected infrarenal aortic lesions.

30|$|Maxillary sinus {{augmentation}} {{is indicated}} {{when there is}} an inadequate vertical alveolar bone height to effectively support surgically placed dental implants. The sinus elevation procedure requires grafting bone material onto the sinus floor to regenerate sufficient vertical alveolar bone height [1, 2]. The ideal bone grafting material should be biocompatible, possess no risk of disease transmission, promote bone regeneration, and have mechanical stability throughout the healing period [3]. Autologous bone is the “gold standard” of bone grafting materials in maxillary sinus lifts due to its osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic potential [4, 5]. The harvesting of autologous bone is highly invasive and time-consuming and has variable outcomes for donor and recipient sites [5, 6]. Current biomaterials like xenografts, <b>homologous</b> <b>grafts,</b> and synthetic grafts circumvent the risks of autologous grafts but lack cellularity [7]. Bone marrow aspirate concentrates (BMACs) alone and biomaterials enriched with BMACs were proposed to have the potential to increase the success of sinus floor elevation surgeries, rather than biomaterials alone [8]. Autologous bone marrow is a known source of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts [9] and produce vascular endothelial growth factors [10].|$|R

40|$|Abstract In narrow {{alveolar}} ridge many surgical approaches exist, and {{the most}} frequently used is bone graftingThe subperiosteal tunneling approach is a minimal safety procedure that allows to allocate the graft in a space that is obtained between the soft tissues and the underlying bone, through an access rapresented by one single incision on the mesial limit of the bone defect. A 55 -year-old caucasian woman with a severe bone atrophy in the maxillary arch was treated with horizontal bone augmentation. A mucoperiosteal tunnel with a periosteal elevator through one single incision of moderate dimensions per hemiarch, insertion of tissue bank ilium bicortical bone(FFB) and a consequent complete prosthetic-implant rehabilitation was realized. The tunnel technique provided primary intention closure of the surgical wound, avoiding dehiscences and infections, and reducing the edema and the post-operative discomfort for the patient. Clinical and histological studies support the use of FFB and {{it has been suggested that}} the results of a <b>graft</b> with <b>homologous</b> and with autologus bone can be comparable, even though the healing phase is more critical and longer for the allograft. The combination of <b>homologous</b> <b>grafts</b> with the tunnel technique reduces significantly the surgical trauma and the postoperative discomfort, as well as the risk of exposure of the graft during the healing phase, with the risk of graft failiure. In our experience, onlay grafting with frozen bone is a predictable technique for horizontal augmentation...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of tritiated thymidine labeled lymphoid cells sensitized to homologous tissues into non-sensitized isologous hosts resulted in accelerated rejection of <b>homologous</b> skin <b>grafts</b> in the recipients. Despite 33 per cent label of the suspension, only rare labeled sensitized lymphoid cells {{could be found}} at the site of rejection. Passive {{transfer of}} sensitized lymphoid cells in millipore chambers implanted subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in non-sensitized isologous hosts resulted in accelerated homograft rejection in the recipients. Transfer of transplantation immunity could not be accomplished with serum from sensitized hosts. The rejection of homologous tissues without the physical presence of the sensitized cell at the graft site suggested that a humoral agent produced by the cell was capable of rejecting the homograft...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is evaluate the efficacy of <b>homologous</b> pericardium <b>grafts</b> for internal inguinal ring closure in horses, comparing mechanical or manual laparoscopic suture. Cross over study, using six healthy intact male Mangalarga breed horses aged between 3 and 12 years. Horses were operated under general anesthesia in 25 º Trendelenburg position. Five laparoscopic portals were employed. Pericardium grafts measuring 4 x 5 cm were anchored covering the left and right internal inguinal rings using either manual intracorporeal suture or laparoscopic stapler. Horses were followed-up during 11 weeks when were submitted to a laparoscopic control. Surgical time, trans and postoperative complications and effectiveness of internal inguinal closure were evaluated and statistically analyzed. The level of significance was set at 5 % P< 0. 05. The procedures were realized without complications and the mean time required for manual and mechanical suture procedures differed significantly (67. 8 ± 15. 3 and 14. 1 ± 2. 1 min respectively; P< 0. 05). All manually sutured grafts remained in place and partial suture dehiscence with incomplete occlusion of the internal inguinal ring was observed in two stapled grafts. Non-severe complications were observed trans or postoperatively. One synechiae and three omental adhesions were observed by laparoscopic control on day 77, but without clinical relevance in the evaluated period. The use of <b>homologous</b> pericardium <b>grafts</b> was effectiveness to internal inguinal ring closure by laparoscopy. Mechanical suture was faster to perform than manual, but provided less satisfactory results concerning safety of graft fixation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analysed}} {{new strategies}} for the prophylaxis of corneal graft rejection. In the first section clinical data of patients of our clinic were analysed. It could be demonstrated that glaucoma is a main risk factor for chronic endothelial cell loss. Moreover our data could show {{for the first time}} that a chronic subclinical immune reaction contributes to endothelial cell loss of <b>homologous</b> <b>grafts.</b> Broad experimental investigations on topical application of immunomodulatory substances are described in the second section. Topical formulations of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus / everolimus are demonstrated for the first time. Our examinations showed that the best preparation of MMF is a cyclodextrin formulation (MMF-CD) whereas sirolimus / everolimus is best prepared as a microemulsion. Application of MMF-CD formulation can obtain high concentration in the aqueous humour whereas topical sirolimus permeates the cornea only after removal of the epithelium. Topical MMF and sirolimus do not prolong experimental corneal graft survival in a rat model whereas grafts survive longer under topical therapy with everolimus. Moreover, topical application of MMF and sirolimus / everolimus remain interesting therapeutic options for other immune mediated diseases of the ocular surface like immune mediated corneal ulcers or atopic keratoconjunctivitis. In the third section therapeutic options of gene therapeutic strategies for prophylaxis of corneal graft rejection were analysed. Own investigations on this topic showed that liposome mediated cytokine gene transfer (interleukin 10) to corneal endothelial cells in culture is possible. For transfection of organ cultured corneas transfection efficiency of adenoviral gene transfer is by far higher. Nevertheless on the way to clinical application of gene therapy for the prophylaxis of corneal graft rejection numerous further problems have to be solved...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of transplantation immunity was accomplished in inbred guinea pigs with tritiated thymidine-labeled lymphoid cells sensitized to homologous tissues. Autoradiographs of the <b>homologous</b> skin <b>graft</b> sites disclosed {{the presence of}} relatively few or no labeled cells {{at the site of}} rejection. Passive {{transfer of}} transplantation immunity was also accomplished with sensitized lymphoid cells enclosed in cell-impenetrable Millipore chambers. Previous studies with passive transfer of tuberculin sensitivity in guinea pigs revealed that the specifically sensitized cells could be easily found at the site of challenge in the presence of specific antigen and were ineffective when enclosed in Millipore chambers. It appeared, then, that the homograft reaction and delayed sensitivity of tuberculin type were achieved by different immunologic mechanisms within the same species...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone deficits of the midface can be {{observed}} following tumor surgery, facial traumas or malformations, and can determine aesthetic deformities requiring surgical corrections. The goal {{of this study is}} to illustrate the 23 years experience of the Maxillo-Facial Department of the "La Sapienza" University of Rome, in surgical correction of middle third bone loss for aesthetic improvement, and to compare postsurgical results from the use of biomaterials and <b>homologous</b> bone <b>grafts.</b> METHODS: From January 1977 to January 2000, 18 patients were surgically treated with bone grafts for bone deficit of the midface requiring aesthetic improvements, and 23 received biomaterial placement in the same district. A retrospective analysis regarding aesthetic improvements following corrective (reconstructive) surgery was carried out in order to compare long-term results obtained with bone grafts and biomaterials. RESULTS: Of the 19 implants of the zygomatic bone, 1 patient suffered from infection, observ-ed on the 8 th day, following iliac bone graft in the maxillary area. Of the 32 prostheses, 7 became infected and in 1 case the material became exposed: Proplast(R) became infected 2 times, Gore-tex(R) 3 times and 1 time became exposed; 2 of the 24 Medpor(R) implants resulted in infection. The employment of bone graft obtained a good short term aesthetic result. Medpor(R) employment, was evaluated as an optimal aesthetic improvement. We cannot evaluate the results obtained with Gore-tex(R) and Proplast(R) because of the few cases treated. Anyway we consider unsatisfactory the corrections obtained with these 2 materials. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Homologous</b> bone <b>grafts</b> are still considered as the best choice when a further fixture positioning is planned for prosthetic rehabilitation of the alveolar ridge of the upper jaw or mandible. At the present time, some biomaterials are the definitive solution for restoring facial harmony in the 3 spatial dimensions...|$|R
40|$|From 1995 to 2005, {{arthrodesis}} with {{a reconstruction}} plate was performed for eight shoulders. The average follow-up period was 44  months. The indications for shoulder arthrodesis were joint destruction as a sequel of tuberculous arthritis, malignant bone tumour, pyogenic arthritis, failed arthrodesis and paralysis of the brachial plexus. The evaluation criteria included bony union and pain. Two cases of malignant tumour required an <b>homologous</b> bone <b>graft</b> due to severe bone deficit—a fracture {{that occurred in}} the distal part of the arthrodesed shoulder after removing the plate. With the exception of these two cases, severe pain or other complications did not occur in any other case. Shoulder arthrodesis with a reconstruction plate was judged to be a useful method for glenohumeral salvage in cases without severe bone deficit. Further, additional treatment methods should be considered to prevent fracture that may occur as a result of severe bone deficit...|$|R
