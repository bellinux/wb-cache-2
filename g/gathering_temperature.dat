Type, {{amount and}} {{composition}} of gases which form in rocks and coals during a metamorphism process depend {{on a number of}} factors in particular genetic type of original matter, way and conditions of its <b>gathering,</b> <b>temperature,</b> pressure and geological time. Sorption tests were done by the volumetric method, with the use of adsorption micro-burettes. A major advantage of the measurement set-up is that the surplus amounts of adsorbate can be used in experiments, which is of particular importance when handling sorbents with heterogeneous structure, such as hard coals. Sorbates used in the test program were the vapours of hexane, hex- 1 -ene, heptane, hept- 1 -ene, octane and benzene. Measurement results seem to corroborate the hypothesis that sorption of polar substance vapours is chiefly a surface process. Polarity of hard coals, mostly associated with the presence of reactive oxygen groups (nitrogen and sulphuric groups), largely affects the sorption of polar substances and in a most characteristic manner controls the sorption of apolar ones. In the case of the latter, sorption is induced by the action of the dispersive interaction force between the coal surface and the sorbate's polar molecules. The pattern of sorption isotherms indicates that the presence of dual bond affects the sorbent-sorbate interactions and hence the sorption capacity of investigated coals.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the first}} decade of the twenty-first century, more than 6000 Argo floats have been {{launched}} over the World Ocean, <b>gathering</b> <b>temperature</b> and salinity data from the upper 2000 m, at a 10 -day or so sampling period. Meanwhile their deep displacements can be used to map the ocean circulation at their drifting depth (mostly around 1000 m). A comprehensive processing of the whole Argo dataset collected prior to 1 January 2010 has been performed to produce a world-wide dataset of deep displacements. This numerical atlas, named ANDRO, after a traditional dance of Brittany meaning a swirl, comprises some 600 000 deep displacements. These displacements, based on Argo or GPS surface locations only, have been fully checked and corrected for possible errors found in the public Argo data files (due to incorrect decoding or instrumental failure). Park pressures measured by the floats while drifting at depth are preserved in ANDRO (less than 2 % of the park pressures are unknown) : 63 % of the float displacements are in the layer (900, 1100) dbar with a good (more or less uniform) degree of coverage of all the oceans, except around Antarctica (south of 60 °S). Two deeper layers [...] (1400, 1600) and (1900, 2100) dbar [...] are also sampled (11 % and 8 % of the float displacements, respectively) but with poorer geographical coverage.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} studies {{was performed to}} investigate two separate fluid impingement flow systems intended for removal of particles from a surface or deposition of particles onto a surface. One of these flow systems is generated using a nozzle that incorporates both tilted jets and suction to create {{what we call a}} 2 ̆ 2 bounded vortex flow 2 ̆ 2, consisting of an annular swirling jet and a wall-normal vortex with axial upflow into a suction outlet. The other flow system is generated by a combination of acoustic streaming and substrate heating from an ultrasonic source. The primary methods used in the study for flow field measurements included laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV). Thermocouples are utilized for <b>gathering</b> <b>temperature</b> information from the ultrasonic induced flow. For the bounded vortex flow, different jet/suction flow rates and different nozzle-substrate separation distances were examined. In the acoustic-generated flow system, different acoustic intensities and transducer-substrate separation distances and different choices of substrate material were examined. Both flow systems achieve high levels of shear stress on the impingement surface via a combination of flow oriented toward and/or away from the surface and via formation of vortex structures near the impingement surface. In the bounded flow configuration, the vortex flow is oriented with axis normal to the impingement surface, whereas in the acoustic-generated flow a series of vortex rings form with axes parallel to the impingement surface. For both flow fields, conditions are observed with high impingement surface shear stress that are well suited to particle removal from the impingement surface. However, as the variables controlling the flows are varied, other conditions are observed in which the flow fields become unstable, leading to oscillatory flows that generally have much smaller shear stress values on the impingement surface. The rate of fluid mixing, as characterized by upward and downward flows normal to the impingement surface, is also generally decreased after these flow transitions have occurred, implying that the unstable flows will be less suited for both particle deposition on and particle removal from the impingement surface...|$|E

The network consists of ten static buoy nodes and one mobile robotic boat for real-time in-situ measurements and analysis of chemical, physical and biologically pertinent phenomena governing the abundance of micro-organisms at relevant spatio-temporal scales. The goal of the network is to obtain high-resolution information on the spatial and temporal distribution of plankton assemblages in aquatic environments using the in situ presence afforded by the network, and to make possible network-enabled robotic sampling of hydrographic features of interest. This work constitutes advances in (1) real-time observing in aquatic ecosystems and (2) sensor- actuated sampling for biological analysis. Ultimately such systems {{will be able to}} establish patterns in the sensed data, and use their mobility to adapt sample collection, a major step forward in the use of embedded networked sensing in aquatic ecosystems. The field work has demonstrated the basic functionality of the system. The data collected from the deployments revealed interesting spatio-temporal patterns of chlorophyll, and were useful to validate the design of the buoys and the boat. Static buoys provide low-resolution spatial sampling with high temporal resolution while a mobile robot boat provides high resolution spatial sampling with low temporal resolution. As part of the demonstration, we will be having our robotic boat at the event equipped with its sensor suite. The robotic boat is equipped with sensors for navigation, instrumentation for data <b>gathering</b> (<b>temperature</b> and chlorophyll) and can communicate with other entities in the environment over wireless 802. 11 b network and exchange information with them.

30|$|The Curie {{temperature}} {{is an essential}} magnetic property, but it only shows an incredibly narrow view of the plethora of information essential to fully characterizing magnetic materials. Yet, even the dimmest of views can be of great utility when combined with other complementary information about a material. The modification of vertical TGA systems provides a low-barrier of entry to <b>gathering</b> Curie <b>temperature</b> data, and when integrated with DSC {{it can be done}} at low marginal cost to collecting other data about material transformations. The Continuous Wavelet Transformation data analysis technique brings a great degree of automation and repeatability to magnetic balance based Curie temperature determination with analysis and post processing of the magnetic balance data reduced from many minutes of unreliable hand fitting to a few seconds of scripting. These gains in speed and reproducibility are particularly important as the rapidly growing field of materials modeling continues to yield ab initio magnetic material predictions that demand experimental verification. Promising multifunctional magnetic compounds predicted via computation and verified with these techniques can also be characterized for processing and service optimization as the shape and location of magnetic transitions contains information about the phase transformations within these materials. The Curie temperatures of select Heusler alloys were measured via this new technique with a maximum standard error of 2.5 % while showing good agreement with previously reported results for most compounds.|$|R

The Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) One heat sensing camera was chosen to measure the canopy temperature of a peanut crop grown in a red ferrosol at the Bundaberg Research Facility. This camera was matched to an iPhone S 6. Canopy temperatures were recorded for two treatments, irrigation using the FLIR One technology and dry. Solar Noon (12 : 00 – 2 : 00 pm) canopy temperature in the irrigated treatment averaged 28. 6 - 32 ° C and the canopy temperature in the dry treatments were between 30 and 36 ° C. The camera angle for <b>gathering</b> canopy <b>temperatures</b> of the FLIR One camera should be at 75 °. There were no visual canopy wilting symptoms displayed by the water stressed peanut crop canopy. When using thermal imaging you should manage the peanut crop to maintain the crop canopy temperature in irrigated peanut plants from 2 - 7 °C below air temperature or below 35 °C. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the FLIR One camera can measure peanut canopy temperatures and can be used as a tool to indicate that the crop may need irrigating before visually observing plant stress symptoms such as wilting.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simultaneous estimation of multiphase flow rate and stream composition {{has been developed}} to be applied in a multiple restriction assembly composed of two orifice meters and a cage trim valve. These differential pressure elements are typical instrument installed in the wellhead of production wells in Urucu field (Petrobras/Brazil). To deliver composition and rates four steps were done: 1) a multi-rate well test - an experimental procedure carried out in real operation conditions. 2) modeling of multiphase flow expansion process through cage trim valves. 3) performance and validation of multiphase flow through orifice plate meters {{by the use of}} homogeneous and slip models. 4) tuning and metering procedures for coupling the valve and orifice plate models. The last investigation developed a full field production optimization procedure honouring pressure and routing constraints to be applied in multiple wells. Essentially, the research performed in this thesis is an experimental work followed by numerical modeling. Model errors and performance validation were calculated on the basis of measured data from a multi-rate well test. This field scale experiment consisted in a sequential step response test followed by a transient and a steady state period “a priori” to each next step. Three wells named Well 1, Well 2 and Well 3 were single routed to a test separator. Two types of well performance were investigated: 1) production with stream composition variation caused by gas/water coning. 2) production with steady state composition. Eight wellhead variables were monitored: two orifice plate differential pressures, the differential pressure and temperature through the cage valve, the downstream choke pressure, the wellhead pressure and <b>temperature</b> and the <b>gathering</b> system <b>temperature.</b> The field scale experiments generated a database composed by 1781 test points, averaged in 30 minutes interval.

The first satellite of the GCOM-W (Water) series will be GCOM-W 1 with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer- 2 (AMSR 2) onboard. AMSR 2 is a successor of AMSR on the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) and AMSR for EOS (AMSR-E) on NASA’s Aqua satellite. Basic performance of AMSR 2 will be {{similar to that of}} AMSR-E based on the minimum requirement of data continuity of AMSR-E, with several enhancements including larger main reflector (2. 0 m), additional channels in C-band receiver, and improved calibration system. AMSR-E was launched in 2002 and is still <b>gathering</b> global brightness <b>temperatures</b> for more than eight years beyond its scheduled operational period of three years. Despite the warm-load calibration issue, the instrument indicates good performance in long-term stability. Based on the AMSR and AMSR-E experience, several design changes were made for the AMSR 2 warm load, including changes in thermal stabilization and solar light shielding. Pre-launch testing is being performed, such as antenna pattern and detector nonlinearity measurements. The testing results will be reflected in sensor calibration model. After the launch, a deep-space calibration maneuver will be performed just one time during the initial checkout period to check consistency between main reflector and cold sky mirror, as well as to see scan biases for cold brightness temperatures. Further post-launch calibration activities will be performed, including cross calibration among similar microwave radiometers.
