However, larger animals are taken only sporadically {{due to the}} fact only large males typically attack very large prey and large ungulates and other sizeable wild mammals are only sparsely distributed in this species' range, outside of a few key areas such as the Sundarbans. Off-setting this, goats, water buffalo and wild boar/pigs have been introduced to many of the areas occupied by saltwater crocodiles and returned to feral states to varying degrees and thus can amply support large crocodiles. Any type of domestic livestock, such as chicken (Gallus <b>gallus</b> <b>domesticus),</b> sheep (Ovis aries), pigs, horses (Equus ferus caballus) and cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), and domesticated animals/pets may be eaten if given the opportunity. As a seagoing species, the saltwater crocodile also preys on a variety of saltwater bony fish and other marine animals, including sea snakes, sea turtles, sea birds, dugongs (Dugong dugon), rays (including large sawfish), and small sharks. Most witnessed acts of predation on marine animals have occurred in coastal waters or within sight of land, with female sea turtles and their babies caught during mating season when the turtles are closer to shore and bull sharks being the only largish shark with a strong propensity to patrol brackish and fresh waters. However, there is evidence that saltwater crocodiles do hunt while out in the open seas, based upon the remains of pelagic fishes that dwell only miles away from land being found in their stomachs.|$|E
500|$|Chickens are medium-sized, chunky {{birds with}} an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, {{and have more}} exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural {{surroundings}} search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except {{as a result of}} perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus <b>gallus</b> <b>domesticus)</b> is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from [...] grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.|$|E

40|$|A {{new family}} of related {{endogenous}} proviruses, existing at 50 to 100 copies per haploid genome and distinguishable by remarkably short long terminal repeats, {{has been described}} for domestic chickens (<b>Gallus</b> <b>gallus</b> subsp <b>domesticus).</b> In this communication, by using Southern blot analysis and probes derived from both internal viral sequences and locus-specific, cellular flanking sequences, we studied the genetic distribution of this family of moderately repetitive avian endogenous retroviruses within the genomes of four Gallus species. Eight inbred lines of domestic chickens, the evolutionary progenitor to the domestic chicken (red jungle fowl), and two more distantly related species (grey and green jungle fowl) were studied. All Gallus species harbored this class of elements, although the different lines of domestic chickens and different species of jungle fowl bore distinguishable complements of the proviral loci. Jungle fowl appeared to have fewer copies than domestic chickens. For three randomly isolated proviral loci, domestic chickens (G. <b>gallus</b> subsp. <b>domesticus)</b> and red jungle fowl (G. gallus subsp. gallus) showed only a proviral state, whereas the most primitive and divergent of the jungle fowl, the green jungle fowl (G. varius), consistently demonstrated only preintegration states or disparate alleles. The presence of this family in all Gallus species and of related sequences in other genera suggests that a primordial founding integration event occurred prior to the evolutionary separation of Gallus species and possibly related genera. Additionally, at least one proviral locus has been acquired subsequent to speciation, indicating that this family was actively infectious after the primary founding event. This conserved, repetitive proviral family appears to represent the vestigial remnant of an avian retrovirus class related to and evolutionarily more ancient than the Rous-associated virus- 0 family of avian endogenous retroviruses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of embryonic microclimate on the behavioural development of birds remains unexplored. In this study, we experimentally tested whether chronic exposure to suboptimal temperatures engendered plasticity in {{the expression of}} fear-related behaviours and in {{the expression of the}} corticotropin-releasing factor in the brains of domestic chicks (<b>Gallus</b> g. <b>domesticus).</b> We compared the neurobehavioural phenotypes of a control group of chicks incubated in an optimal thermal environment (37. 8 [*]°C) with those of a group of experimental chicks exposed chronically in ovo to suboptimal temperatures (27. 2 [*]°C for 1 [*]hour twice a day). Chronic exposure to a suboptimal temperature delayed hatching and decreased growth rate and experimental chicks had higher neophobic responses than controls in novel food and novel environment tests. In addition, experimental chicks showed higher expression of corticotropin-releasing factor than did controls in nuclei of the amygdala, a structure involved in the regulation of fear-related behaviours. In this study, we report the first evidence of the strong but underappreciated role of incubation microclimate on the development of birds’ behaviour and its neurobiological correlates...|$|R

40|$|ABSTR ACT: Complete blood-gas barrier breaks (BGBBs) and epithelial-epithelial cells {{connections}} breaks (E-ECCBs) were enumerated in {{the lungs}} of free range chickens, <b>Gallus</b> <b>gallus</b> variant <b>domesticus</b> after vascular perfusion at different pressures. The E-ECCBs surpassed the BGBBs by a factor of ~ 2. This showed that the former parts of the gas exchange tissue were structurally weaker or more vulnerable to failure than the latter. The differences {{in the numbers of}} BGBBs and E-ECCBs in the different regions of the lung supplied with blood by the 4 main branches of the pulmonary artery (PA) cor-responded with the diameters of the blood vessels, the angles at which they bifurcated from the PA, and the positions along the PA where they branched off. Most of the BGBBs and the E-ECCBs occurred in the regions supplied by the accessory- and the caudomedial branches: the former is the narrowest branch and the first blood vessel to separate from the PA while the latter is the most direct extension of the PA and is the widest. The E-ECCBs appeared to separate and fail from tensing of the blood capillary walls, as the perfusion- and intramural pressures increased. Compared to the mammalian lungs on which data are available, i. e., those of the rabbit, the dog, and the horse, the blood-gas barrier of the lung of free range chickens appears to be substantially stronger for its thinness...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} {{attributes of the}} free respiratory macrophages (FRMs) of the lung – air sac systems of the domestic fowl (<b>Gallus</b> <b>gallus</b> variant <b>domesticus)</b> and the muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) were {{compared with those of}} the alveolar macrophages of the lung of the black rat (Rattus rattus). The birds had significantly fewer FRMs compared to the rat. In the birds, the FRMs were found both in the lungs and in the air sacs. Under similar experimental conditions, the most robust FRMs were those of the domestic fowl followed by those of the rat and the duck. Flux of macrophages onto the respiratory surface from the subepithelial compartment and probably also from the pulmonary vasculature was observed in the birds but not in the rat. In the duck and the domestic fowl, a phagocytic epithelium that constituted over 70 % of the surface area of the blood–gas (tissue) barrier lines the atrial muscles, the atria and the infundibulae. The epithelial cells of the upper respiratory airways contain abundant lysosomes, suggesting a high lytic capacity. By inference, the various defence strategies in the avian lung may explain the dearth of FRMs on the respiratory surface. We counter-propose that rather than arising directly from paucity of FRMs, an aspect that has been over-stressed by most investigators, the purported high susceptibility of birds (particularly table birds) to respiratory ailments and afflictions may be explained by factors such as inadequate management and husbandry practices and severe genetic manipulation for fast growth and high productivity, manipulations that may have weakened cellular and immunological defences...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} female selection of copulation partners remains unresolved, particularly in polygamous species where males {{do not provide}} paternal care. In these species the possibility that direct benefits other than paternal care may {{play an important role}} in the evolution of female choice has received little attention. I tested whether direct benefits are associated with female choice in the polygamous feral fowl, <b>Gallus</b> g. <b>domesticus,</b> where females prefer socially dominant copulation partners and males do not care for the young but do provide females with three commodities: food, vigilance, and sperm. I used a combination of empirical and experimental data to show that male propensity to offer food and vigilance, but not sperm, was positively associated with male social status, suggesting that the provision of these resources may be costly and condition dependent in males. Copulation success was correlated with male status but not with the number of feedings a female received from a male, indicating that a female preferred dominant partners that in general provided any female with more food, rather than partners that provided only her with more food, consistent with the idea that females may use male resource provisioning as a proximate mechanism to assess male condition. Together, these results indicate that male resources provisioning is (1) tightly linked to male social status, (2) a potential indicator of male condition and possibly genetic quality, and (3) a potential criterion for females to select dominant partners, thus playing an important role in the evolution of partner choice even in polygamous species lacking paternal care.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that social {{learning}} helps animals either avoid noxious substances or identify food items, but evidence suggests that avian social learning is fundamentally different from that of mammals. In two experiments, we investigated whether the preferences of domestic hens, <b>Gallus</b> g. <b>domesticus,</b> for novel food were influenced by observing the feeding behaviour of conspecifics. In experiment 1, we attempted to confirm that birds can develop socially learnt aversions to unpalatable foods. Despite demonstrators showing a highly visible 'disgust reaction' after eating unpalatable coloured food, observers did not develop aversions to similarly coloured food. In experiment 2, we aimed to determine whether preferences for palatable food were socially learnt, and whether the extent of a demonstrator's preference for novel food affected the magnitude of the observer's socially learned preference. Demonstrators ate coloured food of standard or high palatability, or did not peck food at all. When the demonstrators pecked more frequently or fed more quickly from the food, the observers consumed a greater proportion of food of the same colour; however, this was only when the food was red, not green. We argue this indicates an unlearned aversion to red food, overcome by social learning of the food being highly palatable. The results provide no evidence that adult hens learn aversions through observing disgust reactions, but show that hens are sensitive to the extent of demonstrator preferences for palatable food. The data do not support the hypothesis that avian social learning is fundamentally different from that of mammals. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the extreme {{thinness}} of the avian pulmonary blood-gas barrier (PBGB), it is remarkably strong. To understand {{the basis of the}} remarkable strength of the avian PBGB, network of collagen connective tissue that form the lung’s parabronchial fibrous framework and type-IV collagen, a principal component of the basement membrane was investigated in the BGB and in the epithelial-epithelial contacts between the air capillaries in the domestic fowl, <b>Gallus</b> <b>gallus</b> variant <b>domesticus.</b> Techniques of discriminatory staining, selective alkali digestion, vascular casting followed by alkali digestion and immunoelectron microscopy were used. Abundant collagen fibers of the interparabronchial septa, which form part of the tunica adventitia of the interparbronchial vessels, firmly interconnect adjacent parabronchi directly and indirectly (via intraparabronchial vessels). Peripherally, the intraparabronchial artery, with its tunic of collagen fibers, enters and penetrates the exchange tissue mantle. The collagen fibers around the vessel decrease in quantity as it divides into blood capillaries. From the luminal side, the projection of the parabronchial lumen into the exchange tissue mantle as the atria, the infundibulae and the air capillaries, in this order, carry collagen covering which reduces in quantity with each division. The three-dimensional interactions between blood capillaries from the peripheral part and air capillaries from the central lumen allow contact formation between blood capillaries, air capillaries and between air- and blood capillaries. Collagen fiber continuum starting from the interparabronchial septa runs through the exchange tissue by following the three contacts sites and terminates at the parabronchial lumen. At the periphery, the collagen fibers constitute a conspicuous bundle. Within the exchange tissue mantle, the collagen forms diffuse complex interconnections of thin fibers. Towards the parabronchial lumen and within interatrial septa, the thinner collagen fibers of the exchange tissue mantle aggregate to form thick bundles which bind to the connective tissues surrounding the parabronchial muscles. Based on the structural arrangements and function of the smooth muscle, the collagen- and the elastic tissue fibers, and structures like the interparabronchial septa and their associated blood vessels, it was envisaged that: dynamic- tension and compressive forces exist in a parabronchus to form a tensegrity (tension integrity) system. The tensegrity arrangement imparts rigidity to a parabronchus while strengthening the air and the blood capillaries. Mechanical interdependence between parabronchi and between air- and blood capillaries allows efficient transmission and redistribution of tension. The tortuous course of the collagen fiber continuum that follows the three-dimensional intertwining of the gas exchange units- from septa to the lumen- ensures that tension does not travel a straight course and as such, any extrinsic or intrinsic force applied to the structure is transmitted away from the point of origin. Graded exercise intensities and perfusion at different pressures on the integrity of the BGB were used to determine the condition under which the blood-gas barrier in the avian lungs fails. Number of red blood cells and protein concentration in the harvested lung lavage fluid were estimated in the exercised chickens. For histological analysis, numbers of epithelial-epithelial (E-E) breaks and blood-gas barrier (BGB) breaks were counted {{in each of the four}} vascular regions of the lung in both the exercised and the perfused lungs. Post exercise blood lactate analysis showed a 4 -fold increase between rest and maximal exercise (2. 95 m/s) while the numbers of red blood cells and protein concentration increased steadily with increasing exercise intensity, however, the degree of increments appeared to decrease at higher workloads. The two kinds of breaks occurred at all levels of exercise and in the resting birds but at any exercise intensity, there were more E-E breaks than BGB breaks. The numbers of breaks increased with increasing exercise intensity and the difference between the two types of breaks decreased with increasing exercise intensity. In resting birds, there were no breaks in the area of the lung supplied by the cranial branch of the PA. In the exercised birds, differences in number of blood-gas barrier breaks among the four vascular territories only occurred at 0. 66 m/s where the lowest and highest counts occurred in the cranial- and caudomedial regions respectively, whereas at all other levels of exercise, the numbers of breaks were comparable. Presence of red blood cells in the lungs of resting birds indicated that failure of the blood-gas barrier might be a common but inconsequential event in the avian lung. A positive linear relationship exists between the perfusion pressure and the numbers of both E-E and blood-gas barrier breaks. At all perfusion pressures, there are more E-E breaks than BGB breaks. The difference between the two types of breaks decreased with increasing pressure. At any perfusion pressure, more breaks occurred in the regions supplied by the accessory- and caudomedial branches of the PA than in the regions supplied by the cranial- and the caudomedial ones. This could be because the pressures in the two blood vessels may be higher since the caudomedial branch is the most direct continuation of the PA while the accessory branch is the narrowest and the first to originate from the PA. Because of the extreme thinness of the blood-gas barrier and unavoidable puncturing of air sac when the thorax is accessed to cannulate the pulmonary vessels, the exact pressure at which the BGB fails could not be ascertained since both types of failure occurred at all perfusion pressures. However, separation of the epithelial-epithelial contacts, caused by distension of the blood capillaries, started appearing at the perfusion pressure of 2. 89 kPa. This may represent the pressure at which the blood-gas barrier starts to fail...|$|R
