For a time he {{considered}} {{the possibility of a}} singing career, and was instructed by a vocal coach from the Metropolitan Opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> them. The family later moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, residing on Kennedy Boulevard and 57th Street. Because North Bergen did not have a high school, he attended Union Hill High School in Union Hill, New Jersey, from which he graduated in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E

Cutolo went close to her and said: [...] "Get up! We don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> your funeral." [...] She then got up. According to Adriano Baglivo of the Corriere della Sera, the old lady came back to consciousness due to the emergency care of a physician familiar with her history of catatonic attacks. However, for Cutolo this episode assumed the character of a miracle and sign of his inner powers.|$|E

He has since become an enthusiastic environmentalist and conservationist, going so far as to create out of whole cloth laws prohibiting the harming of tarsiers. The Philippine Tarsier Foundation Incorporated heard about his enthusiasm and recruited him as field supervisor of the sanctuary. [...] "I love this job because it's actually a dream come true," [...] Pizarras said, beaming.

2500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, {{millinery}} {{was considered a}} respectable trade for middle class women and impoverished upper class women - women who {{would not want to}} lower themselves by becoming domestic servants or performing actual labor. [...] Far from putting their daughters in trade because they were unmarriable, Amy Erickson suggests that parents apprenticed their daughters in order to provide them with a reasonable living when the family did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> a dowry and also to gain skills that might attract a husband and sustain them throughout their lives. Mary and Ann Hogarth, sisters of the artist William Hogarth, contemporaries of Mosley, never married and supported themselves through their own millinery shop. One of their business cards was designed by their brother. To be a successful milliner required [...] not just being a skilled crafts-person, but a sense of style and a head for business. [...] Eleanor Mosley's own life and career serve as a case in point as to the respectability of the trade. [...] She came from a respectable middling class family, served her apprenticeship, and became a member of a trade guild in her own right. Her business was located in a high-end area of London, which she successfully ran for at least fifteen years. [...] Other well-to-do tradesmen paid high premiums to apprentice their daughters to her.|$|E
