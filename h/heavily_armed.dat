5|$|Deceptive {{measures}} {{other than}} dazzle included the fitting of anti-rangefinder baffles to the masts and yards of battleships such as HMS Emperor of India in 1917. Deceptive mimicry was also practised, with <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, Ricasoli {{was armed}} with eighty cannons, {{including}} forty-one 24-pounders, {{making it the}} most <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> fort in Malta. Parts of the fort's enceinte were rebuilt {{under the direction of}} Antoine Étienne de Tousard in the 1790s.|$|E
50|$|Another key tactic in OverPower is {{the idea}} of placing and conceding: the idea is to take some time to <b>heavily</b> <b>arm</b> your team. Your {{opponent}} may gain a mission or two but you may get a significant advantage in the battles that follow. However, placing also reveals more information to your opponent about the cards you have available to use for the round.|$|R

5|$|The Polkarpov TIS was a <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> Soviet heavy fighter {{designed}} {{during the}} early 1940s. Competing contemporaneous designs in the USSR included the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich DIS and Tairov Ta-3.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} {{of the s}} {{underwent a}} massive development since the first Iowa-class ship was laid down in June 1940. Owing to the continual development of the weaponry aboard these battleships they remain the most <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> gunships the United States has ever put to sea.|$|E

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more <b>heavily</b> <b>armed,</b> and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> vehicles at {{the front and back}} of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at the front and rear of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5000|$|The Heavy Tank T101 was an American heavy tank project {{starting}} in April 1957 {{to counter the}} threat of new Soviet armored vehicles. The M46 Patton was not considered <b>heavily</b> enough <b>armed</b> or armored to counter the T-54/55. Though the T101 never saw service ...|$|R

The M46 Patton was not considered <b>heavily</b> enough <b>armed</b> or armored to counter the T-54/55. Thought the T99 never saw service, it did provide post-war engineers with opportunities for testing new engineering methods.|$|R
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would be more difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1945, Lützow joined Galland's Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) at Munich-Riem. JV44 was {{equipped}} with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, an aircraft which was <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> and faster than any Allied fighter. Galland hoped that the Me262 would compensate for the numerical superiority of the Allies. Lützow had been released from his position as fighter leader in Italy and Galland appointed him as his adjutant. Lützow was credited with two aerial victories flying the Me262.|$|E
5|$|Low, Harris {{and their}} ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they {{suffered}} a resounding defeat {{in a battle}} with , a <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched {{under the command of}} Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.|$|E
5000|$|Metal: They {{represent}} human empire {{always ready}} to conquer, {{with the help of}} their advanced weapons and chariots. Humans, Iron, Soldiers, and altered beasts are the recurring theme of Metal. They are the only faction to have high level items that can ridiculously strengthen even the weakest units. Metal spells <b>heavily</b> favor <b>Armed</b> units and Item-equipped units. They are the color of silver.|$|R
5000|$|After some {{experimentation}} with wildcat loads like the [...]40 GA and [...] "centimeter" [...] cartridge, they worked with ammunition manufacturer Norma to standardize the cartridge and design the pistol to fire it. The pistol, meanwhile, {{was adapted from}} the CZ-75 but heavily modified, including a stainless steel frame, easily visible sights, and various other features that would normally only be found on <b>heavily</b> customized <b>arms.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Battle of North Walsham was {{a medieval}} battle fought on 25 or 26 June 1381, {{near the town}} of North Walsham in the English county of Norfolk, in which a large group of rebellious local peasants was confronted by the <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> forces of Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich. The battle is {{significant}} for being the last occurrence of any major resistance during the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} {{the portal}} {{until they could}} transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The raiding party brought back samples of good food and fine worksmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the Humans had not discovered.|$|E
5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more <b>heavily</b> <b>armed,</b> additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
60|$|Leaning <b>heavily</b> {{upon the}} <b>arm</b> {{of one of}} the lacqueys, the Chevalier moved painfully towards the courtyard, where the {{carriage}} was being prepared for him. At the last moment he turned and beckoned the Vicomte to his side.|$|R

5|$|With the {{successful}} {{development of the}} Eighth Army Ranger Company, the establishment of additional Ranger companies was ordered. The composition of the new 2nd Army Ranger Infantry Company was formulated on the Table of Organization and Equipment documents of the World War II Ranger units. The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was organized into three <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> platoons, which were overseen by a headquarters element of five men. Each platoon comprised 36 men in three squads: two assault squads and one heavy weapons squad. Each platoon was also furnished with 60mm M2 mortars, M20 Super Bazookas, and M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles. One sniper was designated for each platoon, with {{the remainder of the}} troops being equipped with M1 Garand and M2 Carbine rifles. They were authorized two vehicles: an M38 Jeep and an M35 2½ ton cargo truck. Overall, the company was far more <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> than both the Eighth Army Ranger Company and standard infantry companies. Like the other numbered Ranger companies, its organization called for 5 officers and 107 enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane. He sailed for France {{with his}} 10-year-old son John Quincy aboard the frigate Boston early that year. The stormy trip was treacherous, with lightning injuring 19 sailors and killing one. Adams' ship was later pursued by several British frigates in the mid-Atlantic, but evaded them. Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> British merchantman ship, the Martha. Later, a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foremost}} Turkish troops crossed the fortifications {{and dealt with}} the Bulgarian defenders, they began plundering the vicinity. However, {{to the surprise of}} Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey, the majority of Momchil's men were {{standing in front of the}} city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes. As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by <b>heavily</b> <b>armed</b> horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot and for the most part did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E

50|$|After the {{war ended}} there was a massive {{economic}} slump. The Scottish economy had been <b>heavily</b> war-orientated: <b>arms</b> production, together with coal and steel for the building of battleships on the River Clyde were no longer needed and such skills were not easily transferred. The Great Depression followed and Margaret found herself amongst the unemployed. In 1918 the Waverley Cabinet Works closed down and she eventually found work {{in one of the}} biscuit factories run by McVitie.|$|R
25|$|In March 1524, Gil González Dávila {{became the}} first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador. {{followed}} by Hernán Cortés, had brought forces down from Mexico. Much of the conquest {{took place in the}} following two decades, first by groups loyal to Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal of Francisco Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado. In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied <b>heavily</b> on <b>armed</b> forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.|$|R
