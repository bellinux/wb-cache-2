5|$|On {{the journey}} to India, the family stopped at Madeira, St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope. At <b>each</b> <b>place,</b> Lady Dalhousie took time to collect plants and made a {{detailed}} catalogue of them. In 1831 she visited the foothills of Simla, along with Penang, near the Malay Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor of Castile {{had died}} on 28November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other. Moreover, like his father, Edward was very {{devoted to his}} wife and was {{faithful}} to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at <b>each</b> <b>place</b> where her funeral cortège stopped for the night. As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister Margaret, but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|Five {{different}} jerseys {{were worn}} during the 1994 Giro d'Italia. The {{leader of the}} general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses {{for the first three}} finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. The time bonuses for the 1988 Giro were thirty seconds for first, twenty-five for second, and decreasing by five seconds <b>each</b> <b>place</b> until five seconds for sixth place on the stage. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At <b>each</b> <b>place</b> the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E
5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said, for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At <b>each</b> <b>place</b> where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire used impalement during, and before, {{the last}} siege of Constantinople in 1453. For example, during the buildup phase {{to the great}} siege the year before, in 1452, the sultan {{declared}} that all ships sailing up or down through the Bosphorus had to anchor at his fortress there, for inspection. One Venetian captain, Antonio Rizzo, sought to defy the ban, but his ship {{was hit by a}} cannonball. He and his crew were picked up from the waters, the crew members to be beheaded (or sawn asunder according to Niccolò Barbaro), whereas Rizzo was impaled. In {{the early days of the}} siege in May 1453, contingents of the Ottoman army made mop-up operations at minor fortifications like Therapia and Studium. The surrendered soldiers, some 40 individuals from <b>each</b> <b>place,</b> were impaled.|$|E

5|$|The second {{classification}} was points classification. On {{each stage}} of the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 15 points, with 12 for the second-placed rider, 9 for the third-placed rider, 7 for the sixth-placed rider and then one point fewer for <b>each</b> <b>place</b> down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top three riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, and one points for the riders in second and third places respectively. The rider with the most points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. Over the three stages, there were 13 categorised climbs. On each of these climbs, the first four riders to the summit were awarded points, with 5 for the first rider, 3 for the second, 2 for the third and 1 for the fourth. The rider with the most accumulated points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a dark pink jersey.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. On {{each stage of}} the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 12 points, with 10 for the second-placed rider, 8 for the third-placed rider and then one point fewer for <b>each</b> <b>place</b> down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, two and one points for the riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a team time trial. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, points were awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.|$|E

25|$|After the war tourist {{patterns}} changed considerably. Many {{more people}} {{could afford to}} travel abroad for their holidays, and car ownership became commonplace, leading to fewer visitors to British holiday resorts, mostly travelling by car, and often touring, spending {{a day or two}} in <b>each</b> <b>place.</b> Many visitors stay at inexpensive bed & breakfast accommodation (b's) instead of hotels.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy's eight-volume atlas Geographia is a {{prototype}} of modern mapping and GIS. It included an index of place-names, with the latitude and longitude of <b>each</b> <b>place</b> to guide the search, scale, conventional signs with legends, {{and the practice of}} orienting maps so that north is at the top and east {{to the right of the}} map—an almost universal custom today.|$|E

25|$|Isocurvature density perturbations: In <b>each</b> <b>place</b> the sum (over {{different}} types of particle) of the fractional additional densities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% less energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. Cosmic strings would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations.|$|E
25|$|Cases of {{the disease}} were not known to occur {{in what is now}} France (except in the Pale of Calais, which was {{controlled}} by England at the time) or Italy. It also emerged in Flanders and the Netherlands, probably transmitted directly from England by travellers, as it appeared simultaneously in the cities of Antwerp and Amsterdam on the morning of 27 September. In <b>each</b> <b>place</b> it infected, it prevailed for a short time, generally not more than a fortnight.|$|E

25|$|If a Turing {{reduction}} of A to B exists then every algorithm for B {{can be used}} to produce an algorithm for A, by inserting the algorithm for B at <b>each</b> <b>place</b> where the oracle machine computing A queries the oracle for B. However, because the oracle machine may query the oracle a large number of times, the resulting algorithm may require more time asymptotically than either the algorithm for B or the oracle machine computing A, and may require as much space as both together.|$|E
25|$|The stile recitativo, as {{the newly}} created style of monody was called, proved to be popular not only in Florence, but {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Florence and Venice were the two most progressive musical centers in Europe {{at the end of}} the 16th century, and the combination of musical innovations from <b>each</b> <b>place</b> resulted in the development of what came to be known as the Baroque style. Caccini's achievement was to create a type of direct musical expression, as easily understood as speech, which later developed into the operatic recitative, and which influenced numerous other stylistic and textural elements in Baroque music.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} {{techniques of}} how to produce whistle speech, the choice of which is dependent on practical concerns. Bilabial and labiodental techniques are common for short and medium distance discussions (in a market, in the noise of a room, or for hunting); whereas the tongue retroflexed, one or two fingers introduced in the mouth, a blow concentrated at the junction between two fingers or the lower lip pulled while breathing in air are techniques used to reach high levels of power for long distance speaking. <b>Each</b> <b>place</b> has its favorite trend {{that depends on the}} most common use of the village and on the personal preferences of each whistler. Whistling with a leaf or a flute is often related to courtship or poetic expression (reported in the Kickapoo language in Mexico and in the Hmong and Akha cultures in Asia).|$|E
5000|$|Temporary sub-divisions of a fleet. In the Age of Sail, fleets {{were divided}} into van, centre, and rear squadrons, named after <b>each's</b> <b>place</b> {{in the line of}} battle. A {{temporary}} detachment from a fleet would also be called a squadron.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} cuspidal representations in {{spaces of}} automorphic forms for the congruence subgroup Γ_ 0 (I) of Hilbert modular groups for some number field F. To each such representation are associated the eigenvalue λ_j of the Casimir operator at <b>each</b> real <b>place</b> j of F, {{and the number}} _ p parametrizing the eigenvalue of the Hecke operator T_ p^ 2 at <b>each</b> finite <b>place</b> p outside the ideal I. We study the joint distribution of the λ_j for all real places j, and the _ p for finitely many p outside I, over the cuspidal representations. This distribution is given by {{the product of the}} Plancherel measure at <b>each</b> real <b>place</b> and the Sato-Tate measure at <b>each</b> finite <b>place...</b>|$|R
