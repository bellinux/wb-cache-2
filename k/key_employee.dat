Mr Ede contacted Cameron Slater and they then discussed how an Official Information Act request for the information should be worded. Slater emailed the request while they were still talking on the phone and also provided Slater with draft blog posts attacking Mr Goff. Cameron Slater subsequently used the information to attack former Labour leader, Phil Goff, on his blog.|$|E

2500|$|Work at Ball Research brought Widlar {{in contact}} with Jean Hoerni and Sheldon Roberts, the creators of {{radiation}} hardened transistors and co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a <b>key</b> <b>employee</b> of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they are doing is bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's Applications Engineering division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by process engineer David Talbert, reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the question, what factors influence voluntary employee turnover in {{small businesses and}} how do owner-managers retain <b>key</b> <b>employees?</b> More specifically the study explores four research objectives: 1) {{the negative effects of}} voluntary turnover of <b>key</b> <b>employees</b> on small businesses; 2) common reasons why employees voluntarily leave small businesses; 3) characteristics of the small business that might enhance retention of employees; and 4) strategies that are employed to retain <b>key</b> <b>employees.</b> The current study employed an exploratory qualitative research design. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with nine owner-managers and seven <b>key</b> <b>employees</b> from eleven Australian small businesses. A variant of the critical incident technique (CIT) was incorporated into the interviews with owner-managers with the aim of retrieving actual accounts of voluntary employee turnover and retention. The findings revealed that voluntary turnover of <b>key</b> <b>employees</b> have a number of adverse consequences for small businesses, including, but not limited to, lowered productivity and disrupted business continuity. A lack of financial resources to retain staff and limited long term career prospects, amongst other factors, were identified as common reasons for actual and intended turnover amongst <b>key</b> <b>employees.</b> In contrast, flat management structures and egalitarian work environments were some of the small business characteristics claimed to enhance employee retention. Owner-managers reported on a suite of remuneration based (e. g. providing pay rises and paid training) and positive emotion based (e. g. maintaining pleasant group dynamics) retention strategies. Some of the findings in the current study have been widely discussed in the literature whilst others cast light on relatively under-explored causes and consequences of voluntary employee turnover and employee retention strategies. Implications of the findings for management practice are explained. Limitations of the current study and their implications for future research as well as other areas that warrant further research are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|Top {{talent is}} usually quite rare, so {{companies}} often negotiate deals {{in order to}} hold on to <b>key</b> <b>employees.</b> Golden handcuffs constitute one of several ways to stop companies' <b>key</b> <b>employees</b> leaving, making it essentially financially unprofitable for them to walk away from their employers. Such deals are usually done with stock options, phantom stock or deferred payments. Phantom stock usually gives the best results, as it gives an employee of a company using the technique a motive for staying with the company and making it grow, since the stock increases in value alongside the company. To create a contract that benefits both the employee and the company, a legal team should be contacted in order to discuss available options, and <b>key</b> <b>employees</b> should be distinguished from others. A funding mechanism should be put in place by the company (if privately held), where obligations are present. Tax repercussions should be minimised for the money set aside, usually using insurance as main funding mechanism.
