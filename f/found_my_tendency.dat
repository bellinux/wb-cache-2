While writing it, Chopin wrote to Tytus Woyciechowski, saying, “Here you doubtless observe <b>my</b> <b>tendency</b> to do wrong against my will. As something has involuntarily crept into my head through my eyes, I love to indulge it, {{even though it may}} be all wrong.” Undoubtedly, this sight must have been the well-known soprano Konstancja Gładkowska, who was the “ideal” behind the Larghetto from Chopin’s Second Piano Concerto.|$|R
