Not all the singers Manne accompanied were even primarily jazz artists. Performers {{as diverse as}} Teresa Brewer, Leontyne Price, Tom Waits, and Barry Manilow included Manne in their recording sessions.|$|E
25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> in his {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E
25|$|I knew I {{was going}} to cop a lot of stick {{but it will be}} like water off a duck's back...I {{expected}} stick {{at the start of the}} innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series. But I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E

25|$|De Faria says he {{was told}} by his spirit guides that he must expand his work to reach more people and spiritist medium Chico Xavier told him he {{should go to the}} small Goiás town of Abadiânia to fulfill his healing mission. Around 1978, when João first {{performed}} healings there, he <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> outdoors in a chair near the main road where people began to arrive seeking cures for their various illnesses and conditions. Gradually the numbers increased to thousands per day and he developed his centre, Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola. The Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola has since been visited by millions of people seeking healing. He also owns a nearby cattle ranch, which covers about 1,000 acres and is valued over 2 million reais.|$|E

500|$|Sometime in {{the autumn}} of 1983, Stipe and Sweet wrote at least three songs together. Of their songwriting process, Sweet has said: [...] " [...] was the real {{powerhouse}} behind it. I was pretty tentative in those days. We <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> around, Michael went through the little book he wrote lyrics in, with me just kind of strumming along behind." ...|$|E

500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|When Dylan played Shelton the song, {{shortly after}} {{recording}} it, he claimed, [...] "This {{is the best}} song I've ever written." [...] Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, [...] "Just listen to that! That's old-time religious carnival music!" [...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down at a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing... I just started writing and I couldn't stop. After a period of time, I forgot {{what it was all}} about, and I started trying {{to get back to the}} beginning [...]" ...|$|E

Kulwicki's racecar transporter was driven from the rainy track later that Friday morning while other teams and the media watched it travel slowly around the track with a black wreath on its grille. In 2008, Kyle Petty described the slow laps as [...] "the saddest thing I've ever seen at a racetrack... We <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> and cried." [...] Kulwicki had competed in fiveNASCAR races that season with twoTop5 finishes, and was ranked ninth in points at his death. In his career, he had won fiveNASCAR Winston Cup races, 24 pole positions, 75 Top10 finishes, and onechampionship in 207 races.|$|E

500|$|Germain {{left the}} series in 1993, and several new writers {{replaced}} him. At that time, Nickelodeon permitted {{the writers and}} animators to include a storyline {{about the death of}} Chuckie's mother. The development of the Rugrats Mother's Day television special was announced on December 7, 1996. Kim Cattrall provided the voice for Chuckie's mother, Melinda Finster. Germain described the episode as [...] "this whole very maudlin thing," [...] and said that he was disappointed over his inability to cover the topic. He explained: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there thinking, 'We weren't allowed to do this, and now you guys are doing it.' That's something I regret." [...] Mary Harrington, a supervising producer of animation for Nickelodeon, described it as one of her favorite episodes of Rugrats, and commended the writers and producers for their handling of the subject matter.|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E

I think I should <b>just</b> have <b>sat</b> down and cried if they told me Miss Una'd come back to Woodbury, and never so much as asked to see me." ...|$|R
500|$|Their {{chartered}} yacht, the MV Arvi, {{was detained}} in Crete {{because of bad}} weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days. Taylor complained that {{on a trip to}} a small hill village, [...] "We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us", which Mardas had organised. McCartney later said that while sailing around Greek islands, everybody <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> around and took LSD. They eventually found the [...] island of Leslo, which had a small fishing village, four beaches and a large olive grove. Four small neighbouring islands surrounded it (which were planned as one for each Beatle) so the island was bought for £95,000 (with a 25% premium); but it was sold for a modest profit a few months later, after all four Beatles lost interest in the idea.|$|E
500|$|It has {{a length}} of over 114minutes and {{contains}} five subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German. Extra features added to the release included another a cappella version of [...] "Born This Way" [...] which was performed on stage unlike {{the one in the}} closing credits. A photo gallery was also included as well as backstage footage showing Gaga meeting with actress Liza Minnelli. According to Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com, the audio tracks were commendable for their crisp sound. He stated that [...] "One of the best things about this concert is despite its artifice, even its artificiality, there's absolutely no question that Lady Gaga is actually singing. What a novel idea for a live concert, and one that seemed especially refreshing after having <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> through the [...] concert Blu-ray, where Brit's live voice was all but buried in the pre-records." ...|$|E
500|$|Slipknot {{recorded}} Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses with producer Rick Rubin at The Mansion in Los Angeles, California in 2003. Earlier {{there had}} been speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} third album and the band's future, as some members worked on other musical projects. After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together and working out their differences hindered the writing process initially. During an interview in 2008, drummer Joey Jordison said [...] "we didn't talk to each other for three months, we <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there wasting money in the fucking Houdini mansion." [...] Speaking retrospectively percussionist Shawn Crahan states; [...] "eventually we got sick of waiting for shit to happen. We got together, had a few beers and wrote a really artsy, fucked up song called 'Happy Ending'." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have we done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
