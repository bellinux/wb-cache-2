With regard to Figure 6, and the equation for <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> (H), H = R × sin(90 – θ). Sahni and Bhatia [1] have misread the methodology text, as R refers to the radius of the aortic curva-ture of the ascending aorta, not the radius of the aorta. The radius of the aorta {{does not affect the}} <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> of the ejected blood. The demonstration that the site of impact is non-physiological in some instances indicates that the direct jet impact may not always be the initiating pathological event for the aortic dissection.

40|$|International audienceThe use {{of dynamic}} {{computational}} methods has become indispensable {{for the assessment}} of rockfall hazards and the quantification of uncertainties. Although a substantial number of models with various degrees of complexity has become available over the past few years, models have only rarely been parameterized against observations, especially because long-term records of rockfalls have proven to be scarce and typically incomplete. On forested slopes, tree-ring analyses may help to fill this gap, as they have been shown to provide annually resolved data on past rockfall activity over long periods. In this paper, a total of 1495 rockfall scars recorded on the stem surface of 1004 trees have been studied at a site in the Vercors massif (French Alps) to calibrate the 3 D process based simulation model RockyFor 3 D. Uncertainties related to the choice of parameters accounting for energy dissipation and surface roughness have been investigated in detail. Because of the lack of reliable data, these parameters typically are estimated based on expert judgments, {{despite the fact that they}} have significant impacts on runout distances and bounce height. We demonstrate that slight variations in roughness can indeed strongly affect the performance of runout modeling and that the decreasing downward gradient, observed in field data, is properly reproduced only if reduced roughness (< 10 cm) enables blocks to reach the distal parts of the study plot. With respect to the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>impacts,</b> our results also reveal that differences between simulations and observations can indeed be minimized if softer soil types are preferred during simulation, as they typically limit bouncing.

An important role on the final performance is surely linked to the knee joint motion, although only few studies addressed lower-limb influence. In this work we propose a study about the proprioceptive angle size of knee joint in the first flat serve produced by tennis players of different performance levels. Twelve subjects involved in the study are divided in three groups using the ITN classification code: beginner, intermediate and advanced players. A simple biomechanical model of lower limb was proposed to study the knee joint motion. Three flat serves were recorded using three synchronized cams. A specific algorithm was developed to obtain the maximum flexion value of front knee using coordinates of lower-limb joints.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} has been developed that can analyze signals from piezoelectric sensors to detect the location and intensity of low-energy impact on a composite panel. The panel has two piezopolymer sensors attached some distance apart from each other. The signals are analyzed by the {{artificial neural network}} using a binary pattern associator. The binary pattern associator facilitates memory build-up during learn-ing while simplifying signal discrimination during testing. The impact monitoring system, which consists of the artificial neural network and the piezoelectric sensors, has been used successfully to detect the location and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> when a small steel ball is dropped onto a composite laminate., BACKGROUND NE OF THE main shortcomings of composite laminates is their vulnerabilityOto low-energy impact. The damage induced by such impact may not be visi-ble on the outside surfaces but can be substantial internally. Although, in princi-ple, an ultrasonic scanning such as C-scan {{can be used to}} detect the invisible in-ternal damage, its implementation in the field is not practical because the entire structure has to be inspected before the damage can be located. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an impact monitoring system that can monitor in-service impact events [1, 2].

Obviously, some steps of the wall lifecycle have a small environmental footprint: the consumer use step provides little impacts, while {{the end of life}} step (post-consumer) allows a saving (diminution?) <b>of</b> <b>impacts</b> because <b>of</b> the “reusing ” of (possibility to reuse) a part of the natural materials.

40|$|Rotary mills {{are used}} {{extensively}} {{to reduce the}} coarse rocks of mined ores down to a product fine enough to facilitate the extraction of the valuable minerals. On the South African gold mines alone about 110 million tons of ore is mined annually, at a power cost of about R 90 million, and a liner material cost of about R 30 million. The charge motion in mills has been studied both theoretically and experimentally {{since the beginning of}} the century. However, a lot of the work has been purely empirical, and some of it illconceived, resulting in there still being a poor understanding of the topic. The influence of lifter-bars upon charge motion has only been considered in the past few decades, and mostly to a very limited extent. This state of affairs has left the field wide open to further research. The charge motion of an isolated rod or ball, and how it is influenced by a flat-faced lifter-bar of any face-angle and <b>of</b> any <b>height,</b> was modelled theoretically. The charge motion of rods in a glass-ended mill was filmed with a high-speed camera. The mill was fitted with a variety of lifter-bars with different face-angles and heights, and was run at a wide range of speeds. The filmed trajectories of the rods were then tracked. The coefficients of friction between the rods and lifter-bar material were measured under vibrating conditions as are found in the mill. The power draw of the mill was also measured at a wide range of mill speeds, and with lifter-bars <b>of</b> different <b>heights</b> in the mill. A good correlation between the theoretical predictions and experimental results was found over a wide range <b>of</b> conditions. The <b>impact</b> point, at which the grinding element strikes the mill shell, was considered to be of primary importance in the analysis. It was found that the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the lifter-bar has a strong influence on charge trajectories, as the height increases from zero up to just greater than one charge radius. Thereafter the lift increases until a critical lifter-bar height is reached, beyond which the grinding element is projected off the lifter prior to reaching the tip, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> point increasing slightly and then decreasing to a constant height. However, the change in the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> point is very small, so in practical terms an increase in lifter-bar height, once it is higher than the radius of the grinding element, has a very small effect upon the charge trajectories. An increase in the angle of the lifter-bars was found to have a strong influence upon the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the charge trajectories. A linear relationship between the mill speed and the impact angle was dicovered, and changes in the mill speed strongly influence the charge trajectories. It was also found that the power draw of a mill depends on the liner configuration, with power draw decreasing as the lifter-bar height is increased. Some new and surprising effects of lifter-bar geometry upon the charge trajectories, which are of great practical importance, have been discovered. The theoretical model is an advance upon all previous models, and agrees well with experimental results over a wide range of conditions...|$|R

The droplet contact angle was analyzed by the Goniometry method. The water was dropped on the calcium fluoride and the copper foil using a syringe (sharp tip) with initial droplet diameter of 1. 9 mm.

40|$|Studies {{focusing}} on moraine deposits which slide into glacial lakes are scarce, {{even though they}} can trigger impact waves responsible for generating glacial lake outburst floods. We focused on landslides in lateral moraines as possible triggers. Detailed geomorphological, geophysical, and satellite radar interferometric investigations of the Palcacocha Lake moraine (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) together with laboratory tests on samples from the site provided data for slope stability calculations using GeoSlope software and hydrodynamic impact wave modeling using the Iber code. We identified landslides that could affect Palcacocha Lake and calculated their stability (factor of safety) under specified conditions, including variable water saturation and earthquake effects. Calculations showed that the moraine slopes {{are close to the}} threshold value (Fs = 1) for stability and are especially sensitive to water saturation. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> waves triggered by a landslide in 2003 and the potential wave heights from newly identified, possibly active landslides were calculated, based on landslide volume estimates, detailed lake bathymetry, and basin topography. Results show that potential future landslide-triggered waves could have similar properties to the 2003 impact wave. Evidence gathered in this study suggests that glacial lake outburst floods triggered by landslides from moraines, however, would be probably smaller than floods resulting from other types of slope processes (e. g., ice/rock avalanches) if dam breach is not taken into account. This assumption has to be critically evaluated against site-specific conditions at a given lake and any possible environmental factors, such as climate change or earthquake that may mobilize larger volumes of moraine material...|$|E
40|$|Pedestrian {{safety is}} a serious global problem {{that needs to be}} {{addressed}} by drivers, vehicle manufacturers and researchers. Since the first European Committee directive for pedestrian safety was published, vehicle suppliers have implemented pedestrian protection requirements to automobile structures at the design level. As to the development of current automobile front-end structures, a question arises about pedestrian safety: are there existing injury criteria for the new generation of cars? Most previous injury thresholds for knee ligaments were principally based on isolated sub-segment tests with contrived loading conditions, and rarely took the entire front-end shape of the car model into account to simulate realistic pedestrian loading conditions. Hence, the current study aims to investigate injury thresholds of primary knee ligament injuries in car–pedestrian impact environments as well as to evaluate the previous criteria proposed by isolated sub-segment tests. The entire front-end shape of a car model was employed. A parametric study of various pedestrian loading conditions was implemented by finite element simulations regarding three influencing factors: <b>impact</b> <b>heights,</b> locations <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> and impact velocities. Finally, the injury thresholds associated with primary knee ligament injuries of pedestrians were defined with the dominant injury mechanisms: combined lateral bending and shearing effects.

40|$|Road safety {{barriers}} {{are used to}} redirect traffic at roadside work-zones. When filled with water, these barriers are able to withstand low to moderate impact speeds up to 50 kmh- 1. Despite this feature, Portable Water-filled barriers (PWFB) face challenges such as large lateral displacements, tearing and breakage during impact; especially at higher speeds. This study explores the use of composite action to enhance the crashworthiness of PWFBs and enable their usage at higher speeds. Initially, energy absorption capability of water in PWFB is investigated. Then, composite action of the PWFB {{with the introduction of}} steel frame is considered to evaluate its enhanced <b>impact</b> performance. Findings <b>of</b> the study show that the initial <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> must be lower than the free surface level of water in a PWFB in order for the water to provide significant crash energy absorption. In general, an <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> a road barrier with 80 % filled is a good estimation. Furthermore, the addition of a composite structure greatly reduces the probability of tearing by decreasing the strain and impact energy transferred to the shell container. This allows the water to remain longer in the barrier to absorb energy via inertial displacements and sloshing response. Information from this research will aid in the design of new generation roadside safety structures aimed to increase safety in modern roadways...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the temporal behavior <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> features on Jupiter created by the fragments of the Shoemaker Levy- 9 comet that collided with the planet in July 1994. The primary observations used in the study were ground based images of Jupiter acquired from the Swedish Solar Vacuum Tube on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. The measurement of position <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> features in images acquired immediately after the impact over a period of a few days revealed that the apparent drift rates were too high and that a repetitive pattern could be seen in the longitude position on successive rotations. This could be explained only {{by the fact that the}} measured longitudes <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> sites were being affected by parallax due to a significant elevation <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> debris above the nominal cloud top altitude value used for image navigation. Once the apparent positions are analyzed as a function of the meridian angle, the parallax equation can be used to infer the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> features above the cloud deck, once the true impact position (longitude) for the feature is known. Due to their inherent high spatial resolution, the HST measurements <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> site locations have been accepted widely. However, these suffer from the parallax themselves since few of them were obtained at central meridian. Ground based imaging have the potential to improve this knowledge as they do observe most <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> sites on either side of the central meridian, except for the degraded resolution. Measurements over a large number of images enables us to minimize the position error through regression and thus estimate both the actual impact site location devoid of parallax bias, and also of the altitude level <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> debris above the cloud deck. With rapid imaging there is the potential to examine the time evolution of the altitude level.

Because the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the subject is calculated by averaging the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> each frame, and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> each frame {{is affected by the}} posture. In the case of TR is low, the calculated height is heavily affected by the postures of the sampled frames, and this can lead to accuracy degradation. As for view quality, the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> view difference is not so large, because essentially, height is view-invariant feature.|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{research}} on grounded cognition and metaphorical representation, the authors propose and confirm in five studies that physical height {{or even the}} mere concept <b>of</b> <b>height</b> can <b>impact</b> the perceptual and conceptual levels of mental construal. As such, consumers perceiving themselves to be physically elevated or “high ” {{are more likely to}} adopt a global perceptual processing and higher level of conceptual construal, while those perceiving themselves to be physically “low ” are more likely to adopt a local perceptual processing and lower level of conceptual construal. This difference in level <b>of</b> construal also <b>impacts</b> product choices involving trade-offs between long-term benefit and short-term effort. Alternative accounts such as vertical distance, visual distance, and perceived power are addressed. By highlighting the novel relationship between height and construal level, these findings contribute to research on grounded cognition and construal-level theory, while also providing practical suggestions to marketing managers across a variety of domains. Key words: height, construal level, global and local perceptual processing, grounded cognition, consumer preference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{mechanical}} properties of Al functionally graded materials (FGMs) crash box fabricated by heat treatment is predicted based on temperature distribution and experimental data. The Al FGM crash box is fabricated by applying different temperature at the {{both ends of}} a square hollow Al column for 4 hours. Due to the gradient in heat treatment temperature along the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the Al column, the microstructure is locally varied so that a certain variation of local material properties is achieved. The determination of material properties at any point along the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> Al FGM crash box experimentally is uneasy. The Lagrange interpolation method is proposed to predict the variation of local material properties at any point along the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> Al FGM crash box for further work such as simulation <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> on the crash box. The determination of {{mechanical properties}} is successfully predicted using the available experimental data and the temperature distribution obtained in simulation...|$|R
30|$|To {{examine this}} {{possibility}} I separated the 2006 – 10 DNB sample into half sub-samples of workers age 25 – 42 and ages 43 – 59 and re-estimated the equation for which results were {{shown in the}} last column of Table[*] 5. Of course, {{the men in the}} sub-sample of older workers are shorter than those in the younger sub-sample (181.05 cm vs. 184.28 cm), and, indeed, the variance is higher in the younger sub-sample. The crucial thing to note is that the parameter estimate <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>height</b> on log-earnings in the older sub-sample is 0.0049, nearly identical to the estimates shown in Table[*] 5 for the mid- 1990 s for all men ages 25 – 598. Among workers in the younger sub-sample the estimated <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>height</b> on log-earnings is − 0.0039 in 2006 – 10. Apparently the market only rewarded the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> older workers, those whose distribution <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> matched more closely that {{of the people who were}} likely to have been their employers than did the right-shifted distribution <b>of</b> the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> younger workers.|$|R
2500|$|The Hadean {{environment}} {{would have}} been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to [...] in diameter, {{would have been}} sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the ocean {{within a few months}} <b>of</b> <b>impact,</b> with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude.
