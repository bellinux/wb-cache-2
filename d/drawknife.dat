25|$|Fifty million tent pegs were {{manufactured}} in the United Kingdom throughout World War II via the <b>drawknife</b> method, with as few as 18 draws completing a piece from tree cut log to peg.|$|E
25|$|The <b>drawknife</b> ideally is {{used when}} the {{operator}} is in a seated position astride a traditional shaving horse, which safely grips the working stock, {{and they can}} also use their legs for additional pulling power.|$|E
25|$|Large drawknives {{can be used}} {{to dress}} logs, and small sizes for carving and shaving. A common use of a <b>drawknife</b> is to create a roughly {{cylindrical}} billet of wood for turning on a pole lathe.|$|E
5000|$|Scandinavian Full-Scribe (also {{known as}} the [...] "chinkless method") is naturally-shaped, smoothly-peeled (<b>drawknifed)</b> logs which are scribed and custom-fitted to one another. They are notched where they overlap at the corners, {{and there are several}} ways to notch the logs.|$|R
50|$|Grew & Neergaard summise that {{a similar}} method was used in medieval times, in part from an {{illustration}} in the Mendel Housebook. A workman is shown using a small hand adze for finishing pattens with <b>drawknives</b> (or possibly stock knives) {{hanging on the wall}} behind.|$|R
50|$|Analysis {{of timber}} samples from Viking long boats {{shows that a}} variety of timbers were used, but there was strong {{preference}} for oak, a tree associated with Thor in Viking mythology. Oak is a heavy, durable timber that can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (wet/unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Other timber used were ash, elm, pine, spruce and larch. Spruce is light and seems to have been more common in later designs for internal hull battens (stringers). Although it is used for spars in modern times there is as yet no evidence the Vikings used spruce for masts. All timber was used unseasoned. The bark was removed by a bark spade. This consisted of a 1.2 m wooden handle with a T crossbar at the upper end, fitted with a broad chisel-like cutting edge of iron. The cutting edge was 60 mm wide and 80 mm long with a 120 mm neck where the handle was inserted. It appears that in cold winters wood work stopped and partly completed timber work was buried in mud to prevent it drying out. Timber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a side axe. Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, <b>drawknives,</b> planes and saws. Iron saws were probably very rare. The Domesday Book in England (1086 AD) records only 13 saws. Possibly these were pit saws and it is uncertain if they were used in longship construction.|$|R
25|$|A <b>drawknife</b> is {{commonly}} used to remove large slices of wood for flat faceted work, to debark trees, or to create roughly rounded or cylindrical billets for further work on a lathe, or it can shave like a spokeshave plane, where finer finishing is less of concern than a rapid result. The thin blade lends itself to create complex concave or convex curves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideal working}} stock has {{the grain of}} the wood running {{parallel}} to the shaving horse, and perpendicular to the blade of the <b>drawknife,</b> so that the <b>drawknife</b> shaves away the entire wood fibre and does not cut against it. [...] It is best not pulled with blade perfectly perpendicular to the wood stock, but pulled slightly upward toward them in a skewed (blade at a slight diagonal) or slithering fashion, aiming not to take off as much wood as possible, but gradually [...] "shave" [...] the work. The operator gently levers the blade to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood and then controls the depth of the cut by raising or lowering the handles as they pull the <b>drawknife</b> towards them.|$|E
2500|$|For {{very rapid}} and rough removal of stock, the blade is drawn toward the user and rapidly levered {{into the wood}} to make as deep a cut as possible. The {{operator}} immediately stops pulling, and uses the <b>drawknife</b> blade to lever upward so as to [...] "flick" [...] the splinter or splice out of the worked piece. This technique is advanced and may damage the worked piece and <b>drawknife</b> blade if due care is not observed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{operated}} conventionally, that is blade bevel-side upward the <b>drawknife</b> takes deeper {{cuts and}} some novices {{may find it}} {{has a tendency to}} [...] "dive" [...] (cut unintentionally deep).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>drawknife</b> in the {{illustration}} has a blade [...] although much shorter drawknives are also made. The blade is sharpened to a chisel bevel. Traditionally, it is a rounded, smooth bevel. The handles can be {{below the level}} of the blade (as in {{the illustration}}) or at the same level.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>drawknife</b> (drawing knife, draw shave, shaving knife) is a {{traditional}} woodworking hand tool used to shape wood by removing shavings. It consists of a blade with a handle at each end. The blade is much longer (along the cutting edge) than it is deep (from cutting edge to back edge). It is pulled or [...] "drawn" [...] (hence the name) toward the user.|$|E
2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a <b>drawknife,</b> so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the bandsaw, I use a Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool does about the same job as a spokeshave -- it can take {{off a lot of}} wood very quickly -- but I can use it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E
50|$|Shaving {{green wood}} with the <b>drawknife</b> or {{spokeshave}} {{along the grain}} is far quicker and easier work than turning across it. Skilled operators can produce very fine results with a <b>drawknife</b> and shavehorse, requiring minimal lathe finishing.|$|E

5000|$|A Sussex trug is {{a wooden}} basket mainly used for gardening. It {{is made from}} a handle and rim of coppiced sweet {{chestnut}} wood which is hand-cleft then shaved using a <b>drawknife.</b> The body of the trug is made of five or seven thin boards of cricket bat willow, also hand-shaved with a <b>drawknife.</b> [...] They were probably originated in Sussex because of the abundance of chestnut coppice and willows found on the marshes. Nails or pins used are usually copper, to avoid rust.|$|E

50|$|Spokeshaves can be {{made from}} flat-bottom, concave, or convex soles, {{depending}} on the type of job to be performed. Spokeshaves can include one or more sharpened notches along which the wooden shaft is pulled in order to shave it down to the proper diameter. Historically, spokeshave blades were made of metal, whilst the body and handles were wood. An early design consisted of a metal blade with a pair of tangs to which the wooden handles were attached, as with a <b>drawknife.</b> Unlike a <b>drawknife,</b> but like a plane, spokeshaves typically have a sole plate that fixes the angle of the blade relative to the surface being worked. By the twentieth century metal handles and detachable blades had become the most common.|$|E

50|$|Shingles {{are less}} durable than shakes, {{particularly}} in wet climates; shakes are {{finished with a}} <b>drawknife</b> or similar tool which leaves a smooth surface that resists water penetration, and this in turn slows the softening of wood by microorganisms. Also, the method of splitting shakes rather than sawing ensures only straight-grained pieces (which are much stronger {{and less likely to}} warp).|$|E
5000|$|Rasps come in {{a variety}} of shapes - rectangular, round, and {{half-round}} - and vary in coarseness from finest, [...] "cabinet", to most aggressive, [...] "wood". They are used in woodworking for rapidly removing material, and are easier to control than a <b>drawknife.</b> The rough surfaces they leave may be smoothed with finer tools, such as single or double-cut files.|$|E

50|$|Shingle Mill- Before the Shingle Mill, early {{settlers}} had to {{make their}} own shingles by splitting cedar with a froe (a tool with a long iron blade that was struck with a heavy mallet) and then shaved to the proper thickness with a <b>drawknife.</b> With the Shingle Mill, hundreds of shingles could be produced in an hour. The cedar shingles on some of the building in the Village were made by this mill.|$|E
5000|$|McCaleb {{works out}} of a {{farmhouse}} in New Hampshire using a band saw, two-handled <b>drawknife,</b> and two-handled spokeshave to shape the fish, before filing, sanding and rasping them. A five layer paint takes six weeks, {{and there is a}} 12-month order backlog for the sculptures that start at $110 per inch and were described in Forbes as being so beautiful [...] "that your descendants will be gaffing one another to inherit them." ...|$|E
50|$|Hitting {{the narrow}} blade of a froe {{constantly}} soon damages a mallet, {{and so the}} traditional implement used to hit it is a froe club. This is simply a short length of a thin log, still with the bark on it, with one end reduced with a <b>drawknife</b> to convenient diameter for a handle. It is rotated slightly in the hand with each blow, so as to even the wear, and although it soon wears out, a new one can easily be made.|$|E
50|$|Clissett made {{chairs in}} the West Midlands tradition, turning the parts from fresh, unseasoned ash (Fraxinus excelsior) with a pole lathe. Other parts were sawn and shaped with a <b>drawknife</b> while held in a shave horse. Seats were {{generally}} made from an elm board, or from woven rush. While rush-seated ladderback chairs are his most well-known output, he also made spindleback chairs which are often stamped with his initials. Clissett {{is often referred to}} as a bodger but this is incorrect as he made entire chairs rather than just turned parts.|$|E
50|$|Production of {{the several}} {{different}} parts of the chair required a different set of tools than other chairs popular during the 18th century in colonial America like the Windsor chair and formal sidechairs. Creating the cylindrical pieces of a ladder-back chair, such as the legs, occasionally the uprights, or the spindles, were most easily created using a turner's chisels and gouges as the wood spun on a lathe. Meanwhile, the slats along {{the back of the chair}} required several different sizes of saws and a plane. The ladderback chair's seat was formed using a <b>drawknife</b> when the seat was made of wood, otherwise, it was woven using cane or rush.|$|E
50|$|The {{more common}} use, however, {{is in the}} {{production}} of specialty timber products not readily available through lumber yards. The most common ways they are used to generate an income are - sawing lumber for customers as a mobile service, cutting and selling lumber locally, and cutting lumber that is directly used to create a final product. Portable mills are particularly effective for truing up logs for use in log building, replacing the traditional use of a <b>drawknife,</b> which is inordinately time-consuming. They are also used for low-volume production of specialty hardwoods used in furniture, and can be used to produce the large timbers used in post-and-beam framing techniques.|$|E
