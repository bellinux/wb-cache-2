5|$|Gorgosaurus {{lived in}} a lush {{floodplain}} environment along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs. In some areas, Gorgosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Daspletosaurus. Although these animals were roughly the same size, {{there is some evidence}} of niche differentiation between the two. Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its ontogeny, life history and other aspects of its biology.|$|E
5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} grid reference 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle {{is located on the}} southern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open downland ridge at a height of 680 feet above sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on the rim of Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low {{at the time of the}} circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive panoramic views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E

Six more great circles represent the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> icosidodecahedron, and the last ten great circles come from the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the uniform star dodecadodecahedron, making pentagrams with vertices at the <b>edge</b> centers <b>of</b> the icosahedron.|$|R
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an absorption <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> atom, which {{changes the}} scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the}} middle of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E

25|$|Speed bumps vary in length, but it {{is typical}} to leave space between the bump and either <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{enclosed}} road (i.e. with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage.

25|$|It was {{deposited}} in a shallow, hot and salty sea, on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> equatorial continent. The water depth never exceeded , and shallowed {{over time as}} bioherm detritus, and terrestrial sediments, filled the basin. Reef growth started in the Llandovery, when the sea was , and reefs continued to dominate the sedimentary record.

25|$|The loose, broken, and sharp, spiny {{surface of}} an aā flow makes hiking {{difficult}} and slow. The clinkery surface actually covers a massive dense core, {{which is the}} most active part of the flow. As pasty lava in the core travels downslope, the clinkers are carried along at the surface. At the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aā flow, however, these cooled fragments tumble down the steep front and are buried by the advancing flow. This produces a layer of lava fragments both at the bottom and top of an aā flow.|$|E
25|$|This {{computation}} {{using the}} induced EMF method {{is identical to}} the computation of the mutual impedance between two dipoles (with infinitesimal conductor radius) separated by the distance a. Because the field at or beyond the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antenna's cylindrical conductor at a distance a is only dependent on the current distribution along the conductor, and not the radius of the conductor, that field is used to compute the mutual impedance between that filamentary antenna and the actual position of the conductor with a radius a. This then supplies the self-impedance of the conductor itself.|$|E
25|$|EXAFS spectra are {{displayed}} as graphs of the absorption coefficient {{of a given}} material versus energy, typically in a 500 – 1000 eV range beginning before an absorption <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element in the sample. The x-ray absorption coefficient is usually normalized to unit step height. This is done by regressing a line to the region {{before and after the}} absorption edge, subtracting the pre-edge line from the entire data set and dividing by the absorption step height, which is determined by the difference between the pre-edge and post-edge lines at the value of E0 (on the absorption edge).|$|E

25|$|The hotel had 29 {{rooms and}} suites built on palafittes {{that were on}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> estuary. The rooms were named after Mexican lotería card riddles; each room was {{different}} and was themed and decorated inside according to its card name. To reach their rooms, guests had to use rowboats on a waterway, and raised a flagpole for means of communication. Morning coffee was given to guests after they pulled a rope from their room that erected a red flag. The absence of mobile phones and telephones was intended to bring an isolation experience. In addition, Hotelito Desconocido did not use electricity and was excluded from human settlements nearby. During the night, the hosts burnt candles, torches, and luminaries to light the hotel and pathways. The illumination of the moonlight was also an intended part of the night experience. Throughout the afternoon, guests were encouraged to horseback riding along the beach, biking through the palm trails, kayaking, playing volleyball, or billiards. There were also bird-watching and baby turtle release activities since the area had over 150 bird species and 3 different turtle species.|$|E
25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
