60|$|At that moment, and in {{the very}} {{extremity}} of his apprehensions, there fell of a sudden a knock upon the door, sounding so loud and so startling upon {{the silence of the}} room that every shattered nerve in our hero's frame tingled and thrilled in answer to it. He stood petrified, scarcely so much as daring to breathe; and then, observing that his mouth was agape, he moistened his dry and parching lips, and <b>drew</b> his <b>jaws</b> together with a snap.|$|R

60|$|After some {{manipulation}} {{he managed}} to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he carried it to his mouth. The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth. He <b>drew</b> the lower <b>jaw</b> in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match. He succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap. He was no better off. He could not pick it up. Then he devised a way. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the snow and went out.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -Human {{experience}} of the toxicity of radium acts {{as a guide for}} the setting of occupationally permissible levels for radioactive nucleides, especially bone-seekers. Reviewing the published statements and photomicrographs in early reports especially those of Martland (1931) one can make a case that malignancy was induced in bone-marrow (leukaemia, malignant myelosclerosis) as well as in bone (osteosarcoma) by radium, especially with large doses. Three case reports of radium intoxication in Britons are noted as compatible with this suggestion, after revised interpretation in two of them. RADIUM POISONING WE still rely very heavily on rather inadequate human {{experience of}} the radiotoxicity of radium for regulating occupational exposure of man to internal contamination with radioactive substances. The first report on radium poisoning is attributed to a dentist (Blum, 1924) who, in a discussion on osteomyelitis of the <b>jaws,</b> <b>drew</b> attention to a condition of " radium jaw " he had seen in luminizers, young women who painted dial...|$|R
50|$|After a {{break for}} internationals, United {{travelled}} to Goodison Park on 11 September to take on Everton: {{the first of a}} league double-header against Liverpudlian opposition. Everton had the upper hand for the first half-hour, while Uniteds best chances were denied by saves from Tim Howard. Following a 39th-minute corner off one of these saves, Evra failed to deal with a long ball out of the Everton defence, allowing Mikel Arteta to bear down on Edwin van der Sars goal; the Dutch goalkeeper saved Artetas shot, but the rebound fell to Leon Osman, who squared the ball for Steven Pienaar to side-foot under Van der Sar and into the net. However, Evertons lead was short-lived as Giggs found Nani on the right wing, and the Portuguese bent over an early cross for Fletcher to volley home. United took the lead for the first time two minutes after half-time: a Nani corner was half-cleared by Osman before the ball came back to Nani, who crossed for the unmarked Nemanja Vidić to head home. Berbatov made it 3-1 in the 65th minute with a shot off the outside of his boot from just outside the penalty area after he beat Distin to a long ball from Scholes. The score remained at 3-1 until the 90th minute, when two Everton attacks down the left wing produced goals for Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta, salvaging a <b>draw</b> from the <b>jaws</b> of defeat.|$|R
