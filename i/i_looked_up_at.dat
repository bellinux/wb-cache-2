2500|$|.....about {{two o'clock}} today..we were startled by a most violent thundering explosion, {{followed}} by another, in quick succession, the earth shook and trembled... I was so frightened...a shell burst very near, {{for a little}} stream of blue smoke came in one door and passed out the other... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Fort Lyon, which at that moment went up with a tremendous shock...It...looked...like the pictures of Vesuvus [...] during an eruption... Everything flew up from the center and seemed to stand still for a moment...then...pieces of steel, stones, and dirt, came rattling, and thundering down...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon, [...] There was {{in their}} tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him to {{read the}} signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.|$|E
5000|$|... "Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi o" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Up</b> <b>at</b> the Stars of the Night) (Kyu Sakamoto cover) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strong!--of {{course it}} is, {{unnecessarily}} strong," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> its edge, {{over which the}} water, rendered muddy by the rains, flowed in a considerable volume. [...] "What think you, Lumley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Rarely {{did that}} {{hour of the}} evening come, rarely did I wake at night, rarely did <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon, or stars, or watch the falling rain, or hear the wind, but I thought of his solitary figure toiling on, poor pilgrim, and {{recalled}} the words: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{rest of his}} remark was {{drowned out}} in a clap of thunder. Somewhat startled, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Miss Haldin in {{sympathetic}} consternation, but Miss Haldin {{was looking}} down calmly at her mother. The latter said-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and he was}} as calm as when he had joked with me {{a quarter}} of an hour since.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Tripp," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him rather impatiently, [...] "how goes it?" [...] He {{was looking}} to-day more miserable, more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than I {{had ever seen}} him. He was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know the}} bare rocky bluff {{that stands out}} {{prominently}} on the hill across the creek. From that spot Colonel Zane first saw the valley, and from there I leaped my horse. I can never convince myself that it really happened. Often <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> that cliff in doubt. But the Indians and Colonel Zane, Jonathan, Wetzel and others say they actually saw the deed done, so I must accept it," [...] said Major McColloch.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{go to see}} her! <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her if {{she were}} to pass my window this instant. She was with Mr. Lodge, of course. What did he say or do?' ...|$|R
60|$|Again we paused. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} an inextricable medley of {{emotions}} struggling together in my mind, and shook my head.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} noise she made. [...] "TWICE!" [...] she said, smiling indulgently, [...] "to-day!" [...] (Even the smile was Altiora's.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. His good, homely {{face was}} close to mine, and in his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> sharply <b>at</b> {{the doctor}} from such pensive embroidery, {{and found him}} {{as far away as}} I. He nodded and smiled, and we shook hands on the bank in the thick mist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] said Charley. [...] "When father's black bull chased Kate {{and me in}} the prairies, {{and almost}} overtook us as we ran for the fence of the big field, I felt my heart leap to my mouth, and the blood rush to my cheeks, as I turned about and faced him, while Kate climbed the fence; but after she was over, I felt a wild sort of wickedness in me, as if I should like to tantalise and torment him,--and I felt {{altogether}} different from what I feel now while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> these black clouds. Isn't there something quite awful in them, Harry?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> stopped, and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Giuliana. She {{smiled at}} me through unshed tears that {{magnified}} her matchless eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the big stone {{buildings}} before us. My {{father was}} behind those walls. I glanced at Kate. The poor girl was in tears.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky, Mannion {{stepped back}} a few paces, and pointed in the {{direction}} of the fishing-hamlet from which I had departed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Cavalcanti, baffled, {{and sick}} with sudden dismay. I saw Cavalcanti's eye, which had grown dull, kindle anew. He stooped over the {{prostrate}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am glad to}} hear it,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'Behold {{the wonders}} of the firmament, Mrs Lupin! how glorious is the scene! When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> those shining orbs, I think that each of them is winking to the other to take notice of the vanity of men's pursuits. My fellow-men!' cried Mr Pecksniff, shaking his head in pity; 'you are much mistaken; my wormy relatives, you are much deceived! The stars are {{perfectly}} contented (I suppose so) in their several spheres. Why are not you? Oh! do not strive and struggle to enrich yourselves, or to get the better of each other, my deluded friends, but <b>look</b> <b>up</b> there, with me!' ...|$|R
60|$|The passage {{was soon}} {{accomplished}} {{by means of}} rafts, and many thousands of Russians having already preceded us we experienced no opposition. It was daylight when we rode into a village on the Bulgarian shore, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> sleepily <b>at</b> the cottages as we passed.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> back <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the dark}} hill {{and thought of}} Sally Langdon. Getting here to Linrock, meeting Steele had not changed my {{feelings}} toward her, only somehow they had removed me far off in thought, out of possible touch, it seemed.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Thark, a smile upon my own lips, {{for here}} in truth was greater {{need for a}} smiling face than a {{trembling}} chin.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her wrung {{and bitter}} face. [...] "I haven't hated it," [...] I lied, my voice near {{breaking}} {{with the pain}} of it all. [...] "Have you?" ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. I couldn't say, but in {{any case}} I was too clever for him. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the stars, and yawned loud at them as if I was {{tremendous}} sleepy.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{of these}} days," [...] said Jimmy plaintively, [...] "I shall be {{sitting by the}} {{roadside}} with my dinner-pail, and you will come by in your limousine, and <b>I</b> shall <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> you and say 'You hounded me into this!' How will you feel then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{stopped and}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. She started back from {{me with a}} scream of terror. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> down again at the title-page, and read the next lines-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once when I went to Throope Great Pond {{to catch}} effets <b>I</b> seed myself <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> myself, and <b>I</b> was frightened and jumped back like anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} used to him, papa. He seemed {{exceedingly}} tall to me at first--like a tower when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; but, on the whole, I would rather not have him otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, granny," [...] said I, with a flutter at my heart, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her thin}} careworn face, {{and began to}} break the ice with caution, [...] "I've come--I--there's a little piece of--of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. [...] "Oh, if {{you have}} any notion of being married I wish you would right off," [...] I said eagerly. [...] "Any wedding would do just as well as Pamelia's. Please do." ...|$|E
60|$|She had {{gazed at}} the {{addressed}} envelope, smiled (<b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her from my desk), and at last took it up with an effort of sanctimonious repugnance. But she remained with it in her hand looking at me {{as though she were}} piously gloating over something she could read in my face.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{and glanced}} <b>at</b> old Indaba-zimbi, {{who was sitting}} near. But it was not till {{afterwards}} that I told Stella of how her vision was brought about.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} mean the Riverside Franchise," [...] <b>I</b> said. He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me, miserably, from the chair into which he had sunk, {{his hands in his}} pockets.|$|R
