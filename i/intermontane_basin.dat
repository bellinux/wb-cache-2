25|$|While the Llanos Basin to the {{southeast}} experienced a foreland basin setting since the Paleogene, due to the first phases of uplift of the Eastern Ranges, the Cesar-Ranchería Basin was characterised by an <b>intermontane</b> <b>basin</b> setting with forming mountain ranges {{to the north and}} southeast; the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Serranía del Perijá respectively. Inside the basin, the main compressional movement is dated to this phase, where reverse faults were formed.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the time}} lags {{inherent}} in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies, decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated. In brief, the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves. In a classic study in 1982, Bredehoeft and colleagues modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an <b>intermontane</b> <b>basin</b> withdrew the entire annual recharge, leaving ‘nothing’ for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community. Even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation, 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by the lag {{inherent in the}} system after 100 years. By year 500, this had reduced to 0%, signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation. The science has been available to make these calculations for decades; however, in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear outside the rough timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years). Marios Sophocleous argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate timeframes in groundwater planning. This will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades, sometimes centuries in the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Detailed examination of Nite-IR images of <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins</b> in arid and/or semiarid areas of California discloses a ring or halo of relatively lighter greytone {{around the edges}} of each <b>basin.</b> <b>Intermontane</b> <b>basins</b> in the Northern Coast Range, however, do not show this thermal haloing. The topographic elevation of the haloes in arid basins shows seasonal variation, but it is present on nearly all images. A similar halo encircles many of the volcanoes on the Modoc Plateau and Southern Cascade Range. Although the halo around the arid <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins</b> can possibly be explained in relation to the location of alluvial fans (and perhaps water content of the rocks), a similar explanation cannot be made for the haloes around volcanoes or for the lack of haloes around basins in the Coast Range. Atmospheric thermal layering may be an alternative explanation; however, this explanation is also riddled with inconsistencies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Bastardo Basin {{is one of}} the {{classics}} Apenninic <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins</b> of central Italy. They are en-closed tectonic basins (graben and semigraben) with high anthropization, but with high vulnerability, too (seismic, hydrogeological and geomorphological). The paper concerns some aspects about slope instability in the Bastardo Basin as part of a wider research, which aims to actually define the characteristics of the liability to landslides of the Apenninic <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins.</b> In particular lithological, stratigraphical and hydrogeological conditions are analysed under which a landslide near village of Barattano has developed. This mass movement, at different times, produced partial or total occlusion of the torrent Puglia. Here geognostic investigations together with laboratory tests and subsequent monitoring of landslide area were carried out. A back analysis, based on limit equilibrium solutions for the factor of safety of the slope, provided the residual strenght properties of the soil mass along the sliding surface. The landslide of Barattano is representative of a very frequent situation (in terms of type, factors and causes of the movement, possible development of the movement) not only within Bastardo Basin, but in general within Apenninic <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins,</b> too. The study of landslide and the design of appropriate remedial measures are of great importance in terms of prevention and mitigation of geologic-hydraulic risk in Apenninic <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R

In the last 20 years, the grasslands have been underused. It was revealed that current spatial distribution of grasslands is different from the classic scheme of natural climate-induced vegetation distribution. Species composition of meadow steppes is similar in different locations and does not reflect climatic differences of “dry” leeward and “wet” windward slopes of the <b>intermontane</b> <b>basins.</b> Present-day soils reflect parent material differences and erosion degree, but not topography-induced local climate specificity.
