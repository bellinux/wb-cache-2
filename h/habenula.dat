50|$|The outputs of {{the lateral}} <b>habenula</b> target dopaminergic regions (substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area), serotonergic regions (median raphe and dorsal raphe nuclei), and a {{cholinergic}} region (the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus). This output inhibits dopamine neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area, with activation in the lateral <b>habenula</b> linking to deactivation in them, and vice versa, deactivation in the lateral <b>habenula</b> with their activation. The lateral <b>habenula</b> functions {{to oppose the}} action of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in the acquisition of avoidance responses but not the processing of avoidance later on when it is a memory, motivation or its execution.

40|$|The habenular nuclei of the {{limbic system}} {{regulate}} responses, such as anxiety, to aversive stimuli in the environment. The <b>habenulae</b> receive inputs from the telencephalon via elaborate dendrites that {{form in the}} center of the nuclei. The kinase Ulk 2 positively regulates dendritogenesis on habenular neurons, and in turn is negatively regulated by the cytoplasmic protein Kctd 12. Given that the <b>habenulae</b> are a nexus in the aversive response circuit, we suspected that incomplete habenular dendritogenesis would have profound implications for behavior. We find that Ulk 2, which interacts with Kctd 12 proteins via a small proline-serine rich domain, promotes branching and elaboration of dendrites. Loss of Kctd 12 results in increased branching/elaboration and decreased anxiety. We conclude that fine-tuning of habenular dendritogenesis during development is essential for appropriate behavioral responses to negative stimuli...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSecreted Wnt {{proteins}} play pivotal {{roles in}} development, including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, progenitor maintenance and tissue patterning. The transmembrane protein Wntless (Wls) {{is necessary for}} secretion of most Wnts and essential for effective Wnt signaling. During a mutagenesis screen to identify genes important for development of the habenular nuclei in the dorsal forebrain, we isolated a mutation in the sole wls gene of zebrafish and confirmed its identity with a second, independent allele. Early embryonic development appears normal in homozygous wls mutants, but they later lack the ventral habenular nuclei, form smaller dorsal <b>habenulae</b> and otic vesicles, have truncated jaw and fin cartilages and lack swim bladders. Activation of a reporter for β-catenin-dependent transcription is decreased in wls mutants, indicative of impaired signaling by the canonical Wnt pathway, and expression of Wnt-responsive genes is reduced in the dorsal diencephalon. Wnt signaling was previously implicated in patterning of the zebrafish brain and in the generation of left–right (L–R) differences between the bilaterally paired dorsal habenular nuclei. Outside of the epithalamic region, development of the brain is largely normal in wls mutants and, despite their reduced size, the dorsal <b>habenulae</b> retain L–R asymmetry. We find that homozygous wls mutants show a reduction in two cell populations {{that contribute to the}} presumptive dorsal <b>habenulae.</b> The results support distinct temporal requirements for Wls in habenular development and reveal a new role for Wnt signaling in the regulation of dorsal habenular progenitors...|$|R
40|$|The <b>habenulae</b> {{are highly}} conserved nuclei in the dorsal {{diencephalon}} that connect the forebrain to the midbrain and hindbrain. These nuclei have {{been implicated in}} a broad variety of behaviours in humans, primates, rodents and zebrafish. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms that control the genesis and differentiation of neural progenitors in the <b>habenulae</b> remain relatively unknown. We have previously shown that, in zebrafish, the timing of habenular neurogenesis is left-right asymmetric {{and that in the}} absence of Nodal signalling this asymmetry is lost. Here, we show that habenular neurogenesis requires the homeobox transcription factor Pax 6 a and the redundant action of two proneural bHLH factors, Neurog 1 and Neurod 4. We present evidence that Hedgehog signalling is required for the expression of pax 6 a, which is in turn necessary for the expression of neurog 1 and neurod 4. Finally, we demonstrate by pharmacological inhibition that Hedgehog signalling is required continuously during habenular neurogenesis and by cell transplantation experiments that pathway activation is required cell autonomously. Our data sheds light on the mechanism underlying habenular development that may provide insights into how Nodal signalling imposes asymmetry on the timing of habenular neurogenesis.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIAlthough {{progress}} has been made in resolving the genetic pathways that specify neuronal asymmetries in the brain, little is known about genes that mediate the development of structural asymmetries between neurons on left and right. In this study, we identify daam 1 a as an asymmetric component of the signalling pathways leading to asymmetric morphogenesis of the <b>habenulae</b> in zebrafish. Daam 1 a is a member of the Formin family of actin-binding proteins and the extent of Daam 1 a expression in habenular neuron dendrites mirrors the asymmetric growth of habenular neuropil between left and right. Local loss and gain of Daam 1 a function affects neither cell number nor subtype organisation but leads to a decrease or increase of neuropil, respectively. Daam 1 a therefore plays a key role in the asymmetric growth of habenular neuropil downstream of the pathways that specify asymmetric cellular domains in the <b>habenulae.</b> In addition, Daam 1 a mediates the development of habenular efferent connectivity as local loss and gain of Daam 1 a function impairs or enhances, respectively, the growth of habenular neuron terminals in the interpeduncular nucleus. Abrogation of Daam 1 a disrupts the growth of both dendritic and axonal processes and results in disorganised filamentous actin and α-tubulin. Our results indicate that Daam 1 a plays a key role in asymmetric habenular morphogenesis mediating the growth of dendritic and axonal processes in dorsal habenular neurons...|$|R
40|$|The sex {{determining}} region Y-box 2 (sox 2) gene {{is one of}} {{the most}} important transcription factors during development, particularly the development of the central nervous system (CNS). It is expressed in embryonic stem cells and later in neural stem cells, where it modulates their maintenance and differentiation. In humans, heterozygous mutations are associated with eye malformations, including anophthalmia and severe microphthalmia. Also, a subset of patients has extra-ocular phenotypes, such as hearing loss, seizures and pituitary hypoplasia. Although the roles of sox 2 in embryonic stem cells and eye development are well studied, the function of sox 2 in brain development and disease is still elusive. The aim of this project was to characterize a novel role for sox 2 in the development of zebrafish epithalamus, which was identified from an in silico screen previously performed in our laboratory. The zebrafish epithalamus, located in the dorsal diencephalon, consists of three main structures: the pineal gland, the parapineal organ and the habenular nuclei. The pineal gland, also known as epiphysis, is a photoreceptive (in zebrafish) and neuroendocrine organ that detects light and rhythmically produces melatonin in order to regulate the circadian rhythms. The parapineal organ is located to the left side of the pineal gland and is important for the elaboration of the asymmetries observed between the left and right habenular nuclei. Finally, the bilateral <b>habenulae</b> are part of the dorsal diencephalic conduction system that links the forebrain with the mid- and hindbrain. The left and right <b>habenulae</b> show both molecular and neuroanatomical asymmetries, including differences in neuropil organization, in levels of gene expression and in the morphology and connectivity of their neurons’ projections. The relatively simple architecture of the pineal gland and the asymmetric character of the <b>habenulae</b> provide a useful tool for studying cell-fate determination, cell migration and establishment of brain asymmetries. In this study, we used zebrafish as a model to dissect the novel functions of sox 2 in the development of the epithalamus. We showed that sox 2 works synergistically with Notch pathway to negatively regulate neurogenesis within the pineal gland. The pineal gland consists of only two cell types: the photoreceptors and the projection neurons. Previous studies showed that the Notch and BMP pathways are important for the proper specification of these cells. Here, we show that sox 2 normally inhibits the photoreceptor cell fate, whereas it has no effect on the number of projection neurons. Therefore, sox 2 complements Notch and BMP pathways in cell-fate determination within the pineal gland. In addition, downregulation of sox 2 results in abnormal parapineal organ development and disruption of the asymmetric architecture of the <b>habenulae.</b> A subset of sox 2 morphant embryos develops right-sided parapineal organs, which is consistent with abnormal bilateral expression of the Nodal gene, pitx 2 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2). Also, timelapse experiments showed that migration of the parapineal cells is defective, resulting in scattered cells. The aberrant parapineal development leads to disorganization of the habenular nuclei, as shown by the abnormal neuropil arrangement and the expression of the asymmetric marker kctd 12. 1 (potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing 12. 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Functional {{lateralization}} is a conserved {{feature of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). However, underlying left-right asymmetries within neural circuitry and the mechanisms by which they develop are poorly described. Results In this study, we use focal electroporation to examine the morphology and connectivity of individual neurons of the lateralized habenular nuclei. Habenular projection neurons {{on both sides of the}} brain share a stereotypical unipolar morphology and elaborate remarkable spiraling terminal arbors in their target interpeduncular nucleus, a morphology unlike that of any other class of neuron described to date. There are two quite distinct sub-types of axon arbor that differ both in branching morphology and in their localization within the target nucleus. Critically, both arbor morphologies are elaborated by both left and right-sided neurons, but at greatly differing frequencies. We show that these differences in cell type composition account for the gross connectional asymmetry displayed by the left and right <b>habenulae.</b> Analysis of the morphology and projections of individual post-synaptic neurons suggests that the target nucleus has the capacity to either integrate left and right inputs or to handle them independently, potentially relaying information from the left and right <b>habenulae</b> within distinct downstream pathways, thus preserving left-right coding. Furthermore, we find that signaling from the unilateral, left-sided parapineal nucleus is necessary for both left and right axons to develop arbors with appropriate morphology and targeting. However, following parapineal ablation, left and right habenular neurons continue to elaborate arbors with distinct, lateralized morphologies. Conclusion By taking the analysis of asymmetric neural circuitry to the level of single cells, we have resolved left-right differences in circuit microarchitecture and show that lateralization can be recognized at the level of the morphology and connectivity of single projection neuron axons. Crucially, the same circuitry components are specified on both sides of the brain, but differences in the ratios of different neuronal sub-types results in a lateralized neural architecture and gross connectional asymmetry. Although signaling from the parapineal is essential for the development of normal lateralization, additional factors clearly act during development to confer left-right identity upon neurons in this highly conserved circuit. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>habenulae</b> {{are part}} of an {{evolutionarily}} highly conserved limbic-system conduction pathway that connects telencephalic nuclei to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) of the midbrain [1]. In zebrafish, unilateral activation of the Nodal signaling pathway in the left brain specifies the laterality of the asymmetry of habenular size [2 – 5]. We show “laterotopy” in the habenulo-interpeduncular projection in zebrafish, i. e., the stereotypic, topographic projection of left-sided habenular axons to the dorsal region of the IPN and of right-sided habenular axons to the ventral IPN. This asymmetric projection is accounted for by a prominent left-right (LR) difference in the size ratio of the medial and lateral habenular sub-nuclei, each of which specifically projects either to ventral or dorsal IPN targets. Asymmetric Nodal signaling directs the orientation of laterotopy but is dispensable for the establishment of laterotopy itself. Our results reveal a mechanism by which information distributed between left and right sides of the brain can be transmitted bilaterally without loss of LR coding, which may {{play a crucial role in}} functional lateralization of the vertebrate brain [6, 7]...|$|R
40|$|By means {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry, we have {{provided}} a detailed neuroanatomical mapping of proliferative activity during development and adulthood in the frog (Rana esculenta) brain. Western blot analysis confirmed {{the presence of this}} protein in brain extracts from adults and tadpoles. Proliferative activity was observed in the ventricular and subventricular zones throughout the brain. The present study provides details as to which of the morphologically distinguishable brain region(s) has a long-lasting proliferative activity and in which region this activity undergoes a progressive decrease during development. In the subventricular zones of the third ventricle, PCNAlabeled cells were particularly abundant in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. It was observed that proliferation zones are present practically in all major subdivisions of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain, including the cerebellum in which PCNA-labeled cells were located in the outer granular layer and the inner molecular layer. The <b>habenulae,</b> epiphysis and isthmic nuclei never showed the presence of PCNA-immunoreactive nuclei. The widespread proliferative activity implies that the frog brain has a great potential for neurogenesis/gliogenesis not only during larval development but also in the adulthood...|$|R

50|$|The habenular nuclei {{comprise}} {{a small group}} of nuclei {{that are part of the}} epithalamus of the diencephalon, and is located just above the thalamus and is divided into two asymmetric halves, the medial <b>habenula</b> (MHb) and the lateral <b>habenula</b> (LHb) that regulate monamines, such as dopamine and serotonin. Information from the posterior septum and a portion of Broca's area feeds into the MHb, and a region of the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, and a portion of Broca's area all feed into the LHb. As a whole, this complexly interconnected region is part of the dorsal diencephalic conduction (DDC) system, responsible for relaying information from the limbic system to the midbrain, hindbrain, and medial forebrain.|$|E

40|$|SummaryLeft-right asymmetries {{are most}} likely a {{universal}} feature of bilaterian nervous systems and may serve to increase neural capacity by specializing equivalent structures on left and right sides for distinct roles [1]. However, {{little is known about}} how asymmetries are encoded within vertebrate neural circuits and how lateralization influences processing of information in the brain. Consequently, it remains unclear the extent to which lateralization of the nervous system is important for normal cognitive and other brain functions and whether defects in lateralization contribute to neurological deficits [2]. Here we show that sensory responses to light and odor are lateralized in larval zebrafish <b>habenulae</b> and that loss of brain asymmetry leads to concomitant loss of responsiveness to either visual or olfactory stimuli. We find that in wild-type zebrafish, most habenular neurons responding to light are present on the left, whereas neurons responding to odor are more frequent on the right. Manipulations that reverse the direction of brain asymmetry reverse the functional properties of habenular neurons, whereas manipulations that generate either double-left- or double-right-sided brains lead to loss of habenular responsiveness to either odor or light, respectively. Our results indicate that loss of brain lateralization has significant consequences upon sensory processing and circuit function...|$|R
40|$|Gap {{junctions}} are membrane specializations {{that allow}} the passage of ions and small molecules from one cell to another. In vertebrates, connexins are the protein subunits that assemble to form gap junctional plaques. Connexin- 35 (Cx 35) is the fish ortholog of mammalian connexin- 36, which is enriched in the retina and the brain and {{has been shown to}} form neuronal gap junctions. As a first step towards understanding the role of neuronal gap junctions in central nervous system (CNS) development, we describe here the distribution of Cx 35 in the CNS during zebrafish development. Cx 35 expression is first seen at 1 day post fertilization (dpf) along cell boundaries throughout the nervous system. At 2 dpf, Cx 35 immunoreactivity appears in commissures and fiber tracts throughout the CNS and along the edges of the tectal neuropil. In the rhombencephalon, the Mauthner neurons and fiber tracts show strong Cx 35 immunoreactivity. As the larva develops, the commissures and fiber tracts continue to be immunoreactive for Cx 35. In addition, the area of the tectal neuropil stained increases vastly and tectal commissures are visible. Furthermore, at 4 - 5 dpf, Cx 35 is seen in the <b>habenulae,</b> cerebellum and in radial glia lining the rhombencephalic ventricle. This pattern of Cx 35 immunoreactivity is stable at least until 15 dpf. To test whether the Cx 35 immunoreactivity seen corresponds to functional gap junctional coupling, we documented the number of dye-coupled neurons in the hindbrain. We found several dye-coupled neurons within the reticulospinal network indicating functional gap junctional connectivity in the developing zebrafish brain...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} <b>habenulae</b> (Hb) is {{an evolutionary}} conserved dorsal diencephalic nuclear complex that relays information from limbic and striatal forebrain regions to the ventral midbrain. One key {{feature of this}} bilateral nucleus {{is the presence of}} left-right differences in size, cytoarchitecture, connectivity, neurochemistry and/or gene expression. In teleosts, habenular asymmetry has been associated with preferential innervation of left-right habenular efferents into dorso-ventral domains of the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). However, the degree of conservation of this trait and its relation to the structural asymmetries of the Hb are currently unknown. To address these questions, we performed the first systematic comparative analysis of structural and connectional asymmetries of the Hb in teleosts. We found striking inter-species variability in the overall shape and cytoarchitecture of the Hb, and in the frequency, strength and to a lesser degree, laterality of habenular volume at the population level. Directional asymmetry of the Hb was either to the left in D. rerio, E. bicolor, O. latipes, P. reticulata, B. splendens, or to the right in F. gardneri females. In contrast, asymmetry was absent in P. scalare and F. gardneri males at the population level, although in these species the Hb displayed volumetric asymmetries at the individual level. Inter-species variability was more pronounced across orders than within a single order, and coexisted with an overall conserved laterotopic representation of left-right habenular efferents into dorso-ventral domains of the IPN. These results suggest that the circuit design involving the Hb of teleosts promotes structural flexibility depending o...|$|R
