Barbossa and his crew suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead.

5|$|After {{doing some}} more searching, Veronica discovers {{that one of}} the lab members {{actually}} stole the monkey after developing a special bond with it. The lab member <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> blame it on PHAT. Veronica decides to tell the other lab members that she was unable to find the monkey, although she is surprised to learn that they will quickly get another monkey. Veronica has a heartfelt conversation with Piz, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan. Keith decides to take the case of Dean O’Dell’s death.

5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high water mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the Luftwaffe and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not expect effective air support. The Luftwaffe could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Doohan {{moved to}} London, Ontario for further {{technical}} education.

There he won a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where his classmates included Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall and Richard Boone.|$|E

25|$|Having {{very limited}} {{resources}} meant {{much about the}} filmmaking process relied heavily on the pragmatism of the filmmakers and their determination to get it done. Pre-production focussed on having a great script, finding a great cinematographer, actors, and music. The directors were inspired by the mumblecore movement of filmmakers. Alex Lisman the cinematographer had a documentary background so the directors <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> shoot fast and solidly.|$|E
25|$|In {{much of his}} career, Saionji {{tried to}} {{diminish}} {{the influence of the}} Imperial Japanese Army in political issues.

However, he was careful to pick his battles, and would concede defeat when he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not win (e.g. his inability to prevent the Tripartite Pact).|$|E

25|$|Lee {{soon learned}} that Pleasonton had {{withdrawn}} to Aldie, Virginia. He then <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> leave the heavily reinforced positions in Virginia and hasten his movement into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Ewell's corps, with Albert G. Jenkins's cavalry brigade were to march toward the Susquehanna River to gather food and supplies. Lee ordered Brigadier General John D. Imboden to lead his cavalry brigade across the Potomac to join Ewell's corps if opportunity offered, but Imboden decided {{he did not have}} that opportunity and stayed behind.|$|E
25|$|Minos {{was also}} part of the King Nisus story. Nisus was King of Megara, and he was invincible as long as a lock of crimson hair still existed, hidden in his white hair. Minos {{attacked}} Megara but Nisus <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not be beaten because he still had his lock of crimson hair. His daughter, Scylla, fell in love with Minos and proved it by cutting the crimson hair off her father's head. Nisus died and Megara fell to Crete. Minos spurned Scylla for disobeying her father. She was changed into a shearer bird, relentlessly pursued by her father, who was a falcon.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Great War, he was given command of the Home Defence Army, part of Ian Hamilton's Home Defence Central Force. However, following the sudden death of Sir James Grierson, he was placed in charge of the British Expeditionary Force II Corps, by Lord Kitchener, the new Secretary of State for War. Field Marshal Sir John French had wanted Sir Herbert Plumer but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stand up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him. Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.|$|E

25|$|Berthold took {{command of}} the big bomber. He left the Eindekker to Buddecke; this {{decision}} sped Buddecke {{on his way to}} {{being a member of the}} first wave of German aces that included Oswald Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and Kurt Wintgens. Berthold <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> cross the lines searching for opponents in the AEG G.II, while the Eindekker was ordered to patrol only behind German lines. However, Berthold damaged his original G.II in a landing accident on 15 September, and had to return to piloting an old two-seater. On 21 September 1915, Rudolf Berthold was promoted to Oberleutnant. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany to pick up a replacement G.II. By 1 October, he had it in action for bombing, as well as a gunship for air defense missions. On 6 November, one of those missions turned deadly; a British Vickers F.B.5 gunner mortally wounded Gruener. Berthold was depressed by his friend's death, and sent on home leave, vowing vengeance for Greuner's death.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstance}} of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{that the}} New York Central now {{depended}} heavily on connecting lines to reach Midwestern cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis, Vanderbilt decided to add Amasa Stone to the Central's board of directors. Stone was first {{appointed to the}} board in 1867, and probably served until December 1868. In April 1868, Stone {{played a major role}} in bringing together Cornelius Vanderbilt and the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Vanderbilt very much wanted the New York Central to carry both raw and refined oil being shipped by Rockefeller. On April 18, 1868, Vanderbilt asked Rockefeller (then visiting New York City) to meet with him. Rockefeller refused, sending only his business card. He believed Vanderbilt would try to charge him high freightage rates, and Rockefeller <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get his oil to refineries and consumers without Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt persisted, however, and later that afternoon sent Amasa Stone to visit Rockefeller at Rockefeller's hotel. The two Clevelanders spoke for several hours, and Stone convinced Rockefeller to see Vanderbilt. The two men met that evening, and began a long and fruitful business relationship.|$|E

500|$|The {{first to}} arrive at Emmindingen, the French secured the high point at Waldkirch, which {{commanded}} the neighboring valleys; it was considered, at the time, a maxim of military tactics, that command of the mountains gave control of the valleys. By 19 October, the armies faced each other, {{on the banks of}} the Elz from Waldkirch to Emmendingen. [...] By then, Moreau <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not proceed to Kehl along the right bank of the Rhine, so he decided to cross the Rhine further north, at Breisach.
