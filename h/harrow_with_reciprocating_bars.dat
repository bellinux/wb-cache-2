25|$|The Liberty {{ships were}} the last major {{steamship}} class equipped <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> engine. The last Victory ships had already been equipped with marine diesels, and diesel engine superseded both steamers and windjammers soon after the World War Two. Most steamers were used up to their maximum economical life span, and no commercial ocean-going steamers <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> engines have been built after the 1960s.|$|R

25|$|In the 1950s {{there were}} far fewer orders for ships <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> steam engines. However, geared steam {{turbines}} are more compact, {{more powerful and}} less vibratory than reciprocating engines. Early in the 1950s Burntisland took two orders for steam turbine cargo ships.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ships of}} the class were 75.7 m long, had a draught of 5.18 m, and had a {{displacement}} of 3,200 ton. The ships were equipped <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> engines, which were rated at [...] and produced {{a top speed of}} 16 kn.|$|R
5000|$|Combines are {{equipped}} with removable heads that are designed for particular crops. The standard header, sometimes called a grain platform, is equipped <b>with</b> a <b>reciprocating</b> knife cutter <b>bar,</b> and features a revolving reel with metal or plastic teeth to cause the cut crop {{to fall into the}} auger once it is cut. A variation of the platform, a [...] "flex" [...] platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.|$|R
50|$|Their {{ability to}} work at higher {{pressures}} has led to marine boilers being almost entirely water-tube. This change began around 1900, and traced the adoption of turbines for propulsion rather than reciprocating (i.e. piston) engines - although watertube boilers were also used <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> engines.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Manufacturers have {{introduced}} instruments made with new alloys and <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> motion {{trying to improve}} the fracture resistance of rotary NiTi files.

Material/methods: Canal preparation was performed on 100 Endo-Training Block simulators divided in two equal groups, depending on the file used. Average lifespan and cumulative survival at the time of WaveOne files (Dentsply Maillefer) <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> rotation and One Shape files (Micro Mega) with continuous rotation, after a glide path creation, were tested.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of biplane designs have been fitted <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> engines of comparatively low power; exceptions include the Antonov An-3 and WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor, fitted with turboprop and turbofan engines respectively.

50|$|Shut-off nozzles {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} process of plastic injection molding. Machine shut-off nozzles serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (<b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike hot runner nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine shut-off nozzles differ from open nozzles because of their closable melt channel.|$|R

50|$|For greater efficiency, a heat {{recovery}} steam generator (HRSG) is added at the exhaust. This {{is known as}} a combined cycle plant. Cogeneration uses waste exhaust heat for process, district heating or other heating uses. Both of these options are used only in plants that are intended to be operated for longer periods than usual. Natural gas and diesel generators <b>with</b> <b>reciprocating</b> engines are sometimes used for grid support using smaller plants.|$|R

40|$|Pre- and post-emergence weed {{harrowing}} {{were studied}} in spring cereals in different environments and with {{two types of}} harrows in Norway during 2004 – 2006. The objectives were to investigate interactions between pre and post-emergence weed harrowing {{and the importance of}} harrow type. We hypothesised that pre- and post-emergence harrowing interact positively, that a combination gives more stable weed control effects than pre- and post-emergence weed harrowing used alone, and that a <b>harrow</b> type <b>with</b> bent tines is more aggressive and suitable on hard-packed soils than a <b>harrow</b> <b>with</b> strait tines. The results only supported the last of these hypotheses. Post-emergence weed harrowing controlled a certain percentage of the present weeds, and this percentage was not dependent on pre-emergence weed harrowing. On average, pre-emergence harrowing reduced weed density by 26...|$|R
