5|$|After <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> is complete, {{the cell}} must {{physically}} {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> are particularly important.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands. Ligases are {{particularly}} important in lagging strand <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.|$|E

50|$|Incubator Shaker (or thermal shaker) can be {{considered}} a mix of an incubator and a shaker. It has an ability to shake, while maintain optimal conditions for incubating microbes or <b>DNA</b> <b>replications.</b> This equipment is very useful since in order for a cell to grow, it needs Oxygen, and nutrients, and that require shaking {{so that they can be}} distributed evenly around the culture.|$|R
5|$|The rate of <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> {{in living}} cells was first {{measured}} as {{the rate of}} phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected E. coli and found to be impressively rapid. During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37°C, the rate of elongation was 749 nucleotides per second.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> is for {{the most}} part {{extremely}} accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
50|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, DNA polymerase beta (POLB) performs base {{excision repair}} (BER) required for <b>DNA</b> maintenance, <b>replication,</b> recombination, and drug resistance.|$|R
50|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} is a {{damage tolerance}} mechanism in which specialized DNA polymerases substitute for replicative poymerases in copying across <b>DNA</b> damages during <b>replication.</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase lambda {{appears to be}} involved in translesion synthesis of abasic sites and 8-oxodG damages.|$|R
50|$|Hel308's {{principal}} role is {{to repair}} replication-blocking lesions, such as interstrand DNA cross-links that interfere with the forking of <b>DNA</b> during <b>replication.</b>|$|R
5|$|RAFA domains, or {{polymorphic}} interphase karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, {{though they were}} not thought {{to be associated with}} active <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during <b>DNA</b> <b>replication.</b> The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} to the study of molecular and cell biology as they provide simple systems {{that can be used to}} manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have been useful in the study of genetics and helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics, such as <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein transport, and immunology.|$|E

40|$|Received line The sequenced {{human and}} {{chimpanzee}} genomes allow one to investigate mutations with high rates, since the divergence {{between the two}} genomes is low. We compared the rates of transitions at CpG dinucleotides among sex chromosomes and autosomes at noncoding sequences orthologous between human and chimpanzee. We discovered that in primates the transition rates at CpG dinucleotides are lowest for chromosome X, intermediate for autosomes, and highest for Y. Thus, these mutations primarily originate in the male germline which undergoes {{a larger number of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>replications</b> compared with the female germline. This suggests that transitions at CpG dinucleotides are replicationdependent. Contact...|$|R
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after <b>DNA</b> <b>replication)</b> or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{functional}} fusion of DnaN to enhanced green fluorescent protein, {{we examined the}} subcellular localization of the replisome machinery in the vegetative mycelium and aerial mycelium of the multinucleoid organism Streptomyces coelicolor. Chromosome replication took place in many compartments of both types of hypha, with the apical compartments of the aerial mycelium exhibiting the highest replication activity. Within a single compartment, the number of “current” ongoing <b>DNA</b> <b>replications</b> was lower than the expected chromosome number, {{and the appearance of}} fluorescent foci was often heterogeneous, indicating that this process is asynchronous within compartments and that only selected chromosomes undergo replication...|$|R
50|$|CHRAC1 is a histone-fold {{protein that}} interacts with other histone-fold {{proteins}} to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner. These histone-fold protein dimers combine within larger enzymatic complexes for <b>DNA</b> transcription, <b>replication,</b> and packaging.|$|R
5000|$|Synthesis (S), {{in which}} the cell duplicates its <b>DNA</b> (via semiconservative <b>replication).</b>|$|R
5|$|In <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> and transcription.|$|E
5|$|Within {{eukaryotic}} cells DNA {{is organized}} into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated {{in the process}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>replication,</b> providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for chloroplast <b>DNA</b> (cpDNA) <b>replication</b> {{has not been}} conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led {{to the idea that}} chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the <b>DNA.</b> As <b>replication</b> continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.|$|R
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for <b>DNA</b> <b>replication.</b> Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Insects play an {{important}} role in biological research. Because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was selected as a model organism for studies of the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, animal behaviour and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like <b>DNA</b> <b>replication</b> or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the fruit fly's important role in biological research. 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the Darwinian theory of evolution from a single origin of life.|$|E
