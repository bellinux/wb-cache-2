40|$|This paper aims to {{determine}} the role of EU <b>in</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> trade flows by using the gravity model. It also aims to test whether the Customs Union (of EU) that <b>Turkey</b> entered <b>in</b> 1996 made a deviation <b>in</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> trade flows. Regional trade agreements {{on the one hand}} create new trade opportunities (trade creation effect). On the other hand, these agreements may also lead to diversion from free trade (trade diversion effect). Turkey’s Customs Union agreement without becoming a member of EU provides a laboratory to researchers to test whether the agreement was significant enough to cause any deviation <b>in</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> trade flow. <b>In</b> {{the first part of the}} study, we shortly provide some descriptive statistics related to Turkey’s trade flows with EU to see whether EU has gained any weight in the flows. In the second part, we first develop a gravity model that econometrically designates the determinants of Turkey’s trade flows via panel data approach. Next, we use this equation to test the importance of EU countries <b>in</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> trade flow and whether the flow has been subject to a deviation after the Customs Union agreement. Our findings indicate that EU countries have always been important <b>in</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> trade flow and that Customs Union has increased EU’s importance marginally <b>in</b> determining <b>Turkey’s</b> trade flow.
