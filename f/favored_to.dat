5|$|The season's fourth game saw the Commodores, <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> lose by {{two touchdowns}} against the Texas Longhorns, {{pull off a}} 20–0 upset. The game {{was the first of}} a seven-year series, from 1921 to 1928 (except 1924), between Vanderbilt and Texas at the Texas State Fair in Dallas.|$|E
5|$|Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and {{although}} he was heavily <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times {{described it as a}} smear campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{made his}} track return in Beijing but his injury had reduced his 100m medal chances and Bolt and Powell were more <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the event. The much {{anticipated}} Gay, Bolt and Powell final never materialised, however, as Gay failed to qualify in the semi-finals. Finishing fifth after recording 10.05s, Gay {{denied that he}} was still injured, but claimed the hamstring problem had upset his training schedule.|$|E

5|$|The 1931 World Series was {{a rematch}} of the {{previous}} year's participants, pitting the Cardinals against the Philadelphia Athletics. Led by Connie Mack, the Athletics had won the previous two World Series and were heavily <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win for a third consecutive year. They featured a lineup that included five future National Baseball Hall of Fame members in Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove, Waite Hoyt and Al Simmons.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} 1998 season after going 75 the {{previous}} year, including a 423 blowout loss to North Carolina in the 1998 Gator Bowl. Prior to the 1998 season, the annual preseason poll of Big East football media picked Virginia Tech to finish {{fourth in the}} Big East, and West Virginia was <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the conference. Most pre-season attention was focused on whether Tech would perform well enough to attend a sixth consecutive bowl game at the season's end.|$|E
5|$|After {{surviving}} numerous close games {{during the}} regular season, conference tournament, and most recently a triple overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the National Championship game with an unblemished record of 310. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the National Championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks part. The Kansas Jayhawks, led by Sophomore phenom and Firstteam All-American Wilt Chamberlain, came into the game <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win against the Tar Heels of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{entered the}} season as {{defending}} national champions, and began the 2010 season as the preseason number one team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. <b>Favored</b> <b>to</b> win a second consecutive SEC championship and be in contention for the national championship, the Crimson Tide opened the season with five consecutive victories over San Jose State, Penn State, Duke, Arkansas and Florida. However, Alabama completed the regular season with only nine victories and losses to South Carolina, LSU and Auburn and finished fourth in the Western Division. After the regular season, the Crimson Tide accepted an invitation {{to compete in the}} Capital One Bowl in Orlando. Against Big Ten co-champions Michigan State, Alabama won by a final score of 49–7 and captured both a third straight ten win season and top ten finish.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

At the Academy Awards, she was <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the Best Actress Oscar, but the award went to Jessica Tandy for Driving Miss Daisy {{in what was}} considered a surprise upset. The only other major acting award for which she was nominated {{that she did not}} take home for The Fabulous Baker Boys was the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, which also went to Tandy.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E
5|$|He {{kept the}} title until , {{when he was}} {{submitted}} by Hawaiian Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu specialist B.J. Penn via rear naked choke at 4:39 of the first round, in a fight he was heavily <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win. The title was vacated upon a contract dispute between Penn and UFC who promptly stripped him of the welterweight title, claiming Penn had breached his contract and that the signing constituted him refusing to defend his title. Penn filed suit against UFC and publicized {{his side of the}} conflict, claiming his contract had expired. Penn filed a motion to stop UFC from awarding a new welterweight title, but that motion was denied.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{experienced}} one of {{his worst}} performances in his international career against England in Munich in 2001. Germany were <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win as they had beaten England 1–0 in 2000 at the Wembley Stadium. However, they were routed 5–1, including a hat-trick by Michael Owen. Despite the defeat, Germany qualified for the World Cup after winning a playoff against Ukraine, and Kahn remained as Germany's number one for the upcoming Cup. Kahn was named the best goalkeeper {{in the world by}} IFFHS {{for the second time in}} his career.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{was heavily}} <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the contest, {{as the point}} spread favored Nebraska by 16 points to 17 points. Heading into the Orange Bowl, the two teams {{presented}} a study in contrasts. The Cornhuskers boasted a string of 28 seasons with nine or more victories, received 28 straight bowl bids, spent 256 consecutive weeks ranked in the AP poll, and had recorded 214 straight sellouts in their 75,000-capacity home stadium. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, had a bowl streak dating back just three years, to the 1993 Independence Bowl, and while the game was Nebraska's 16th Orange Bowl, it was Virginia Tech's first. Nebraska and Virginia Tech were among the winningest seven teams in Division I-A college football during the two seasons prior to the Orange Bowl. Virginia Tech had 20 wins in those two seasons, while Nebraska had 22 victories.|$|E
5|$|No. 19 Virginia Tech {{earned a}} bid to the 2009 Orange Bowl via an {{automatic}} bid, courtesy of a 30–12 victory against Boston College in the 2008 ACC Championship Game that saw the Hokies named champions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The game was played on January 1, 2009, and also featured the No. 12 Cincinnati Bearcats, champions of the Big East Conference. Pregame {{media coverage of the}} game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history, and despite their bowl-game inexperience, the Bearcats were <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win by two and a half points on the eve of the game.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, 1896, Earp was {{a last-minute}} choice as referee for a boxing match that the {{promoters}} {{billed as the}} heavyweight championship of the world. Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.|$|E

5|$|The Florida State/Virginia Tech matchup was the 31st {{game between}} the two teams since they first met in 1955. At the time, Florida State held the {{advantage}} in wins, with a 19101 record against Virginia Tech. Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl, however, spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win by two points on Dec. 10. This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles, who hadn't finished out of {{first place in the}} ACC since joining the league in 1992, and would not participate in the national championship game {{for the first time in}} four years. Because of this decline in stature, the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage than it would have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> run in the Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire {{and ran for the}} Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Gianni Bugno.

According to Paolo Viberti of El País, Bugno came in as the odds on favorite to win the race. Eugenio Capodacqua of La Repubblica and La Stampas Gianni Ranieri believed that the race was going be won by either Chiappucci or Bugno. Despite being <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> win the race, Bugno entered the race with no victories to his name that season. American Greg LeMond told the press he planned to be more competitive at this Giro than he had in years past. Other favorites to win the race were Laurent Fignon, Pedro Delgado, and Marino Lejarreta.|$|E
