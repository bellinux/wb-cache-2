Built by the Joint Venture consisting of Flatiron Structures (Longmont, Co.), FCI Constructors (Benicia, Ca.), and Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company of Darlington, England, it consists of the south anchorage, a transition pier, two towers (South and North towers), and the north anchorage. The towers are each founded on two footings, which are each supported by six vertical, 3 m steel shells infilled with reinforced concrete, followed by 2.7 m drilled shafts in rock (i.e., cast-in-drilled hole, or CIDH, piles). The total length of the CIDH pile at the South Tower is approximately 89 m, with about 43 m of <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> in rock.
