5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> shallower non-polar waters.|$|E

Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E

5|$|Cooking styles vary {{by region}} and {{each type of}} cooking style and the {{ingredients}} used are generally based on the climate and location of the particular region and on traditions. Rice and variations of kibbee are common in the Galilee. The West Bank engages primarily in heavier meals involving the use of taboon bread, rice and meat and coastal plain inhabitants frequent fish, other seafood, and lentils. The Gaza cuisine is {{a variation of the}} Levant cuisine, but is more <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too. Meals are usually eaten in the household but dining out has become prominent particularly during parties where light meals like salads, bread dips and skewered meats are served.|$|E
5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Many solitary wasps are parasitoids. As adults, {{those that}} do feed {{typically}} only take nectar from flowers. Parasitoid wasps are extremely <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon {{the outside of the}} host. The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae pupate or emerge as adults.|$|E

This area of Ivalice is <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> both {{geography}} and climate, ranging from the hilly, clement grasslands of southern Valendia to the deserts of Dalmasca. In Kerwon, south of Dalmasca, the lands are arid at lower altitudes, though the higher elevations are the only places in the region known to receive snow. The north of Kerwon is heavily forested, home to the dense Golmore Jungle, within which lies the magical Feywood.|$|E

5|$|Wildlife in pine rockland {{communities}} is <b>diverse.</b> <b>In</b> some forests, 15species of birds can be found. Common {{among them are}} the pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), the red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). More than 20species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern black racer (Coluber constrictor priapus). Mammals such as the critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), American black bearFlorida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{has been}} criticized and {{sometimes}} derided for its lack of diversity and multicultural offerings, but the city has become more <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> recent decades. People from countries in the former Soviet Union (especially Russians and Ukrainians) form a comparatively large demographic in Spokane and Spokane County, {{the result of a}} large influx of immigrants and their families {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991. According to the 2000 Census, the number of people of Russian or Ukrainian ancestry in Spokane County was reported to be 7,700 (4,900 residing in the city of Spokane), amounting to two percent of the county. Among the fastest-growing demographics in Spokane is the Pacific Islander ethnic group, which is estimated to be the third largest minority group in the county, after the Russian and Ukrainian community and Latinos. Spokane was once home to a sizable Asian community, mostly Japanese, centered in a district called Chinatown from the early days of the city until 1974. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads. The Chinatown Asian community thrived until the 1940s, after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed, losing its Asian character; urban blight and the preparations leading up to Expo '74 led to Chinatown's eventual demolition.|$|E

5|$|The area {{is now one}} of {{the most}} ethnically and {{economically}} <b>diverse</b> <b>in</b> Louisville. Crime is becoming less of a problem. While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city of Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts of Louisville. The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion of Louisville beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, with one or two per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.|$|E
