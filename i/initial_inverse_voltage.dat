These loads introduce a destabilizing nonlinear {{effect on the}} con-verter through an <b>inverse</b> <b>voltage</b> term that leads to significant os-cillations in the main bus voltage or its collapse. Converter dynam-ics are analyzed in both switching states and the various operating regions of switch interaction with a first-order switching surface (boundary) are identified. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for large-signal stability of the closed-loop system are established. The analysis indicates that a linear switching surface with a negative slope passing through the desired operation point yields a stable operation. It is also shown that instability as well as system-stalling, which we term the invariant-set problem, may still occur in reflec-tive mode.
