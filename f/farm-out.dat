40|$|We take {{a simple}} {{tutorial}} approach {{to explain how}} option valuation can be applied in practice to the petroleum industry. We discuss a simple spreadsheet formulation, demonstrate how required input data can be extracted from market information, and give several exploration and development examples. Under the market and fiscal conditions described we derive the value of discovered, undeveloped reserves projected to result from offshore licensing in the United Kingdom, and we show how to determine the maximum amount that should be committed to an exploration work program to find those reserves. Lease-bidding and <b>farm-out</b> applications are briefly described. We recommend option valuation {{as an alternative to}} discounted cash flow analysis in situations where cash flows are uncertain and management has operating flexibility to adjust investment during the life of the project, and point to further work needed to fully value nested or embedded options. ...|$|E

40|$|Nestor John Sander (December 5, 1914 - February 11, 2012), "Sandy" for his friends, was {{a living}} history book, {{describing}} himself as a positivist. Nestor was born {{and grew up in}} Oakland, California. In 1932, after graduating from high school, he moved on to the University of California at Berkeley where he earned a Bachelor degree in 1936, followed by a Masters degree in Paleontology in 1938. That same year he joined the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), an affiliate of the Standard Oil of California (SOCAL, today's Chevron Corporation), which later (in 1944) became the Arabian American Oil Company, that is ARAMCO. Nestor was sent as a junior geologist for his first assignment to Saudi Arabia. That was before World War II started and much before the country became known as the major worldwide oil producer. There he probably gained his nickname and entered into the history of petroleum exploration, for he was given responsibility for the delineation of the Abqaiq field, which led to Ghawar, that was to become the world's largest oilfield: Sander's name will remain associated with those of pioneering explorationists in the Middle East, including "Dick" Bramkamp (Sander, 1959), Robert G. S. Hudson, "Mike" Morton (Dunnington et al., 1959; Q. M. Morton, 2006), R. W. Powers (1968), Max Steineke (Steineke et al., 1958), W. Sugden (Sugden & Stranding, 1975), René Wetzel (Dunnington et al., 1959), [...] . They are now almost forgotten for -with few notable exceptions- most of their work remains unpublished, being proprietary reports archived at their employers' headquarters. In 1941 Nestor joined the American army and was assigned to intelligence services in Northern Africa and Europe because he could speak and read French (as well as German, Italian and Spanish). In Paris, he met Georgette Cordin, and they were married in 1946. Later the same year, Nestor was back in Saudi Arabia, followed by "Georgia" a few months later. They lived in Dhahran until late 1951 when he was given new responsibilities which led them to move to New York. On their way back to America, they stopped in Paris for a three-month long leave. During this short entr'acte Nestor completed the writing and editing of the manuscript of his D. Sc. thesis and defended it publicly in front of a jury presided by Professor Jean Cuvillier in Sorbonne University in early 1952 (an abridged version in French was published in 1962 : an unpublished English version of this early work will be available soon in Carnets de Géologie). In 1955 Nestor resigned from ARAMCO and joined CONORADA Petroleum Corporation, a consortium created by Amerada Petroleum Corporation (today's Amerada Hess Corporation), Continental Oil Company (today's ConocoPhillips) and Ohio Oil Company (today's Marathon Oil Corporation), in charge of petroleum exploration outside the United States and Canada. In order to evaluate open acreage and screen <b>farm-out</b> offers, he travelled a lot (Europe, Central and South America, Africa, India, the Middle East). In 1963 he joined the American International Oil Company, a subsidiary of Standard Oil Company [Indiana] (later merged with BP). Still in charge of evaluation, he was sharing information with William E. Humphrey, the Vice-President Exploration at AIOC (Sander & Humphrey, 1965; Sander et al., 1975) and Colin Campbell, who became a prominent "Peak Oil" man (and the editor of a book with a chapter dedicated to Nestor: see Sander, 2011). In 1967 Nestor published a practical classification of carbonate rocks which he first implemented while working in Saudi Arabia (and an early version of which was first exposed by Bramkamp & Powers, 1962) : unfortunately his classification came up too late after those of Folk (1959) and Dunham (1962). In 1977 the couple moved to Spain to enjoy retirement in the neighborhood of Madrid until Georgia's death in early 1992. To occupy his mind Nestor left Spain, travelled in Western Europe and started writing a manuscript entitled "Ibn Saud - King by conquest" (published in 2002). In 1994, he returned to California and decided to settle in Modesto. Thanks {{to the development of the}} internet, he managed to keep abreast of modern developments in geology: we first met on the World Wide Web, but he was 87 years old when I met him in person in Paris. He then started a new "career" as a scientific writer when I invited him to contribute to some projects (Granier et al., 2006, 2009; Grosheny et al., 2011; Granier & Sander, 2012). On YouTube™, the "rednasrotsen's channel" (his name spelt right to left) includes a number of didactic videos he edited (17 of them are dedicated to stratigraphy and paleontology) : his last months were dedicated to mounting a video dealing with the world of the Gastropods. Last but not least, Nestor Sander was one of the founders of Carnets de Géologie: many non-native English speakers will remember him as a very kind and generous person who, for instance, helped them polish their manuscripts. We shall miss him...|$|E
