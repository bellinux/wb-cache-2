40|$|Lightning {{has long}} been {{postulated}} as the agent of Chondru|e formation in the solar nebula, but it may have an additional role to play as well. Lightning bolts of almost any scale will both vaporize dust and liberate oxygen atoms that will then interact with both nebular gases {{as well as the}} refractory silicate vapor as it re-condenses. Such processes should result in the addition of the heavy oxygen isotopes to the growing silicate grains while the light oxygen- 16 becomes part of the gas phase water. This process will proceed to some extent throughout the history of any turbulent nebula and will result in the gradual increase of O- 16 in the gas phase and in a much larger relative increase in the O- 17 and O- 18 content of the nebular dust. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated the production of such "heavy oxygen enriched", non-mass-dependently-fractionated dust grains in a high voltage discharge in a hydrogen rich gas containing small quantities of silane, <b>pentacarbonyl</b> <b>iron</b> and oxygen...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{optimization}} {{of the composition}} phosphate binders. These binders are used in production of refractories. In this branch, the bauxite is very often used as an aggregate, but it contains tiny particles of iron which arise in milling process. These particles of iron react with the phosphate binder to form hydrogen – it is consequence of the reaction between phosphoric acid and iron. The formed gas causes the formation of bubbles and the deformation of refractories. The goal of this thesis is to find suitable additives {{which can be used}} to stop or to limit the production of hydrogen. Usually used binders were replaced by a model binder to simplify the system and for better understanding. The model binder was prepared in laboratory by dissolving aluminium hydroxide in phosphoric acid. They used pure powdered <b>pentacarbonyl</b> <b>iron</b> instead of tiny iron particles from the milling process. The model binder was modified with using a few inhibitors.

40|$|Abstract. Synthesis {{of carbon}} nanofibers from V-type {{pyrolysis}} flame {{is a novel}} method. It needs simple laboratory equipments and normal atmosphere pressure. The V-type pyrolysis flame experimental system is introduced. Carbon source is the carbon monoxide and heat source is from acetylene/air premixed flame. <b>Pentacarbonyl</b> <b>iron</b> is served as catalyst. The carbon nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. This study aims to examine temperature condition for carbon nanofibers formation in pyrolysis flame and to characterize its morphology and structure. The carbon nanofibers with less impurity were captured successfully in the V-type pyrolysis flame. The diameter of carbon nanofibers was approximate between 100 nm and 200 nm, and its length was dozens of microns. When the temperature was below 750 °C, the growth of carbon nanofibers came into the preparation growth period. The length of the carbon nanofibers increased gradually and the diameter had no obvious change with the raising of temperature. When the temperature was above 750 °C, the growth of carbon nanofibers came into the exuberant growth period. The growth of carbon nanofibers was finished when the temperature was above 820 °C. Higher temperature was meaningless after the carbon nanofibers formation. The contrast experiments show {{that it is the}} most favorable to form carbon nanofibers when the temperature is from 750 to 850 °C...|$|R

In the following chapter,rnwe study the synthesis of these monodiperse nanoparticles with the similar <b>iron</b> precursorrn(iron <b>pentacarbonyl)</b> and different transition metal precursors such as metalrnacetate/acetylacetonate/formate precursors in the presence of various surfactants and solvents. rnAccording to their decomposition temperatures and reducing condition, a specific and suitablernroute was designed for the formation of Metal@Metal oxide or MFe 2 O 4 nanoparticlesrn(Metal/M=transition metal). rnOne of the key purposes in the formation of nanocrystals is the development of syntheticrnpathways for designing and controlling the composition, shape and size of predictedrnnanostructures. The ability to arrange different nanosized domains of metallic and magneticrnmaterials into a single heterodimer nanostructure offers an interesting direction to engineerrnthem with multiple functionalities or enhanced properties of one domain. The presence andrnrole of surfactants and solvents in these reactions result in a variety of nanocrystal shapes. Therncrystalline phase, the growth rate and the orientation of growth parameters along certainrndirections of these structures can be chemically modulated by using suitable surfactants. In allrnnovel reported heterodimer nanostructures in this thesis, initially metals were preformed andrnthen by the injection of iron precursor in appropriate temperature, iron oxide nanoparticlesrnwere started to nucleate on the top or over the surfaces of metal nanoparticles. Ternary phasesrnof spherical CuxFe 3 -xO 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 ferrites nanoparticles were designed to synthesis just byrnlittle difference in diffusion step with the formation of mentioned phase separated heterodimerrnnanoparticles. In order to use these magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical and catalysisrnapplications, they should be transferred into the water phase solution, therefore they werernfunctionalized by a multifunctional polymeric ligand. These functionalized nanoparticles werernstable against aggregation and precipitation in aqueous media for a long time. Magneticrnresonance imaging and catalytic reactivities are two promising applications which have beenrnutilized for these magnetic nanoparticles in this thesis. rnThis synthetic method explained in the following chapters can be extended to the synthesis ofrnother heterostructured nanomaterials such as Ni@MnO or M@M@iron oxide (M=transitionrnmetal) or to use these multidomain particles as building blocks for higher order structures...|$|R

40|$|Lightning in the Solar Nebula {{is caused}} by the tribo-electric {{charging}} of dust grains carried by massive turbulent flows and driven by the accretion energy in the disk: it has long been one agent assumed responsible for the formation of chondrules. The degree to which charge separation can occur is dependent upon a number of factors, including the concentration of radioactive sources and the total level of ionization in the nebula, and these factors determine the maximum energy likely to be released by a single bolt. While chondrule formation requires a massive discharge, even a small lightning bolt can vaporize grains in the ionized discharge channel. Experimental studies have shown that silica, iron silicate and iron oxide grains formed from a high voltage discharge in hydrogen rich gas containing some oxygen produces solids that are enriched in O- 17 and O- 18 relative to the composition of the starting gas. Vaporization of silicates produces SiO, metal and free oxygen atoms in each discharge and these species will immediately begin to recondense from the hot plasma. Freshly condensed grains are incrementally enriched in heavy oxygen while the gas is enriched in O- 16. Repeated evaporation and condensation of silicates in continuously occurring lightning discharges will monotonically increase the fractionation of oxygen isotopes between the O- 17 and O- 18 rich dust and the O- 16 rich gas. The first mass independently fractionated refractory oxide particles were produced in the lab following the condensation of a flowing gas mixture containing variable amounts of hydrogen, silane, <b>pentacarbonyl</b> <b>iron</b> and oxygen that passed through a high voltage discharge powered by a Tesla coil. While the exact chemical pathway is still uncertain, the most probable reaction mechanisms involve oxidation of the growing refractory clusters by O 3, OH or O atoms. This model has some interesting consequences for chemical processes in the early solar nebula. Chemical fractionation of recondensed dust evaporated via lightning discharges should be strongly time dependent. At earlier times, the accretion rate is maximal, thus driving strong turbulence, energetic grain-grain collisions, tribo-electric charging and charge separation, leading to frequent, powerful lightning discharges. As the accretion rate diminishes, turbulence decreases and lightning discharges will become both less powerful and less frequent, thus decreasing the rate of dust-gas fractionation. The most rapid increase in the formation of O- 16 poor dust will occur early in nebular history. Generation of fractionated dust should be distributed throughout the inner disk. Once condensed, grain dispersal would average out any significant isotopic anomalies within the inner disk...|$|R
