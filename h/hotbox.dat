5000|$|Historically, cold frames {{were built}} {{to be used}} in {{addition}} to a heated greenhouse. The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the warm greenhouse and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse's foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be [...] "hardened-off" [...] before final planting outside. Cold frames are similar to some enclosed hotbeds, also called <b>hotboxes.</b> The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called [...] "hothouses" [...] to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a heater or HVAC system of some kind.|$|R
50|$|Chris Rest was a {{founding}} member of hardcore punk band Rich Kids on LSD (RKL) when they formed in 1982. He remained the only consistent throughout the band's entire career. Through their influential career spanning three decades RKL released four full-length studio albums and one live album. RKL went on hiatus in 1995. In 1996 Rest formed a band called The Other with RKL's Bomer Manzullo and drummer Boz Rivera. This group produced one self-titled album released in 1997 on Honest Don's Records, a subsidiary label set up by Fat Wreck Chords to release material by bands that didn't fit within the roster at Fat. That same year Rest played guitar on Buck Wild's album Beat Me Silly. In 1997 Rest replaced guitarist Ken Stringfellow as a member of Lagwagon. Rest has appeared on all subsequent Lagwagon releases. Rest also contributed his guitar on Mad Caddies 2001 release Rock the Plank, and <b>Hotbox's</b> 2001 release Lickety Split.|$|R

500|$|The {{special train}} {{consisted}} of three passenger cars pulled by one locomotive. [...] The three cars used were baggage car #210, dining car #1407, and Pullman Muskegon. [...] Altogether, the three cars weighed a total of 170short tons (155metric tons). [...] While the three cars remained constant throughout {{the run of the}} Scott Special, the locomotive did not. [...] In order to prevent delays on the trip as the train would need to stop for water and fuel, nineteen locomotives were prepared along the route so that as one reached the end of its supplies, it would relay the three cars off to the next fully fueled and ready locomotive to continue the run. [...] For the more strenuous grades over Cajon Pass in California and Raton Pass in New Mexico and Colorado, helpers were added to get the train up and over the summits. [...] At various points throughout the run, problems such as <b>hotboxes</b> did occur, or in one instance a complete mechanical failure of the locomotive, but in each case, the train's crew was able to get the train to the next relay point, and they usually arrived ahead of schedule.|$|R
5000|$|In {{preparation}} for the writing and recording of the album, Wilson purchased about two thousand dollars worth of marijuana and hashish. In addition, Wilson famously installed a <b>hotboxing</b> tent in his home and relocated a grand piano to a sandbox in his living room. Between April and September 1966, Wilson and Parks spent many [...] "all night sessions" [...] co-writing a number of songs in the sandbox. Wilson wanted the approval of {{what was called the}} [...] "hip intelligentsia", in other words, the counterculture tastemakers. Parks remembered: [...] "Brian sought me out ... At that time, people who experimented with psychedelics—no matter who they were—were viewed as enlightened people, and Brian sought out the enlightened people." [...] A surrounding coterie eventually formed for most of the Smile sessions. This group included Derek Taylor, Paul Williams, Loren Schwartz, Danny Hutton, Jules Siegel, David Anderle, Michael Vosse, and Paul Jay Robbins. Anderle, a talent manager informally known as the [...] "mayor of hip", was the most notable, and became a business partner to the Beach Boys, persuading the band to establish the independent Brother Records label and litigate against Capitol for neglected royalties.|$|R

5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{automated}} detectors, it was the responsibility of on-board train crew and track-side workers to visually inspect trains for defects, and then to bring the train to a halt, if a defect were observed. To detect [...] "hotboxes," [...] i.e., overheating bearings, they would look for oil smoke during the day or a red glow at night. As early as the 1940s, automatic defect detectors were installed to improve upon the manual process. <b>Hotboxes</b> could be detected using new infrared light sensors; high and wide loads by wires outlining the clearance envelope, and dragging equipment through [...] "brittle bars" [...] - frangible bars mounted between the rails. The detectors would transmit their data via wired links to remote read-outs in stations, offices or interlocking towers. A stylus-and-cylinder gauge would record a reading for every axle; if a journal were too hot, or if some other defect were detected, the offending axle would register a sharp spike on the graph. An alarm would sound as well, and the employee on duty at that locality would either use manual signals or the signaling system to bring the train to a halt and, if possible, to inform {{the crew of the}} approximate location of the problem.|$|R

5000|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad {{used her}} voice talent {{contained}} inside Harmon Electronics (of Grain Valley, MO) track-side defect detector devices, used in various locations {{west of the}} Mississippi River. When a defect is identified on the passing train, the system responds with her recorded voice announcing the defect location information to the train crew over the radio. In railroad forums and railroad radio monitoring groups, she was and is still {{referred to as the}} [...] "SP Lady". However, with the implementation of newer <b>hotbox</b> detector technology, finding her voice today on working detectors is very rare. The <b>hotbox</b> detectors that had her voice installed in them were not upgradeable to the newer digital signaling requirements, and finding parts for them was problematic. Today, her voice is found on smaller regional railroads, usually only at dragging equipment locations, such as in California at milepost 24.6 on the Metrolink Lancaster line (under the I-5 and I-210 interchange in Sylmar), and in Oregon on the Portland & Western at milepost 746.5, near Lake Oswego. These voiced detectors remain because the lines were once owned by Southern Pacific, and because only two unchanging recorded messages are used, compared to the dynamic changing library used in <b>hotbox</b> detectors. The only major railroad that still uses her voice today is Union Pacific.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase first {{appeared}} in James Weldon Johnson's poem [...] "The Prodigal Son," [...] {{which was published in}} his 1927 book of poems God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse. The passage — which refers to an arm singular rather than arms plural — reads: Young man—Young man—Your arm's too short to box with God.But Jesus spake in a parable, and he said:A certain man had two sons.Jesus didn't give this man a name,But his name is God Almighty.And Jesus didn't call these sons by name,But ev'ry young man,Ev'rywhere,Is one of these two sons. The title phrase has been used in other contexts. [...] "Your lungs is too small to <b>hotbox</b> with God" [...] is a line used by rapper Xzibit in Eminem's [...] "Bitch Please 2". Xzibit later used a variation of the line ("Your little lungs is too weak to <b>hotbox</b> with God") on [...] "Down for the Count" [...] by Reflection Eternal. The phrase also appears in the Black Star song [...] "Thieves in the Night", in the line [...] "Your firearms are too short to box with God". GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan also used a variation ("Rhymes too short to box with God") on his track [...] "Paper Plates" [...] from Pro Tools. Killah Priest, also of Wu-Tang Clan, opened his hip-hop album, Heavy Mental, with it. It is in [...] "It's All Real" [...] by Pitch Black and [...] "Mortal Combat" [...] by Big Daddy Kane.

5000|$|Blacktop cookies - Chunks {{of virgin}} uncompacted {{hot mix asphalt}} {{which can be used}} for pothole repair. The use of {{blacktop}} cookies has been investigated as a less expensive, less labor-intensive, more durable alternative to repairing potholes with cold patch. In a program in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, workers purchased new hot mix asphalt and spread it liberally on the ground to produce approximately 25 lb. wafers. Once cooled, the wafers could be stored until reheated in a <b>hotbox</b> to make minor road repairs. Blacktop cookies may also be produced from leftover material from paving jobs.|$|E

50|$|Seaboard Air Line was {{the first}} {{railroad}} to install talking defect detectors. Beginning in the 1960s, their train crews could hear the results of <b>hotbox</b> and dragging-equipment checks spoken over their radios in the engine cab and in the caboose. Over the years, {{as the use of}} this technology accelerated, the rear-end crews were eliminated from most freight trains. For example, computerized, talking detectors allowed crews to interact with the detector using a touch tone function on their radios to recall the latest defect report. This eliminated any need for crews to walk to the detector location to confirm the radio reading.|$|E
