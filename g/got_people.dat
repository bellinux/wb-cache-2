The Oamaru club played many outside matches in their first years including matches against Australia and England. In 1892 the Waitaki Cricket Association was formed to regulate and manage cricket in the Ashburton, South Canterbury and North Otago areas, however this {{did not last long}} because {{there was no way to}} maintain unity, and it had been impossible to establish a club competition. It was a match against South Canterbury in 1896 that <b>got</b> <b>people</b> interested in forming another cricket association in the area, and in 1899 the North Otago Cricket Association was formed.|$|E

DJs and liners attacked the competition {{as well as}} artists such as Michael Bolton and Barry Manilow.

People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that <b>got</b> <b>people</b> moving, as well as the music.|$|E

Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't surprise me. When you have <b>got</b> <b>people</b> in your own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place.
