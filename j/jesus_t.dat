On February 19, 1946 New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez and del Valle held a meeting with President Harry S. Truman in the White House, in which Chavez recommended del Valle for the position of governor of Puerto Rico. From 1898 to 1942, the governors of the island were officials appointed by the President of the United States. Local Puerto Rican politicians, such as Luis Muñoz Marín, opposed the naming of del Valle in favor of <b>Jesús</b> <b>T.</b> Piñero; to which del Valle eventually asked President Truman to withdraw his name among those considered for the position. The first civilian and native Puerto Rican appointed governor of Puerto Rico thus became Piñero in 1946. If Congress had not approved legislation in 1947 allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor, del Valle may have been appointed to the governorship.|$|E

Four hundred and ninety lactating females were used and assigned to eight groups: I-OvSynch, n= 68, with selection of cycling cows; II-OvSynch + progesterone (P- 4), n= 67, after selection of non-cycling animals; III-OvSynch, without selection, n= 68; IV-OvSynch + P- 4, without selection, n= 67; V-Co-Synch, n= 55, with selection of cycling cows; VI-Co-Synch + P- 4, n= 55, with selection non-cycling cows; VII- Co-Synch without selection, n= 55; VIII- Co-Synch + P- 4, without selection, n= 55. The conception and pregnancy rates were, respectively, 45. 6 %, 27. 9 % and 82. 4 %, 48. 5 % for groups I and III; 61. 2 %, 37. 3 % and 85. 1 %, 58. 2 % for groups II and IV; 43. 6 %, 25. 5 % and 80 %, 41. 8 % for groups V and VII; 52. 7 %, 32. 7 % and 83. 6 %, 50. 9 % for groups VI and VIII. When compared these rates, the results after chi-square test showed significant difference (P 0. 05) between OvSynch and Co-Synch protocols, with or without P- 4 and with selection, considering Co-Synch a viable option for optimization of FTAI.
