40|$|I {{undertake}} a discourse analysis of World Bank documents from 1995 {{to the present}} to explore scholarly debates surrounding the question, “To what extent are the World Bank’s efforts to combat corruption evidence of its attempts to further the neoliberal agenda, characterized by the original Washington Consensus?” Since the late 1990 ’s, the World Bank {{has been a leader}} in the fight against corruption, integrating anti-corruption into its operations worldwide and making it a major issue addressed in World Development Reports, Presidential speeches, and specific anti-corruption strategies. While some scholars see this as an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>move</b> away from neoliberalism, others see the focus on corruption as a way for the Bank to continue to advance and expand the neoliberal agenda after the failure of structural adjustment programs. I argue that while the World Bank’s anti-corruption strategy featured distinctly neoliberal ideals in its early years, over time it has moved away from a focus on liberalization and competition to a more holistic focus on transparency and civic participation as pillars of good governance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: In this dissertation, {{the author}} has {{undertaken}} research involving the executive of the United Firefighters’ Union - Queensland Branch (UFUQ) to develop a practical definition and application for the emerging concept of ‘human security’ and its potential application {{to the needs of}} the Union and its membership. The central research questions start by considering the Australian trade union movement’s focus on ‘job security’, before asking whether ‘human security’ represents an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>move</b> that is worthy of their consideration. Subsequent questions examine the Federal Government’s view of globalisation, as a ‘top-down’ approach, and the relationship between trade, security, and ‘the national interest’, before considering the merits of constructing a ‘bottom-up’ approach from the base of civil society, through bodies such as unions. Human security, as a recent addition to security thinking, seeks to empower ‘ordinary’ people as active actors in their quest for ‘real’ security, as they seek freedom from both ‘fear’ and ‘want’. This reverses the Realist tradition that demands security be derived ‘from above’, organised within the realm of sovereign states as they fulfil their task of protecting ‘the national interest’. Emerging post-Cold War, human security has been used to argue that the Realist approach to security, involving balance-of-power mechanisms, may be usurped by a more holistic approach. One that invests people as central actors rather than states, favouring individuals above the territorial entities they inhabit. The current phase of globalisation poses various challenges to states’ security, as the physical bordersecurity erodes through technological advance, and new modes of business. The proposed Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) carries both potential benefits and disruptions to the lives of ordinary Australians. But, the debate is unbalanced, largely flowing downwards from the international sphere to individuals below. Alternatives generated within civil society struggle for legitimacy, failing the dominant ‘commonsense’ paradigm, as the current hegemony ensures that the most powerful tools in the ‘toolbox of power’ are held firmly in the grip of those better positioned to dictate policies. The search for a new definition of human security faltered, as research revealed a lower level of awareness in issues further removed from the firefighter’s control. From this finding emerged a web-based self-education research tool, and later, a simple pictorial tool, the ‘Orbits of Security’. Both instruments were inspired by Gramsci’s notion of ‘cultural hegemony’. Both are intended to show the UFUQ membership how, through education, they can begin to assert greater ownership over their personal human security ‘orbit’ by comprehending the nature of ‘cultural hegemony’. The study concludes by arguing that the rightful place of ‘ordinary people’ is at society’s core, not at the periphery. In this way, ‘human security’ becomes a useful counter-hegemonic tool for the UFUQ, and a valuable addition to their ‘toolbox of power’...|$|E
50|$|Not {{only has}} life evolved, but life has evolved to evolve. That is, {{correlations}} within protein structure have evolved, and mechanisms to manipulate these correlations have evolved in tandem. The rates {{at which the}} various events within the hierarchy of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>moves</b> occur are not random or arbitrary but are selected by Darwinian evolution. Sensibly, rapid or extreme environmental change leads to selection for greater evolvability. This selection is not forbidden by causality and is strongest on the largest-scale moves within the mutational hierarchy. Many observations within evolutionary biology, heretofore considered evolutionary happenstance or accidents, are explained by selection for evolvability. For example, the vertebrate immune system shows that the variable environment of antigens has provided selective pressure {{for the use of}} adaptable codons and low-fidelity polymerases during somatic hypermutation. A similar driving force for biased codon usage as a result of productively high mutation rates is observed in the hemagglutinin protein of influenza A.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the evolution of}} impatience, focusing on one-person decision problems, finds that evolutionary forces favor the more patient individuals. This paper shows that {{in the context of a}} game, this is not necessarily the case. In particular, it offers a twopopulation example where evolutionary forces favor impatience in one group while favoring patience in the other. Moreover, not only evolution but also efficiency may prefer impatient individuals. In our example, it is efficient for one population to evolve impatience and for the other to develop patience. Yet, <b>evolutionary</b> forces <b>move</b> the wrong populations. 1 We thank Fernando Vega-Redondo, Ramon Marimon and participants at the EUI Microeconomics working group for helpful comments.

For instance, if a tree has a mutation making it taller, it will have an advantage due to more sunlight. But as soon as other trees reach the same height, it loses that advantage. As soon as a taller tree appears, it has the advantage. In this example, the nearest peak of the <b>evolutionary</b> landscape <b>moves</b> as the population approaches it. Another example of runaway evolution in sexual selection is an elk's antlers. Having big antlers makes a male elk more likely to win a mate. In fact, having big antlers is a requirement to mate. As a result, elk evolve antlers that are incredibly costly to build, maintain, and fight with. By {{the end of the}} mating season, the average male loses 25% of his body weight [...] due to fighting, which he has to make up before winter starts.|$|R

More generally, behavior is often the source of context dependence; behavioral responses in different conditions lead to different ecological outcomes. As community ecology is broadening to include behavior, behavioral ecologists can begin to incorporate ecological perspectives in asking evolutionary questions.

40|$|The {{computation}} {{of a good}} approximation set of the Pareto {{front of}} a multiobjective optimization problem can be recasted as the maximization of its S-metric value. A high-precision method for computing approximation sets of a Pareto front with maximal S-Metric is {{presented in this paper}} as a high-level relay hybrid of an evolutionary algorithm and a gradient method, both guided by the S-metric.

The gradient-based method takes this population as its starting point for computing a local maximal approximation set with respect to the S-metric. As opposed to existing work on gradient-based multicriteria optimization in the new gradient approach we compute gradients based on a set of points rather than for single points. We will term this approach indicatorbased gradient method, and exemplify it for the S-metric. We derive expressions for computing the gradient of a set of points with respec...|$|R

As managers usually tend to favour short term and low risk projects, such a product family {{is not likely to}} be engineered as a product line. However, we can engineer different evolutionary paths of a product that are uncertain but have high potential of revenue growth as a product line also. One would start with developing common aspects of possible <b>evolutionary</b> paths and <b>move</b> on with variabilities while uncertainty is resolved. Because of time-to-market advantages the inherent flexibility of the resulting architecture can have great value for an organization and therefore justify a product line approach. In this context variabilities are considered as options that give you the right but not the obligation to evolve the product in one of several possible directions. This paper introduces the basic idea of Strategic Product Line Engineering and gives an outlook on how option-pricing theory might be applied to estimate the value of strategic product lines...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolutionary}} landscapes changed once more {{as we entered}} the era of molecular evolution. It is claimed Maynard Smith (1970) {{is the first to}} visualize protein evolution as a network of proteins one mutational step away from others. However, for this to be true, there must be pathways between functional proteins. Acknowledging the work of Kimura, King, and Jukes (the neutral theory of molecular evolution), Maynard Smith realized the proteins along such pathways could have equal functionality or be neutral. In other words, not all moves in evolution are [...] "uphill." [...] In 1984, Gillespie adapted the concept of evolutionary landscapes to nucleotide sequences and so visualized the [...] "mutational landscape" [...] whereby all nucleotide sequences are one mutational step away from another, which is remarkably similar and yet fundamentally different from Wright's original concept. This conceptual shift, along with the development of vast computational power, has allowed <b>evolutionary</b> landscapes to <b>move</b> from being a simple visual metaphor to a working model of evolution.

While all these authors either failed to cite, or incorrectly cited, Peirce, I show that Thagard has noted a sense in which Peirce’s early work provides a precursor to the modern notion of inference to the best explanation. However, a careful reading of Peirce shows that “abduction ” has never been a proper synonym for “inference to the best explanation. ” So Peirce is not to blame for the misunderstanding. I conclude by defending the philosophic importance of abduction and demonstrating how applying Peirce’s criteria for good abduction to debates in <b>evolutionary</b> theory can <b>move</b> the field forward. 1...|$|R

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GPS-Squitter is a technology for aircraft surveillance in which aircraft broadcast their GPSdetermined positions to all listeners via the Mode S data link. It can be used to provide aircraft traffic displays, on the ground for controllers and in the cockpit for pilots. It is compatible with existing ground-based beacon interrogator radars and is an <b>evolutionary</b> way to <b>move</b> from ground-radar surveillance to Automatic Dependent Surveillance. During a July 1994 meeting, the FAA requested that MIT Lincoln Laboratory conduct a demonstration of GPS-Squitter in the Gulf of Mexico. Shortly thereafter, in November-December 1994, a field evaluation of GPS-Squitter for air surveillance was held in the Gulf. Objectives of this evaluation were to determine the suitability of GPS-Squitter for air surveillance in general, and more specifically for air surveillance of helicopters servicing oil platforms in the Gulf ofMexico...|$|R

Some 60, 000 years ago they left their homeland and in {{a relatively short period of}} time (by geological and <b>evolutionary</b> standards) <b>moved</b> to nearly every habitable place on the globe. We are their descendants. The Africans never stopped migrating, but they began to do so with particular vigor beginning about 1400 AD. Patrick Manning tells the story of their movements in his remarkable new book The African Diaspora: A History Through Culture (Columbia UP, 2010). The tale Pat tells might well be divided into three phases: before slavery, during slavery, and after slavery. The middle period usually gets the most attention, but happily Pat well covers the 2 ̆ 2 before 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 after 2 ̆ 2 phases as well. This is an excellent corrective to the standard story because it shows us that for most of modern history African migrants were not really victims, but agents. Prior to the emergence of the international slave trade, they travelled and migrated to North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Near East in large numbers. Slavery of course violently brought millions of them to the Americas. But once it was officially ended (slavery continues to exist today [...] .), the Africans in the diaspora set about considering their rightful place in the world. Should they build lives for themselves 2 ̆ 2 abroad 2 ̆ 2 ? Or should they return to their African homeland? Should they integrate? Or should they remain apart? These questions—which are asked by every large diaspora community—were hotly debated in the cultural and political efflorescence of the 20 th century. To some extent the debate still goes on; and to an even greater extent the African diaspora continues to grow both in numbers and in power. This is an important and neglected topic, and we should all thank professor Manning for shedding light on it...|$|R

40|$|Nature repurposes {{proteins}} via evolutionary processes. Such adaptation {{can come}} at the expense of the original protein's function, which is a trade-off of adaptation. We sought to examine other potential adaptive trade-offs. We measured the effect on ampicillin resistance of ~ 12, 500 unique single amino acid mutants of the TEM- 1, TEM- 17, TEM- 19, and TEM- 15 β-lactamase alleles, which constitute an adaptive path in the evolution of cefotaxime resistance. These protein fitness landscapes were compared and used to calculate epistatic interactions between these mutations and the two mutations in the pathway (E 104 K and G 238 S). This series of protein fitness landscapes provides a systematic, quantitative description of pairwise/tertiary intragenic epistasis involving adaptive mutations. We find that the frequency of mutations exhibiting epistasis increases along the <b>evolutionary</b> pathway. Adaptation <b>moves</b> the protein to a region in the fitness landscape characterized by decreased mutational robustness and increased ruggedness, as measured by fitness effects of mutations and epistatic interactions for TEM- 1 's original function. This movement to such a "fitness territory" has evolutionary consequences and is an important adaptive trade-off and cost of adaptation. Our systematic study provides detailed insight into the relationships between mutation, protein structure, protein stability, and epistasis and quantitatively depicts the different costs inherent in the evolution of new functions...|$|R
30|$|Because {{of their}} scarcity, {{knowledge}} economies thrive under globalisation. This is the milieu within which localised knowledge clusters interact with global value chains managed by multinational corporations. It was, until recently, contested {{as to whether}} globalisation was a meaningful concept (Hirst and Thompson 1996; Ruigrok and Van Tulder 1995; Cooke et al. 2000; Dunning 2000). But there is now consensus that it exists and {{is marked by a}} heightened organisational strength, extensively over the globe and intensively through global value chains. Thus production of goods and services is more deeply integrated for different stages of the value chain in a wider array of global locations than ever before. Global value chains are increasingly embedded in local value chains or clusters. Competitive advantage increasingly lies in firms, regions and countries coming to terms with these new realities, intensifying their direct and indirect capabilities for knowledge-intensive production, enhanced productivity, innovation and new firm formation that accompany integration of local and global value chains. Generative growth feeds off these interactions rather than being unproductively transplanted, as often occurs with ‘redistributive growth’, the style of incentivised and regulated movement of jobs and capital from locations where they were abundant to those where they were not. Theoretically it is an <b>evolutionary</b> concept that <b>moves</b> beyond neoclassical constructs like ‘endogenous growth’. The latter, even with its more realistic acceptance of realities like ‘increasing returns’ and ‘imperfect knowledge’ remains wedded to a notion of the satisficing individual consumer and a reductionism in its analysis of spatial development processes that even one of its main progenitors admits is ‘simplistic’ (Krugman 2000).|$|R
40|$|Kinesins are microtubule-associated motor {{proteins}} that convert the chemical energy of ATP into mechanical energy {{to perform a}} wide range of intracellular motility functions. Kinesin molecules represent long-stretched structures revealing distinct globular motor domains, composed of a conserved catalytic core and a so-called mechanical element. The catalytic core contains the microtubule- and ATP-binding sites. The mechanical element, comprising the neck linker and the neck, has been known to be crucial for motility generation, in general. Human neuron-specific kinesin- 1 (KIF 5 A) and human mitotic kinesin- 5 (Eg 5) are kinesins with conserved motor domains, revealing about 40 % identity in amino acid sequence. In addition, there is a very high level of similarity in their crystal structures. Regardless, Eg 5 moves about 25 times slower than kinesin- 1. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in velocity regulation of kinesin motors have been unclear. The central goal {{of this study was to}} find out which structural elements of the kinesin motor domain are responsible for motility generation, in general and for velocity regulation, in particular. With this intention, C-terminally truncated KIF 5 A and Eg 5 proteins, lacking defined structural elements of the motor domain, were expressed and comparatively analyzed to define the minimal structural organization of the catalytic core required to generate activity. Furthermore, a series of KIF 5 A and Eg 5 chimeras with interchanged neck linker and neck sequences were constructed to determine the structural elements involved in kinesin velocity regulation. The present study provides first evidence that the neck linker and neck elements are involved in the fine-tuning of the velocity at which kinesin motors <b>move.</b> <b>Evolutionary</b> the neck linker and neck might have evolved to adapt the variety of cellular motors to different biological functions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} essay is to present an {{innovative}} - considering the Greek academic research interests - study of the intriguing case of homosexual educators, using their own personal narrations and the narrations of heterosexual educators. Emphasis was given on the way that homosexual educators are being conceived within the educational context, and also on {{the way that they}} experience and manage their homosexual identity regarding their workplace and their everyday life reality. In addition, we examined the evolutionary changes in the experience and management of homosexual identity of educators, resulting in the construction and maintenance of hidden (covert) sexual identities within the educational context. The research procedure that we employed in this study involves qualitative methodological approaches and methods of research such as the method of focus group, semi-structured clinical interview, biographical-narrative interview, ichnographical and metaphorical methods of representation. For our research goals we designed and accomplished six phases of research, through which we used four participants for the sample of homosexual educators and four for the sample of heterosexual educators. The first phase of research demanded the exclusive participation of heterosexual educators who were invited in a group interview in the means of the focus group method, and were asked to negotiate issues of sexuality and homosexuality within the educational context, focusing on the topic of homosexual educators. The next five phases of research concerned the individual participation of homosexual participants in the other research methods that we used. They were asked to discuss issues of sexuality, homosexuality and also conception, meaning-making experience, management and evolutionary change regarding their homosexual identity in educational and other social, familial and interpersonal contexts and ultimately represent their experience and management of homosexual identity using an <b>evolutionary</b> perspective. <b>Moving</b> on to the procedure of analysis and interpretation of the research data, we attempt to highlight the conservative, ethicological perspective that heterosexual educators preserve, in relation to issues of sexuality and homosexuality, which promotes the construction of a policy of silence and restrain (policy known as Don‟t ask don‟t tell) on the case of homosexual identities in educational contexts. In addition, we bring to the surface and shed light on the personal life stories of homosexual educators and also on the way they feel, behave and conceive their own self and others regarding their educational-professional and personal level of life. We also draw on observations concerning the evolutionary construction and maintenance of a hidden-constrained sexual identity which constitutes the reaction against the strict, constraining, conservative educational and other social contexts of Greek society.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a framework for}} constructing an Evolutionary Design Model (EDM) that would enhance the design of complex systems through an efficient process. The framework proposed is generic and suggests a group of systematic methodologies that eventually lead to a fully realized and integrated design model. Within this model, complexities of the design are handled and the uncertainties of the design evolution are managed. Using the framework, vast design spaces can be searched while solutions are intelligently modified, their performance evaluated, and their results aggregated into a compatible set for design decisions. The EDM is composed of several design {{states as well as}} design evolving processes. A design state describes a design at a particular point in time and maps the system's object to the system's requirements and identifies its relation to {{the context in which the}} system will operate. A design evolving process involves many sub-processes which include formulation, decomposition, modeling, and integration. These sub-processes are not always carried out in a sequential manner, but rather a continuous move back and forth to previous and subsequent stages is expected. The resulting design model is described as an <b>evolutionary</b> model that <b>moves</b> a system's design from simple abstract states to more complex and detailed states throughout its evolution. (cont.) The framework utilizes system modeling methodologies that include both logical and mathematical modeling methods. The type of model used within the EDM's evolving processes is highly dependent on and driven by design needs of each process. As the design progresses a shift from logical models to mathematical models occurs within the EDM. Finally, a partial EDM is implemented within the context of a computational design system for Masdar city to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. By Anas Alfaris. Thesis (S. M.)
