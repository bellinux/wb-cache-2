50|$|There are {{two methods}} to {{manufacture}} faceshields, extrusion and <b>injection</b> <b>molding.</b> Faceshields cut from extrusion sheets provide better impact resistance than <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> faceshields because extrusion sheets {{are made of}} high molecular weight plastic pellets while <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> must use lower molecular weight plastic pellets, which provide better melt flowing property needed by <b>injection</b> <b>molding.</b> For example, even 0.8 mm thickness faceshields made of extrusion polycarbonate sheets can withstand {{the impact of a}} 6 mm nominal diameter steel ball traveling at the speed 120 m/s (European standard, protection against high-speed particles - medium energy impact), while <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> faceshields must have at least 1.5 mm thickness to withstand the same impact.

However, due to the very costly complex <b>injection</b> <b>mold,</b> costs are only covered at a batch size of approx. 50.000 stators per year, compared to single component insulation.
