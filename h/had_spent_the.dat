5|$|Cantor {{retired in}} 1913, {{living in poverty}} and {{suffering}} from malnourishment during World War I. The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium {{for the last time}} and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> last year of his life.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Bonds {{left the}} Pirates {{to sign a}} lucrative free agent {{contract}} worth a then-record $43.75 million ($ million today) over six years with the Giants, with whom his father <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> first seven years of his career, and with whom his godfather Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons.

5|$|It {{was early}} {{afternoon}} {{by the time}} Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still {{on the ground in}} some places. Both Tom and Ike <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{night of}} 23/24 April in their pits {{listening}} {{to the sounds of}} the fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position forward of the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E
5|$|The 98th Regiment of Foot, {{raised in}} 1824 in Chichester, {{had a much}} shorter history, but like the 64th <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of its time overseas spending {{a long time in}} South Africa before seeing action in China in the First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War and India on the North West Frontier. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{received}} {{no information about}} the massacre until the summer of 1943, when Pooley, who <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> last {{three years in a}} German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared medically unfit and repatriated. British authorities did not believe Pooley's story on his arrival; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops. Private O'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner-of-war camp. His confirmation of Pooley's story prompted an official investigation.|$|E
5|$|The childless Ladislaus V died on 23 November 1457. A Diet was convened {{to elect}} the new monarch. Matthias' {{maternal}} uncle, Michael Szilágyi, arrived {{with more than}} 10,000 armed noblemen under his command, and the Diet proclaimed Matthias king on 24 January 1458. Matthias returned from Prague, but was only crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary on 29 March 1464, because he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> previous years with fighting against his opponents.|$|E
5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E

5|$|Albion <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered {{the playoffs for the}} first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{temporarily}} {{left the}} Soviet Army with {{the rank of}} Major General in August 1946. He <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> entire war as a political commissar rather than a military commander. After working on reconstruction projects in Ukraine, he again became General Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk. In 1950, he became a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's highest legislative body. Later that year he was appointed Party First Secretary in the Moldavian SSR. In 1952, he {{had a meeting with}} Stalin after which Stalin promoted Brezhnev to the Communist Party's Central Committee as a candidate member of the Presidium (formerly the Politburo).|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} failure of the last Arab attempt to conquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople, regular, almost annual raids were {{undertaken}} by the Caliphate's forces into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 782, a major invasion, led by the Abbasid heir apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), resulted in a humiliating settlement for Byzantium, which was forced to sue for a truce in exchange for an annual payment of 160,000 gold nomismata. In 785, Empress-regent Irene of Athens resolved to cease the payment of the tribute, and warfare recommenced. The Arabs raided the Armeniac Theme, but in early 786 the Byzantines retaliated by sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> last five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions against Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston {{was once}} more forced into exile, but Edward {{recalled}} him {{in less than}} a year. The king <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> intervening time gathering support, and at the time, the only one to resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick. With time, however, opposition to the king grew. Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father's Scottish campaigns, a policy that opened the Border region up to devastating raids from the Scots. This affected Warwick greatly, with his extensive landed interest in the north. Tensions grew {{to the point where the}} king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms. They still did, and at the parliament of March 1310, the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform the royal government.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, British {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 commissioned shipwreck hunter David Mearns and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, {{to locate}} the wreck of Hood, and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, Bismarck. This was {{to be used for}} a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle. This was the first time anyone had attempted to locate Hoods resting place. Mearns <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> previous six years privately researching the fate of Hood with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, Ted Briggs.|$|E
