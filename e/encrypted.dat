5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then <b>encrypted</b> as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, <b>encrypted</b> and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been <b>encrypted,</b> when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the <b>encrypted</b> volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is <b>encrypted</b> with a key known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is <b>encrypted</b> {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E

30|$|Content Confidentiality: The content {{confidentiality}} provided by an approach reflects how the protected attribute values are represented at the SP. We differentiate between order-preserving ciphertexts, distinguishable ciphertexts, and indistinguishable ciphertexts. Order-preserving ciphertexts leak {{information on the}} ordering of the corresponding plaintext values to the SP. If distinguishable ciphertexts are used, the SP is able to differentiate between ciphertexts that <b>encrypt</b> value A from those that <b>encrypt</b> value B. In particular, deterministic encryption schemes produce distinguishable ciphertexts because <b>encrypting</b> equal plaintext values results in equal ciphertexts. If indistinguishable ciphertexts are outsourced, the SP {{is not able to}} differentiate ciphertexts that <b>encrypt</b> value A from those that <b>encrypt</b> value B. In particular, this implies that <b>encrypting</b> a plaintext value twice results in different ciphertexts. Furthermore, based on indistinguishable ciphertexts, attackers can not discover which values are contained in the outsourced data and which are not.|$|R

5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to decrypt files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and <b>encrypted</b> copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware decryption tools can help decrypt files <b>encrypted</b> by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E
5|$|Examples of extortionate {{ransomware}} became {{prominent in}} May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was <b>encrypted</b> with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, {{it was believed}} {{large enough to be}} computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort.|$|E

Starting with Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, volumes other than the operating system volume could be <b>encrypted</b> using the graphical tool.

This {{was estimated to}} cost NOK500 million to install, but could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, {{which would be a}} problem for urgent communications. It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, Microsoft has complemented BitLocker {{with the}} Microsoft <b>Encrypted</b> Hard Drive specification, {{which allows the}} {{cryptographic}} operations of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device's hardware. In addition, BitLocker can now be managed through Windows PowerShell. Finally, Windows 8 introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition, which BitLocker can protect.|$|E
5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title keys are generated and the video content on the disc is <b>encrypted</b> using these keys. The title keys are stored on the disc and themselves <b>encrypted</b> with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E

5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually <b>encrypted</b> by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The <b>encrypted</b> text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E

Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), Kilo attacks the Los Angeles branch of Aspari and corners Chang, who shoots himself.
