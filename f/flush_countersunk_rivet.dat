40|$|Multiple site damage (MSD) is the {{occurrence}} of many small cracks at multiple locations such as rivet holes. Once the MSD is initiated, the strength of structure may be quickly reduced to an unacceptable level and caused catastrophic failure. ^ This dissertation describes research into the fatigue life of lap joint structure with MSD. The load transfer mechanism in joint structure is studied, including several types of rivets, material properties and structure geometry. The load transfer for each rivet is determined {{as a function of}} crack propagation. Two other mechanisms can affect the load transfer mechanism-interference between the rivet and rivet hole due to riveting process, and clamping pressure between the panels, were also investigated. Since these two mechanisms are complicated to analyze, and rely {{on the quality of the}} manufacture and assembly, the riveting process was well controlled by applying the rivet squeeze force through an MTS machine. ^ Single lap joint specimens, containing fatigue MSD in one row of rivet holes, were cycled to failure under constant amplitude loading. A modified MSD life prediction model is used to estimate fatigue life. Predictions for the growth and coalescence of individual cracks are in accordance with the experimental results. During the fatigue tests, the propagation of some small cracks at low remote stress levels were delayed due to clamping-up stress under the <b>countersink</b> <b>rivet</b> head. Marker band analysis, therefore, is utilized to detect the crack growth information under <b>countersink</b> <b>rivet</b> head and includes the delay effect into the fatigue prediction program. ^ The individual/relative effect of two random variables—the interference fit levels and crack length distribution at rivet holes—on MSD fatigue life is investigated. A thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the statistical degradation in residual strength as the Wide Fatigue Damage (WFD) extends by fatigue. The fastener interference, reflected as riveting quality, determines the overall evaluation of fatigue behavior of a lap joint. The influence of both rivet installation (i. e. fastener interference) and initial WFD size on fatigue life and residual strength are presented, and indicate the relative influence of these parameters on structural integrity. ...|$|R

After validation of the FE models using experimental strain measurements, the stress/strain condition in the local three-dimensional (3 D) FE model was simulated under a fatigue loading condition. This local model involved multiple load cases with nonlinearity in material properties, geometric deformation, and contact boundary conditions. The resulting stresses and strains {{were used in the}} Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) strain life equation to assess the fatigue "initiation life", defined as the life to a 0. 5 mm deep crack. Effects of the rivet-hole clearance and rivet head deformation on the predicted fatigue life were identified, and good agreement in the fatigue life was obtained between the experimental and the numerical results.

Studies were made of thirty-four flush riveted joint load deformation curves to obtain their general characteristics and to establish some correlation of yield load as defined in ANC- 5 and as defined in Report on Flush Riveted Joint Strength by ARC Rivet and Screw Allowables Subcommittee (Airworthiness Project 12). The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of rivet diameter joint set, is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values.

40|$|Using {{scanning}} acoustic microscopy, {{optical microscopy}} and scanning electron microscopy, {{in conjunction with}} fractography of fractured surfaces, the crack formation and growth kinetics of subsurface fatigue cracks and surface breaking fatigue cracks near rivets have been characterized in detail in this research. The scanning acoustic microscope was used to quantitatively investigate subsurface fatigue cracks (even when they were very small) at and near <b>countersunk</b> <b>rivets</b> in riveted lap joint specimens {{that are similar to}} the riveted lap joints found in the fuselages of many aircraft. It was found that the maximum nominal applied stress influences the fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior. Eyebrow type cracks develop at lower stresses and centerline cracks develop at higher stresses. At low stress ranges, the fatigue cracks initiate a short distance from the rivet at or near the hidden surface of the chamfered panel. At higher stress amplitudes, the cracks initiate at the blunt knife edge. Residual compressive stresses and fretting are suggested to play more important roles at lower stress ranges. Both types of cracks initiate in a shear mode but transform to tensile, mode I, cracks as they grow. This transition occurs much more rapidly at the higher stress amplitude. At both high and low stresses, the cracks are longer on the fayed surface of the panel than elsewhere. In a comparison of Alclad 2024 -T 3 and Ale lad 2524 -T 3, {{it was found that the}} high purity aluminum alloy 2524 nucleates cracks at a greater number of cycles than the less pure aluminum alloy 2024. At high stress, crack initiation plays less of a roll and the 2024 alloy has a longer life. The scanning acoustic microscope enabled us to study subsurface fatigue cracks. The understanding gained from the characterization of the subsurface fatigue cracks will help in the modeling of crack initiation and growth in the riveted lap joint and will also aid in the improvement of NDE techniques for the detection of these cracks.

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed rivet head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of rivet head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of rivet head is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the <b>countersunk</b> <b>rivet</b> head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R

40|$|Terminating {{action is}} a {{remedial}} repair which entails the replacement of shear head <b>countersunk</b> <b>rivets</b> with universal head rivets which have a larger shank diameter. The procedure was developed to eliminate the risk of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) in the upper rivet row of a fuselage lap joint. A test and evaluation program has been conducted by Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI) to evaluate the terminating action repair of the upper rivet row of a commercial aircraft fuselage lap splice. Two full scale fatigue tests were conducted on fuselage panels using the growth of fatigue cracks in the lap joint. The second test was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the terminating action repair. In both tests, cyclic pressurization loading was applied to the panels while crack propagation was recorded at all rivet locations at regular intervals to generate detailed data on conditions of fatigue crack initiation, ligament link-up, and fuselage fracture. This program demonstrated that the terminating action repair substantially increases the fatigue life of a fuselage panel structure and effectively eliminates the occurrence of cracking in the upper rivet row of the lap joint. While high cycle crack growth was recorded in the middle rivet row during the second test, failure was not imminent when the test was terminated after cycling to well beyond the service life. The program also demonstrated that the initiation, propagation, and linkup of WFD in full-scale fuselage structures can be simulated and quantitatively studied in the laboratory. This paper presents an overview of the testing program and provides a detailed discussion of the data analysis and results. Crack distribution and propagation rates and directions as well as frequency of cracking are presented for both tests. The progression of damage to linkup of adjacent cracks and to eventual overall panel failure is discussed. In addition, an assessment of the effectiveness of the terminating action repair and the occurrence of cracking in the middle rivet row is provided, and conclusions of practical interest are drawn...|$|R

40|$|For {{laminar flow}} to be achieved, any protuberances {{on the surface}} must be small enough to avoid {{transition}} to turbulent flow.

Aircraft structural joints usually have many <b>countersunk</b> bolts or <b>rivets</b> on the outer surface. To maintain no mismatch on outer surfaces, it is desirable to attach the components from the inner surface.

Fabricating components while pressing their outer surfaces against an accurate mold helps to ensure surface smoothness and continuity at joints. These items were considered in evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the joint design concepts. After evaluating six design concepts, two of the leading candidates were fabricated and tested using many small test panels. One joint concept was also built and tested using large panels. The small and large test panel deflections for the leading candidate designs at load factors up to + 1. 5 g's were well within the step and waviness requirements for avoiding transition. The small panels were designed and tested for compression and tension at - 65 F, at ambient conditions, and at 160 F. The small panel results for the three-rib and the sliding-joint concepts indicated that they were both acceptable. The three-rib concept, with tapered splice plates, was considered to be the most practical. A modified three-rib joint that combined the best attributes of previous candidates was designed, developed, and tested. This improved joint met all of the structural strength, surface smoothness, and waviness criteria for laminar flow control (LFC). The design eliminated all disadvantages of the initial three-rib concept except for unavoidable eccentricity, which was reduced and reacted satisfactorily by the rib supports.
