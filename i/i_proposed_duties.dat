40|$|In {{this article}} I briefly sketch two ideas {{regarding}} a future constitutional amendment in Portugal.

Instead, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> we focus our attention on constitutional practice so as to create an “open society of constitutional interpreters”. Second, {{in order to address}} the lack of social trust and the corruption scandals political parties are associated with, I suggest changing the funding system of political life. More precisely, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> that a voucher system is introduced and political parties compete with civil society associations for public funding. This proposal should also intensify citizens’ control and intervention in political life...|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>propose</b> {{the use of}} {{recursive}} queries [24] as an interface for querying {{distributed network}} graph structures. Recursive queries allow a query result to be {{defined in terms of}} itself. This is particularly useful for querying network graphs that exhibit recursive structures. To query these distributed graphs over the Internet, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> using distributed query processing techniques to process recursive queries. I further demonstrate the relationship between in-network execution of recursive queries and traditional routing protocols. Based on this relationship, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> investigating the use of recursive queries for end-hosts to customize routing protocols.

40|$|Dyad-year data on {{international}} conflict are simultaneously qualitative and serially dependent. Extending Beck, Katz, and Tucker’s (1998) methodological contribution, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> transitional models {{that deal with}} these two features of the data. These statistical models explicitly deal with the way a dyad’s particular history of peace or conflict structures current outcomes, consistent with important substantive notions in the IR literature such as reputation-building, signalling, alliance reliability, territoriality, and enduring rivalries. That is, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> statistical models that (a) are easily estimated; (b) resolve long-standing methodological dilemmas, and (c) speak to important theoretical ideas {{in the study of}} international relations. The transitional models <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> generalize beyond the international conflict data analyzed here, to any type of discrete time-series setting. One of the transitional models <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> is a novel methodological contribution in its own right [...] - a dynamic probit model [...] - unifying two hitherto disparate branches of quantitative political methodology (time series and discrete choice). 1 Dyad-year data {{on international}} conflict are widely used in quantitative studies of international relations...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new {{paradigm}} for robot localization using images.

It seems that insects use images to find their way to food, nests, etc. in a similar way <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to use them for a mobile robot localization and navigation. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to make an atlas of images covering the environment in which robot moves and to look for the robot position within this environment by looking for the most similar image in the atlas to that image which the robot sees. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to use a panoramic camera and to map the panoramic image into a cylindrical panoramic image.

40|$|Replication of {{scientific}} experiments {{is critical to}} the advance of science. Unfortunately, the discipline of Computer Science has never treated replication seriously, even though computers are very good at doing {{the same thing over and}} over again. Not only are experiments rarely replicated, they are rarely even replicable in a meaningful way. Scientists are being encouraged to make their source code available, but this is only a small step. Even in the happy event that source code can be built and run successfully, running code is a long way away from being able to replicate the experiment that code was used for. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> that the discipline of Computer Science must embrace replication of experiments as standard practice. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> that the only credible technique to make experiments truly replicable is to provide copies of virtual machines in which the experiments are validated to run. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> that tools and repositories should be made available to make this happen. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to be one of those who makes it happen.

Then <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> {{a new set of}} premises for the question of nothing that derives from a synthesis of the two above mentioned sets.
