Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein.

5|$|The <b>enzymology</b> of proteases {{provides}} some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, before <b>enzymology</b> was well understood, colloids {{were thought to}} be the key to the {{operation}} of enzymes; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter the properties of the water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific substrate, such as a solution of ATPase breaking down ATP. Furthermore, life itself was explainable in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances that make up an organism. As more detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the macromolecular theory, which explains enzymes as a collection of identical huge molecules that act as very tiny machines, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a factory full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple osmotic changes that would be caused by the presence of any solute. In humans, both the thyroid gland and the intermediate lobe (pars intermedia) of the pituitary gland contain colloid follicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of bacterial cellulose is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the β-1→4 glucan chain). Specifics on the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with carbon compounds (such as hexoses, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the β-1→4 glucan chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural <b>enzymology</b> studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts carbon compounds into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E
500|$|Enzymes [...] are {{macromolecular}} biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions. The molecules {{upon which}} enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic {{processes in the}} cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called <b>enzymology</b> and a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, some enzymes have {{lost the ability to}} carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties.|$|E

2500|$|The {{study of}} protein folding began in 1910 with a famous paper by Harriette Chick and C. J. Martin, {{in which they}} showed that the {{flocculation}} of a protein was composed of two distinct processes: the precipitation of a protein from solution was preceded by another process called denaturation, in which the protein became much less soluble, lost its enzymatic activity and became more chemically reactive. [...] In the mid-1920s, Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky proposed that denaturation was a reversible process, a correct hypothesis that was initially lampooned by some scientists as [...] "unboiling the egg". [...] Anson also suggested that denaturation was a two-state ("all-or-none") process, in which one fundamental molecular transition resulted in the drastic changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity; he further noted that the free energy changes upon denaturation were much smaller than those typically involved in chemical reactions. [...] In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized that denaturation was protein unfolding, a purely conformational change {{that resulted in the}} exposure of amino acid side chains to the solvent. [...] According to this (correct) hypothesis, exposure of aliphatic and reactive side chains to solvent rendered the protein less soluble and more reactive, whereas the loss of a specific conformation caused the loss of enzymatic activity. [...] Although considered plausible, Wu's hypothesis was not immediately accepted, since so little was known of protein structure and <b>enzymology</b> and other factors could account for the changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity. [...] In the early 1960s, Chris Anfinsen showed that the folding of ribonuclease A was fully reversible with no external cofactors needed, verifying the [...] "thermodynamic hypothesis" [...] of protein folding that the folded state represents the global minimum of free energy for the protein.|$|E
