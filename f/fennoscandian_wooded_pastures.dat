40|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the 20 th Century the area of {{semi-natural}} grasslands in Estonia decreased substantially, partly due to the collectivization process during the soviet era leading to agricultural abandonment in some areas and intensification in more productive soil types (Henle et al. 2008). Both of these processes led to declines in species diversity as well as homogenisation and loss of character. Within calcareous grasslands loss of grazing leads to colonization by scrub including juniper (Juniperus communis) with very few species and a very different structure, and similar processes occur in other semi-natural grassland types. The unique biodiversity value of semi-natural grasslands in Estonia is well recognised (Dengler et al. 2014), however, an estimation of their value is required to demonstrate to policy makers the urgent requirement for conservation measures. The ecosystem services framework provides a new approach to assess the value and multi-functionality of these habitats. A methodology for assessing ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands is provided in this paper. Management type and intensity have a major influence on semi-natural grassland species composition (Burnside et al. 2007). Therefore the first stage of this project was to assess the relationships between the management regime and the presence of key species in different semi-natural grassland types. The Annex 1 habitat classification was used as the starting point for the study because they are thoroughly mapped in Estonia and form the basis for agri-environmental payments. The five dominant semi-natural grassland habitats in Estonia were selected for this study and include: Northern boreal alluvial meadows (6450), Boreal Baltic coastal meadows (1630), Alvars (6280) and <b>Fennoscandian</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> and meadows (6530 and 9070 respectively). These account for 25 %, 21 %, 15 % and 10 % of the 109592 ha of semi-natural grasslands in Estonia. Four ecosystem services were selected for this study: plant biodiversity, soil carbon storage, biomass production and use for grazing animals. As part of the study, bundles and trade-offs between ecosystem services are identified, as well as hot and cold spots for the provision of ecosystem services. Fig. 1 provides a summary of the share of semi-natural grasslands in Estonia and uses the Environmental Stratification of Estonia (ESE) (Villoslada et al. 2016) to show regional distribution. The results of the project will be translated into policy and decision-making through an online ecosystem services valuation tool in the frame of the LIFE Viva Grass project. The project aims at preventing the loss of High Nature Value grasslands by providing an Integrating Planning Tool and considering socio-economic factors impacting nature conservation policy...|$|E
40|$|The European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{recommends}} {{subsidies are}} only granted for <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> {{with less than}} 100 trees per hectare. This arbitrary guidance exists despite these habitats being among the most biodiverse in rural Europe. To date, most biodiversity research in agricultural landscapes has focused on plants, birds and invertebrates. Bats are also important bio-indicators of agricultural landscapes, but to my knowledge no study has explicitly focused on bat diversity in relation to this policy. In this thesis, I investigate how bat activity, foraging and species richness is affected in twenty-six <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> along a gradient of tree density, from open to dense pastures. In parallel, nearby open fields and deciduous woodlands were sampled, creating a triplet of habitats being surveyed simultaneously. Bat species were divided into feeding guilds to explore how functional diversity affects response to habitat and landscape configuration. The overall contribution of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> to the species pool of bats within a heterogeneous, low intensity agricultural landscape was also explored. I found a consistent increase in bat activity and species richness within <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> along the tree density gradient and across most feeding guilds. This in combination with shrub density was the strongest predictor of total bat activity and foraging; whilst structural diversity of pastures was most strongly correlated with species richness. <b>Wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> contributed more to total species richness than forested habitats. Interestingly, higher activity levels of forest feeding specialists were observed in pastures compared to forests. At the landscape level, amount of water and deciduous forest were the strongest predictors of bat activity. This study demonstrates that tree density within <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> is not a limiting factor of bat activity and that other habitat and landscape parameters are important. <b>Wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> may also be {{an important component of}} current landscapes with little remaining deciduous forest. In conclusion, focusing solely on tree density limits will not help to preserve the ecological requirements for bats within agricultural landscapes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSilvopastoral {{systems of}} the Swiss Jura Mountains serve as a {{traditional}} source of forage and timber in the subalpine vegetation belt, but their vulnerability to land use and climate change puts their future sustainability at stake. We coupled experimental and modeling approaches {{to assess the impact}} of climate change on the pasture-woodland landscape. We drew conclusions on the resistance potential of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> with different management intensities by sampling along a canopy cover gradient. This gradient spanned from unwooded pastures associated with intensive farming to densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> associated with extensive farming. Transplanted mesocosms of these ecosystems placed at warmer and drier conditions provided experimental evidence that climate change reduced herbaceous biomass production in unwooded pastures but had no effect in sparsely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures,</b> and even stimulated productivity in densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Through modeling these results with a spatially explicit model of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> (WoodPaM) modified for the current application, results were extrapolated to the local landscape under two regionalized Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for climate change. This led to the suggestion that within the Jura pasture-woodlands, forage production in the near future (2000 – 2050 AD) would be affected disproportionately throughout the landscape. A stable forage supply in hot, dry years would be provided only by extensive and moderate farming, which allows the development of an insulating tree cover within grazed pastures. We conclude that such structural landscape diversity would grant wood-pastures with a buffering potential in the face of climate change in the forthcoming decades...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} land-use policies and natural events {{on the evolution of}} two <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> in the Jura Mountains in Switzerland between 1934 and 2000. The socioeconomic context and the local conditions were seen as major driving forces influencing land management practices which in turn redefined land-use policies. We studied the dynamics of the Jura Mountains' <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures,</b> combining a thorough knowledge of the historic context with aerial image analysis. Besides pointing out general milestones in the evolution of Swiss land policy, we compiled chronicles on the management for both study sites on the basis of archives and interviews. Aerial images taken at time intervals of approximately 15 years were chosen to identify land-cover changes. The method used to analyze them relied on a structural classification of phytocoenoses, thus allowing the determination of four categories of tree-cover densities ranging from unwooded pastures to ungrazed forest. We reported overall aerial changes for each tree density class as well as spatial transitions from one category to another. The combination of spatial statistics with qualitative data depicting the evolution of the historic context gives {{a better understanding of the}} land-use changes and their rationale. The most important changes in tree density occurred during World War II and resulted in a more open landscape. The intensive use of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> during the war was the consequence of a high demand for wood and food resources. Postwar protectionist regulations, agricultural subsidies, and technical improvements maintained considerable pressure on <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Storms and drought episodes further exacerbated this process in some areas. The trend then reversed from the 1970 s onwards because of the limitations put on milk production and the falling price of wood. This resulted in a more extensive use of pastures, leading to tree encroachment. However, remote sites were more impacted than pastures closer to inhabited areas, which exhibited a trend towards more segregation between grassland and densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> With both extensification and segregation of land use, the complex vegetation mosaic and the landscape diversity that characterize <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> are threatened but still offer good economic opportunities that call for differentiated management strategies...|$|R
40|$|Summary 1. In {{endangered}} <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> ecosystems established tree saplings {{are frequently}} found in spatial association with protective structures, suggesting nurse effects. This associational resistance {{is thought to}} be a driving force behind tree regeneration in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Experimental evidence for associational resistance is, however, scarce. We studied the effects of unpalatable plants on tree sapling performance in a <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> ecosystem in Switzerland and tested the associational resistance hypothesis experimentally. 2. We transplanted 600 Picea abies saplings of two size classes (5 cm and 10 cm) in plots: (i) with unpalatable plants (either Gentiana lutea or Cirsium acaule, representing a chemically and mechanically defended species, respectively); (ii) with one of both unpalatable plants clipped to the ground; and (iii) without any unpalatable plants. Grazing intensity was measured once in each plot and tree sapling performance was followed for 2 consecutive years. 3. Grazing intensity was significantly higher in plots without unpalatable plants, and significantly higher in plots with Cirsium than with Gentiana. Correspondingly, sapling survival (21 ¿ 5 % and 10 ¿ 6 % after 1 and 2 grazing years, respectively) was significantly higher near unpalatable plants, and significantly higher in plots with Gentiana than with Cirsium. Large tree saplings survived significantly better than small ones, and depended less on the unpalatable plants for survival. 4. Except for saplings planted near Gentiana, sapling removal by cows and horses was the major cause of death, the extent varying between unpalatable species and treatments. 5. The growth in height of the saplings was unaffected by the treatments. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that unpalatable plants can enhance tree regeneration in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Sapling survival was significantly higher near unpalatable plants where grazing intensity was significantly lower. Protection against cattle is particularly important for small saplings. These results have important management implications for the endangered and disappearing <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> in western Europe. Transplanting tree saplings near unpalatable plants could be an alternative reforestation technique in intensively grazed <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> On the other hand, removal of unpalatable plants and shrubs might prevent or slow down undesired tree encroachment in less intensively grazed areas.

40|$|Question: Are tree saplings in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> {{spatially}} {{associated with}} specific nurse structures or plants that facili-tate tree sapling survival? Location: <b>Wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> in the Jura Mountains, Switzer-land. Methods: In two sites, 73 km apart, we sampled 294 plots of 4 m 2, systematically distributed on 1 ha. We recorded number and height of all established Picea abies saplings (> 1 a {{of age and}} up to 40 cm in height), and visually estimated cover of rocks, shrubs, tree stumps, overhanging tree branches and unpalatable plant species. Results: Despite differences in site characteristics, we found overall positive effects of cover of unpalatable plants, rocky outcrops and tree stumps on the density of Picea saplings. Plots with tree stumps and higher cover of rocky outcrops and unpalatable plants {{were more likely to}} contain Picea saplings. Conclusions: Unpalatable plants, rocky outcrops and tree stumps seem to form safe sites for Picea saplings in this grazed system, improving their establishment and survival.

40|$|Agroforestry {{has long}} proved itself to provide many {{ecosystem}} services, ranging from provision of biodiversity to climate mitigation. In Switzerland, {{the region of}} Les Franches-Montagnes {{is famous for its}} large areas of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures,</b> which compose the typical mosaic structure of the landscape. Integrated management plans and typologies of the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> have been developed to better understand and manage these silvopastoral systems. However, few studies have considered their benefits to the local population and assessed their role in the landscape as an ecosystem services provider. This study aims to show how the people of the region perceive ecosystem services provision in their surrounding landscape and how the latter contributes to their well-being. To do so, a survey using public participation GIS developed for the AGFORWARD project, was answered by the inhabitants of Muriaux, one of the 13 municipalities of the district of Les Franches-Montagnes. In this survey, they were asked to map different ecosystem services indicators on web-based maps of the region. Their answers were analyzed and the relationship between the ecosystem services indicators and land cover types was assessed. The results show that the diversified landscape of Les Frances-Montagnes provides many ecosystems services. However, the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> do not seem to hold more importance than other elements of the landscape in the provision of the latter. Answers to additional question of the survey suggest that the contribution of the landscape to personal well- being is mainly based on people-landscape relationships, such as tranquility and space and on social interaction between the inhabitants. Because this study only assesses a small proportion {{of the population of the}} region, it can be regarded as an exploratory work on the perception of ecosystem services in the Franches-Montagnes...|$|R

40|$|A {{system of}} <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> can be {{described}} by seven biological state variables (trees, shrubs, underwood grasslands, fallows, eutrophic meadows, oligrotrophic lawns and cattle) linked by a network of dynamic interactions, which are controlled by altitude and human activities. PATUMOD is a spatially implicit compartment model designed to simulate vegetation dynamics in such silvopastoral ecosystems at community level and according to an equilibrium paradigm. Computer simulations show that the state variables generally end up on a steady-state (one-point attractor), independent on their initial values but strongly dependent on cattle load. At a given altitude, to each value of the stock density is corresponding a stable equilibrium characterised by a given relative cover of each vegetation component. If the initial values are very far of the attractor, a long succession of intermediate stages is required before leading to the steady-state. A remarkable exception to this rule can occur at low altitude, with a repellor between switching trajectories towards two attractors, corresponding to a threshold between scarcely and densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> PATUMOD {{can be applied to}} simulate different management scenarios, which include changing global stock density and cutting trees or shrubs...|$|R

40|$|Vast {{areas of}} central Saskatchewan are {{occupied}} by aspen groves, aspen forest and mixed-wood (Rowe, 1959). A {{part of the}} aspen forest has been cleared and is now utilized as pastures. These pastures may {{be referred to as}} 'wooded', 'bushland' or 'northern wooded' pastures. Though, historically, the utilization of the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> {{can be traced back to}} the times of early settlers, their development as government sponsored pasture dates back to the early 1940 's. While the first government community pasture in the grassland zone was established in 1922 at Matador (Moen, 1964), it was not until 1941 that a community pasture was set up at Beaver Hills in the forest zone. By the early 1950 's it became obvious that the livestock industry was being greatly hampered by insufficient grazing facilities. The pastures in the grassland region could not cope with the increasing demand for grazing needs due to low carrying capacity as a result of frequent droughts. In the northern fringe of settlement there were still present vast areas of unutilized submarginal lands under aspen forest. The soil under aspen forest is podzolic, often low in fertility, of sandy texture, stony and poorly drained in low lying areas so that its tillage for cereal crops was not feasible. The importance of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> would further increase with the rising demand of beef production. Haase (1964) has outlined the need and importance of increased forage production in Canada. He suggested that an additional 15 million acres of improved land would be needed by 1980. The investigators in various fields discussed effectively the problems and needed fields of study in the establishment of northern <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> in a meeting on "The development of pasture from bushlands in western Canada" under the auspecies of Canada Department of Agriculture in 1964. Perhaps, the most important aspect of the problems that were discussed at the meeting, was the need for understanding the response of vegetation, native as well as seeded, to grazing. The present study was undertaken primarily to consider the effect of grazing on herbaceous vegetation in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> This involved the selection and study of comparable grazed and ungrazed stands under three different 'habitat' types: forest; forest, cleared; and forest, cleared, ploughed and seeded. The study sites were located in areas, potentially capable of supporting aspen forest on podzolic, degraded black or grey wooded soil.

We examined if the spatial redistribution of nitrogen among habitats by cattle could restore nutrient-poor conditions in preferred foraging habitats, and conversely whether such translocation {{could lead to}} extreme eutrophication in preferred resting habitats. We used nitrogen content of different diet classes, habitat use, foraging and defecation behavior, weight gain, and nitrogen losses in the actual situation to explore four different habitat proportion scenarios and two different foraging strategies to calculate a net nitrogen balance per habitat. An atmospheric deposition of 30 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 with varying interception factors according to the habitat types was included in an integrated nitrogen balance. All scenarios showed a net nitrogen transport from grassland and <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> to forest habitat. We found that nitrogen redistribution strongly depends on habitat proportion. Nitrogen losses from preferred grassland habitat can be high, given its proportion is small. Depletion is only to be expected at excretion-free areas and probably is of minor importance to trigger the establishment of woody species. In general, nitrogen transported by cattle was much lower than input by atmospheric deposition, but grazing can compensate for high N inputs in excretion-free areas and maintain grassland types that support critical loads of 20 - 25 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. In none of the scenarios, N transport by cattle resulted in the exceeding of critical nitrogen loads to vulnerable forest ground vegetation...|$|R

Interactions between the two contrasting life-forms, trees and herbs, in savannas may be synergistic or antago-Review Mediterranean-climate oak savannas: the interplay between abiotic environment and species interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} my thesis is {{analysis}} {{and evaluation of}} development of wood pastures at several locations in the Elbe lowlands from {{the first half of}} 19 th century up to the present. The area is characterized by its fertility and the large share of arable land. The data analysis was developed using a geographic information system (GIS). The basic documents were maps and written operate of Stationary cadaster. The results of the work are map compositions depicting the change trajectories of wood pastures (extinct, continuous and new), graphs show the area of individual trajectories and evaluate the utility of written operate of the Stacionary cadastre. We have put the obtained information about the natural and social-economic development of the area into context. We got a possible explanation of development, therefore, why the old <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> vanish and new ones arisen elsewhere. Changes of wood pastures were influenced by socio-economic development of the area and probably by distance from a watercourse. The informations obtained from written operate of Stacionary cadaster are useless for this thesis...|$|R
40|$|A cell-grid {{method was}} used to survey {{seasonal}} changes in four herbaceous communities of a <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture.</b> Permanent plots consisted in 1 -m 2 grids subdivided into 100 cells of 1 dm 2. In each cell of each plot and every month from May to September, we estimated dominance, and grazing occurrence of all species. Plant communities included an eutrophic grazed meadow, a temporary refused meadow, an underwood herb community and an oligotrophic lawn. Our results showed that seasonal changes in species composition were very strong and scale-dependent. Changes at plot scale were mainly driven by a seasonal shift. Changes at cell scale suggested high small-scale dynamics of species. Despite high changes at cell scale, {{the structure of the}} community did not change and local species richness did not show any trend. We found no correlation between the turnover at cell scale and cattle activity. We conclude that dynamics and internal species turnover of the community at fine scale and short time seem more driven by internal characteristics of the community than by disturbances induced by cattle. Furthermore, at seasonal scale, plant communities may be stable in their structure despite fluctuations in their texture...|$|R
40|$|In the {{woodlands}} of Sardinia, {{as in many}} other areas of the Mediterranean region, grazing of domestic animals is still very common, though often {{in the absence of any}} sustainable management logic or technique. The present work analyzes the effects of excessive grazing pressure on a <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> in the municipality of Orgosolo (Nuoro province), emphasizing the effects on the natural regeneration of the oak species (Quercus ilex and Quercus pubescens). This study has revealed the positive effects of the interaction between shrubs and seedlings of tree species. Crataegus monogyna proved to be the most efficient shrub species in favouring the establishment and growth of saplings; Rubus ulmifolius is efficient in the establishing phase but somewhat less so in the following stages. The other shrub species (Prunus spinosa, Genista pichi-sermolliana, Stachys glutinosa) play a lesser facilitating role. Despite the fact that seedlings are found in more than half (56 %) of the shrub patches, the average age of the seedlings (14 &# 177; 0. 6 yrs) and their small average size (height 24 &# 177; 1. 4 cm) lead to think that the present grazing pressure is incompatible with any concrete chance of success for their natural regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Browsing by {{livestock}} {{has been}} identi-fied {{as an important}} factor preventing tree regen-eration in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Two field experiments were performed to investigate the effects of cattle browsing on tree sapling growth in a mountain-wooded pasture. Two size classes (ca. 12 – 17 cm and 41 – 59 cm) of each of 4 species (Picea abies, Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylv-atica) were exposed to zero, low and high grazing intensities. We measured the proportion of sap-lings browsed {{and the effect of}} browsing on growth. A mowing treatment within the zero grazing intensity treatment showed no significant effect on sapling growth. One percent of the large saplings but 25 % of the small saplings escaped browsing. Saplings were better protected when surrounded by taller vegetation. The proportion of saplings browsed was not significantly different among species although evergreen tree saplings lost a larger proportion of biomass than deciduous species when browsed. Under grazing, average current-year shoot production and total above-ground biomass of all species were significantly reduced. Browsing effects tended to be smaller at the lower grazing intensity. Because the deciduous species were least reduced in aboveground growth, especially under the low grazing intensity, we conclude that at least in short-term, deciduous species are less affected by cattle browsing...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Abangares, Cañas and plantations of teak (Tectona grandis) and melina (Gmelina arborea) in the cantons of Hojancha and Nandayure, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The overall objective was to determine the potential production of forest biomass within 20 Km of the company Biomass and develop allometric models that relate the diameter at breast height (dbh) under the trade Smalian volume and weight of usable waste in plantations teak and melina as one of the specific objectives. The methodology of satellite programs as Quantum Gis 2. 4 or Google Earth producers were used to locate sites and the SAS statistical program to generate prediction equations waste. A total of 5611. 55 hectares of producing sites, of which detected 44 % of the territory are forest plantations, 31 % wooded thickets while the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> constitute 25 %. The total biomass production by type of coverage was estimated as follows: 10992. 96 tons of biomass are areas of woodland <b>pasture,</b> <b>wooded</b> thickets 96584. 62 tonnes to a total of 43423. 66 tonnes of biomass from forest plantations. Regarding the prediction of dry weight of waste gmelina 3 equations for 5 to 35 cm of dbh trees 3 equations and teak tree diameters of 5 to 15 cm dbh trees were generated The suggestion of the preliminary equation was used {{for the purpose of this}} work is provided. We conclude that most of the production area is concentrated within 10 kilometers radius from the company Biomass and forest plantations account for most of the area of the area within this radius.
