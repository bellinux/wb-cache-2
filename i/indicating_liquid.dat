Although there have been no indications of multicellular life on Mars, there may be a possibility of microbial life in the subsurface. Since it appears that all of the necessary elements for life on Mars exist, it is instrumental for scientists to analyze terrestrial ecosystems that might be analogous to those on Mars. Life on Earth has shown a great amount of diversity in ability to survive extreme environments utilizing a stunning array of energy sources, electron donors, electron acceptors, salinity, pressures, and temperature ranges. From the study of Mars-like terrestrial ecosystems, some scientists have suggested that the methanogens would be a possible candidate to survive Mars 2 ̆ 7 subsurface conditions. There are various Mars 2 ̆ 7 conditions that could be tested on Earth to confirm or deny the methanogens 2 ̆ 7 ability to survive on the planet. Since the survival of methanogens depends on the presence of liquid water, which would probably be seasonal at best on Mars, their ability to survive desiccation will be key in their potential to inhabit Mars 2 ̆ 7 subsurface. In this research, the methanogens Methanobacterium formicicum, Methanothermobacter wolfeii, and Methanosarcina barkeri were grown on JSC Mars-I soil simulant and exposed to varying times of desiccation. Since the byproduct of the methanogens 2 ̆ 7 growth is methane, methane was measured in the head gas of the samples upon rehydration and incubation. These measurements were used to determine survival. The methanogens studied were capable of survival and subsequently methane production upon rehydration after all of the periods of desiccation tested. M. Formicicum was tested over periods of 10 and 27 days, while M. wolfeii and M. barkeri were tested over periods of 10 days. These results support the hypothesis that methanogens could survive in Mars 2 ̆ 7 subsurface if liquid water were present. The methanogens could be a key ingredient in the terraforming of Mars, and at this point remain an increasingly possible candidate for past, present, or future Martian life...|$|E

30|$|This section {{emphasizes}} on optimizing {{the values of}} production and injection parameters of the optimum scenario by improving the oil recovery factor and maximum sweep for the reservoir. Tubing wellhead pressure (THP) and bottom-hole pressure (BHP) are used to control the drawdown of reservoir. BHP corresponds, where operator has installed control valves (subsurface), otherwise well head pressure (WHP) {{is used as a}} control mode. BHP is denoted by pwf (flowing bottom-hole pressure) or pws (shut in pressure). According to Darcy law the lesser the BHP, the higher the drawdown and the more will be the oil recovery. The same principle is applied to THP as well, however, if the THP decreases and BHP increases, this <b>indicates</b> <b>liquid</b> load up in the well. Therefore, in the scenarios 4, these two controlling factors are optimized. Table  3 and Table  4 provide details on injection well control parameters. It can be seen that the well control parameter (I) is controlled by the tubing head pressure (THP) and well control (GI) is controlled by the reservoirs rate.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{synthesis}} N-substituted pyrrole monomers with liquid crystal and dendritic side groups, followed by their subsequent polymerisation and mesaurement of the polymer properties. The second objective beyond the synthesis of these novel polymer materials was to investigate how potential liquid crystals and dendritic side groups affected the conjugation and planarit of the polypyrrole backbone, {{for the purpose of}} conductivity applications. Four differnt types of molecules were synthesised: 1. Polypyrroles with terminally and laterally attached mesogenic side groups (monomers/polymers 1 & 2) 2. Polypyrroles with first and second generation dendritic side groups, terminated by alkyl chains (monomers/polymers 3 & 4) 3. Polyprroles functionalised by first and second generation dendritic moities with hydrophilically-terminated alkyl chains (monomers/polyers 5 & 6) 4. Polypyrrole hybrid materials: second generation dendrimer with terminal liquid crystal groups (monomers/polymers 7) Although seven polymers were intended to be synthesised, polymers (4) and (6) were unable to be characterised, due to very poor solubility. However polymers (1), (2), (5) and (7), successfully underwent hydrolysis of the terminal and lateral ester side groups to carboxylic acids, making a total of nine novel N-substituted polypyrroles synthesised, within this project. The synthesis began with the generation of the monomer compounds (monomers 1 - 7). This was done by nucleophilic substitution of the potential side chain liquid crystal or dendritic moieties on a benzyl ring using a Williamson ether synthesis. A flexible hexyl spacer group was sustituted onto the intermediate compounds, followed by the attachment of pyrrole at the heteroaton site. Thin layer chromatography was used to follow the progress of each reaction and the intermediate compounds were subjected to column chromatography and high vacuum distillation for purification. Characterisation techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometry, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, [sup] 1 H NMR spectrometry and elemental analysis were used to determine the purity and structural indentity of each monomer compound. Electrochemical (EC) polymerisation of monomers (1) and (3) on conductive indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass were attempted first. The cyclic voltammograms indicated that the polymerisation was successful, and the monomer oxidation and polymer doping and dedoping potentials were determined. However this method of polymer synthesis was abandoned, as the yield of the polymer film was too low and the polymer product was very difficult to remove from the ITO substrate for further analysis. Chemical polymerisation with FeCl[sub] 3 in chloroform was successful, as indicated by [sup] 1 H NMR, KBr IR, and UV-visible spectrometry, and the yields of the polymer products were significantly higher than those of the EC method. Physical properties measurements (electrical conductivity, scanning electron microscopy, hot-stage optical microscopy, solubility testing and differential scanning calorimetry) were carried out, {{in order to determine the}} general natures and to indicate any possible applications of the novel polypyrrole materials synthesised. From the spectroscopic data and physical measurements, it was concluded that polymers (1), (2), (3), (5) and (7) and their corresponding carboxylic acids (1 a), (2 a), (5 a) and (7 a) had been successfully synthesised, as proton NMR confirmed the disappearance of the 2, 5 -hydrogens of pyrrole, and in addition conductivity measurements using simple 2 -probe and ven der Pauw 4 -probe methods on undoped polymers (1 a), (2 a), and (7 a) gave reproducible conductivity values which classified them as being potential semi-conductors (2. 2 x 10 [sup]- 4, 6. 7 x 10 [sup]- 5 and 7. 8 x 10 [sup]- 5 Sm[sup]- 1 respectively). UV-visible spectrophotometry indicated that hydrolysis of the laterally attached liquid crystal ester groups to carboxyliv acids significantly reduced the pp* energy gap of polymer (1). (from 3. 9 eV to 2. 48 eV). It was suggested that hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic acid might have improved the planarity and conjugation of the polymer backbone and transformed the insulating ester polymers to potential semi-conductors. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot-stage optical microscopy (HSM) were used to determine the phase transitions of polymers (1 a) and (2 a). The DSC traces showed small peaks, <b>indicating</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal phase transitions (nematic phases observed from 105 - 248 [degrees]C, 105 - 170 [degrees]C respectively). These were later confirmed by the use of HSM, as nematic textures were observed in the expected temperature region for nematic liquid crystals. In addition the ethalpy changes for the phase transitions were estimated, and polymers (1 a) and (2 a) were found to have nematic-isotropic phase transitions within the expected range of values. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphology of the polymer materials. Generally the N-substituted polypyrroles with dendritic side groups were found to have more porous morphologies, while N-substituted polypyrroles with potentially mesogenic side groups appeared to have more continuous and smoother morphologies. However, polymer (7 a) was found to have the most porous morphology and it also add an unexpectedly high conductivity value. Polymer (7 a) was the only polypyrrole hybrid material synthesised in this project, and it appeared that combining all three polymeric units (dendrimers, LC and CP) into one polymer system improved the planarity if the polymer backbone, encouraged the formation of a porous structure which facilitated p-type doping of the polymer by iodine vapour...|$|E
40|$|A {{habitable}} exoplanet is a {{world that}} can maintain stable liquid water on its surface. Techniques and approaches to characterizing such worlds are essential, as performing a census of Earth-like planets {{that may or may}} not have life will inform our understanding of how frequently life originates and is sustained on worlds other than our own. Observational techniques like high contrast imaging and transit spectroscopy can reveal key indicators of habitability for exoplanets. Both polarization measurements and specular reflectance from oceans (also known as "glint") can provide direct evidence for surface liquid water, while constraining surface pressure and temperature (from moderate resolution spectra) can <b>indicate</b> <b>liquid</b> water stability. Indirect evidence for habitability can come from a variety of sources, including observations of variability due to weather, surface mapping studies, and/or measurements of water vapor or cloud profiles that indicate condensation near a surface. Approaches to making the types of measurements that indicate habitability are diverse, and have different considerations for the required wavelength range, spectral resolution, maximum noise levels, stellar host temperature, and observing geometry.
