500|$|American Recordings was {{partially}} absorbed by Columbia Records in early 1998. [...] Though the arrangement preserved the American label, The Black Crowes transferred to Columbia after privately expressing {{their desire to}} disassociate themselves from American Recordings founder Rick Rubin. [...] Despite working under a larger label, the band felt they had more freedom and support under Columbia; Chris remarked, [...] "At American, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a record company did. [...] We never had an A guy. [...] Now we have a product manager.... It's like... I didn't know what the music business was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Avis was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. She died later that year, {{at the age of}} 58. Of his loss, Blake said, [...] "In my life <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was to be alone. At first when Avis got sick, I thought she just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose I knew from when we found out she had the TB, I understood that {{it was just a matter}} of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} that this air would be {{everything}} for her; and so it would, with any ordinary case. But a child would {{take better care of}} itself. I have to watch her every minute, like a child; and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she will do next." ...|$|R

2500|$|Thematically, {{the album}} {{addresses}} romance, with Boyd noting, [...] "it's {{about love and}} finding art and success in love. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I'm going to be writing about until I'm actually writing about it. It's what's relevant in my heart and mind. There's definitely a romantic undertone and overtone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ruey, you jist go {{and give}} a look at 'em," [...] said Miss Roxy. [...] "I declare, that boy! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he will do next; but there didn't seem to be nothin' to get into out there but the sea, and the beach is so shelving, a body can't well fall into that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Three or four {{of these}} vessels called at Mota while I was there. On one day three were in sight. They {{told me they were}} shot at at Whitsuntide, Sta. Maria, Vanua Lava, &c.
