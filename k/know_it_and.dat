The Germans were experiencing logistical problems after advancing over the ravaged 1916 Somme battlefield, subject to constant attack by the RFC, and with their supplies and equipment pulled by horses in poor shape. A German offensive near Arras ("Mars", 9 German divisions, 28 March), against the junction of First and Third Armies, was predicted exactly by British Intelligence and was repulsed. After this was beaten back, between 29 and 31 March the Germans pushed on Amiens again. A Canadian brigade took part in an action at Moreuil Wood (30 March).|$|E

500|$|The B-52's and R.E.M. became by far {{the most}} famous musical {{products}} of Athens in the 1980s, when both bands launched a string of hits. Their roots in the city's local scene go back to the 1970s and early 1980s. The B-52's formed after a St. Valentine's Day party in 1977. The members had little musical knowledge, but performed new wave music with a cheeky and humorous image and sound. They were known for their campy thrift store fashion, and their unusual and eye-catching music videos for hits like [...] "Rock Lobster" [...] and [...] "Love Shack". Though the B-52's were the first Athens band to achieve national prominence, their popularity was soon eclipsed by R.E.M.. The future members of the band R.E.M. moved to Athens to work and/or attend the University of Georgia, including bassist Mike Mills and former drummer Bill Berry. The group began performing as R.E.M. in 1980. They became locally prominent, and released a single, [...] "Radio Free Europe", that was a major college rock hit. Their popularity grew with a series of singles, EPs and albums that made R.E.M. the top underground band in the country, finally breaking into the mainstream with 1987's [...] "The One I Love" [...] and [...] "It's the End of the World as We <b>Know</b> <b>It</b> (<b>And</b> I Feel Fine)". By 1991's Out of Time album— which featured vocals by Kate Pierson of The B-52s— and its acclaimed follow-up Automatic for the People (named after the motto of Weaver D's, a local Athens soul-food eatery), R.E.M. had become one of the world's biggest rock bands. The band's style went through many evolutions but originally had a jangle pop sound and harmonies often compared to folk-rock band The Byrds; singer and songwriter Michael Stipe is known for obscure, allusive lyrics delivered in a monotonous drone. The success of R.E.M. and the B-52's brought attention from major labels and music media to Athens, and many local bands received a career boost.|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown {{as she sat}} on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, {{standing at the edge}} of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E

However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

2500|$|The Gospel of Matthew is anonymous: {{the author}} is not named within the text, and the superscription [...] "according to Matthew" [...] was added {{some time in the}} 2nd century. The {{tradition}} that the author was Matthew the Apostle begins with Papias of Hierapolis (c.AD 100–140), an early bishop and Apostolic Father, who is cited by the Church historian Eusebius (AD 260–340), as follows: [...] "Matthew collected the oracles [...] in the Hebrew language , and each one interpreted [...] them as best he could." [...] On the surface this could imply that Matthew's gospel itself was written in Hebrew or Aramaic by the apostle Matthew and later translated into Greek, but nowhere does the author claim to have been an eyewitness to events, and Matthew's Greek [...] "reveals none of the telltale marks of a translation." [...] Scholars have put forward several theories to explain Papias: perhaps Matthew wrote two gospels, one, now lost, in Hebrew, the other the surviving Greek version; or perhaps the logia were a collection of sayings rather than the gospel; or by dialektōi Papias may have meant that Matthew wrote in the Jewish style rather than in the Hebrew language.
