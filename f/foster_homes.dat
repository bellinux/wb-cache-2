40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on what is {{considered}} to be a suitable <b>foster</b> <b>home.</b> For the study to be carried out an application had to be made to get access to the <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> assessments in a medium-sized municipality in Sweden. With the support of attachment theory and theory of standards different categories have been picked out and analyzed in <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> assessements that have been approved. The conclusion to what {{is considered to be}} a suitable <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> is a complex issue, as there are many factors that are interacting. Social workers seem to focus on the importance of a family’s ability to provide some kind of stability and security for a child who is considered to be placed within their home. An important feature that the parents need to show is some kind of potential to form a secure attachment for a child. The <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> may be considered suitable regardless of the foster parents background and current situation as long as the foster child has the potential to form a secure attachment to either of them. In a normative perspectiv the foster parents should have a good and stable relationship and the <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> should be placed close to nature. Another feature that the social workers seem to prefer is to place a child in a <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> where the <b>foster</b> parents are related or somehow closely connected to the child...|$|R

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, Monroe {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war effort, she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story resulted in increased interest in her films.|$|E

Many reported being placed with people with limited experience of children or with older couples.

Sexual abuse by foster parents, their children or other relatives was also reported.|$|E
