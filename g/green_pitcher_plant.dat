40|$|Natural History & EvolutionSarracenia purpurea, {{commonly}} known as purple <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants,</b> are carnivorous plants found in wetlands with low nutrients. We compared <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> between {{two different types of}} wetlands, a bog and a swale, to determine if the different habitats affected their phenotypic characteristics. We hypothesized that the <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> at Grass Bay would be, on average, larger than the <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> at Mud Lake Bog due to less environmental stress, and that plants with more red colored pitchers would have a higher mass of insect catch than <b>plants</b> with <b>greener</b> <b>pitchers.</b> Height, width, color, number of <b>pitchers</b> per <b>plant,</b> and density of insect catch were recorded at each site, and compared between the two sites. We found that Mud Lake Bog had plants with a higher average insect catch density and also higher average proportion of red <b>pitchers</b> to <b>plants</b> at Grass Bay. Our results suggest that environmental pressures do have an impact on phenotypic traits of S. purpurea...|$|R
40|$|Natural History & EvolutionThe purple <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> (Sarracenia purpurea) {{requires}} both {{capture of}} prey insects to supplement nutrients from the nutrient‐poor soil {{in which they}} live and inhabitation by Diptera larvae to digest these nutrients. We wish to determine if hood morphology in the purple <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> has evolved to attract prey or to suit female mosquito (Wyeomyia smithii) and midge (Metriocnemus knabi) preferences for oviposition sites. We measured various aspects of hood morphology (height, width, opening width, surface area and opening area), and rated each pitcher on a scale of percent red coloration, and related each of these factors to number of captured prey, number of larvae, and biomass of all dry contents of the pitcher. All components of pitcher hood size and opening were found to have a significantly positive relationship with inquiline larval populations, and <b>greener</b> <b>pitchers</b> had both a significantly higher proportion of larval populations and populations of significantly greater size than red pitchers. In contrast, the number of prey captured was not related to either pitcher morphology or color. We conclude that increased pitcher hood size and opening size, as well as <b>greener</b> <b>pitcher</b> color, are preferred by mosquito and midge females for oviposition sites, but these attributes do not increase prey capture success...|$|R

We tested whether the midge larvae were responsible for the elimination of other mosquito species.

Perennial, aquatic herb with an underwater, thick horizontal root about 5-10 centimeters (2-4 in) long and 6 millimeters (0.25 in) thick. This particular species grows in the cracks in stream beds. Each leaf arches upward and is 5-10 centimeters (2-4 in) long with a pointed tip.

40|$|Plant growth-promoting {{bacteria}} (PGPB) {{have been}} studied in many agriculturally interesting plants, but never in pitcher plants. 	Sarracenia oreophila (the <b>green</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant)</b> is an endangered species in Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina (Rice 2010). With the help of Dr. Jim Spain's lab, a previous student in Dr. Gerald Pullman's lab discovered evidence that nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Burkholderia spp.) live within these pitcher plants. This study aims to determine whether these nitrogen-fixing bacteria confer a benefit to their host plants by providing fixed nitrogen. To do this, pitcher plants were inoculated with the Burkholderia and grown on a control medium, a medium without sugar (as the sugar causes the bacteria to grow until they hinder the plants), various media that are missing nitrogen-containing compounds usually provided in growth media, and a medium completely lacking nitrogen. These plants were compared to control plants on the same media {{that had not been}} inoculated with Burkholderia. The plants' biomass and root growth were measured. The data suggest that Burkholderia may stimulate plant biomass growth when sufficient nitrogen is present and there may be a nitrogen-threshold that needs to be met in order to sustain the Burkholderia-Sarracenia symbiosis. Also, the Burkholderia has a negative effect on roots grown in high-nitrogen media, possibly due to competition for nutrients. M. S.

5000|$|Embedded {{within the}} {{longleaf}} pine ecosystem are countless varieties of microhabitats. Among the more unique of these habitats are <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> bogs. <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> and their companion plants are specialized {{to exist in}} a narrow set of conditions. Soil moisture is critical and many [...] "bog" [...] communities are actually {{the result of a}} hard, impermeable clay layer beneath porous sand. Rainwater seeps through the sand but runs into a clay layer where it is either trapped (like a pool) or seeps out the side of a hill. These nutrient-poor, moist sites are ideal for the carnivorous <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants.</b> Bogs common to many [...] "flatwood" [...] longleaf areas are called [...] "wet prairies" [...] while other bogs found on hillsides are called [...] "seepage slopes". The transition from forest to an open bog is not immediate. Forests usually grade into a wetland bog habitat. This transition area is called an ecotone and hosts a rich variety of plant and animal species. [...] <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> have modified leaves shaped into hollow tubes (that look like a water pitcher), which attract insects. Downward pointing hairs and slippery walls make escape difficult and the insects are dissolved and digested by enzymes {{in the bottom of the}} <b>pitcher.</b> Other <b>plants</b> trap small insects on flat sticky leaves before slowly digesting them.Several types of <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> as well as other carnivorous plants grow in the longleaf pine ecosystem. Species include the hooded <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> trumpet <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> white-topped <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> and parrot <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant.</b> Other bog plants include colic-root; goldcrest; meadow-beauty (also called deerflower); white-topped sedge; orange milkwort (also called bog [...] "Cheetos" [...] because of their resemblance to that treat); bog-buttons (also called [...] "hatpins"); several species of orchids; and many other wildflowers. [...] Both soil moisture conditions and full sun are critical to these plants. Most of these bog plants have little shade tolerance. <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> bogs are fire dependent habitats. The frequent fires common to the longleaf ecosystem keep woody shrubs from encroaching on bogs. Without fire, moisture-loving shrubs invade drying up bogs and shading out the herbaceous plants.|$|R
