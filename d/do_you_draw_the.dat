Under direction of producer Richardson, From Autumn to Ashes' third full length album, Abandon Your Friends, was released on August 30, 2005. The album stemmed from the idea that [...] " [...] kind of...what we do. I mean, {{in the sense of}} how life goes on when we go away [...]" [...] Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up. Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions, despite stating in interviews that the album was [...] "a full on collaborative effort" [...] and [...] "We just all had a say in what we were writing." [...] It was revealed in 2007, in interviews, and when Mark posted in the band's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri's lyrics in a matter of days. The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums, and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals. CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album [...] "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band [...] "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's The Fiction We Live." [...] The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a [...] "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Abandon Your Friends produced one single, [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Draw</b> <b>The</b> Line?" [...] with an accompanying music video. Unhappy with intraband politics, guitarist Jonathan Cox quit the band.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{the official}} Comedy Central website included four deleted scenes from [...] "O Biclops Where Art Thou?". The first 75-second clip is an extended scene of Dongalor proposing to the Cute Girl, in which he discusses his empty heart and his [...] "empty bed...well, empty except for the concubines." [...] In the second clip, an extended scene of the hottub Truth or Dare? game, upon learning that Aneka slept with a troll who lost an eye in battle, an exasperated Kröd asks, [...] "Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line? Have you ever 69ed an orc? Teabagged an ogre? Tossed a hobgoblin's salad?" [...] In the third, two-minute clip, Kröd expresses excitement about being called before the Elite Resistance Council, and Aneka expresses anger {{that he wanted to}} go without her. When the two next appear before the council together, the elder Gustav the Short and Curly and Kröd gets into an argument over whether one should have pubic hair atop their heads. In the final, one-minute clip, Kröd expresses anger upon learning of the Pagan village attack: [...] "They can raid our villages, they can burn our crops, they can steal our cattle, but I refuse {{to live in a world}} where good men are shot in the anuses!" [...] Kröd and his friends then get into a discussion about how to pluralize anus before visiting the village.|$|E

To encourage research and facilitate comparisons, the IRAGE editors proposed {{a series of questions}} on methodology and theory to researchers who are currently engaged in, or have completed, studies on IVF. 1. What are the basic findings of your IVF research? 2. Provide details of your research methodology, for example, how many women were in your study? How was the sample obtained?

6000|$|Thus we may {{say that}} a {{permanent}} ideal is as necessary to the innovator as to the conservative; it is necessary whether we wish the king's orders to be promptly executed or whether we only wish the king to be promptly executed. The guillotine has many sins, but to do it justice there is nothing evolutionary about it. The favourite evolutionary argument finds its best answer in the axe. The Evolutionist says, [...] "Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line?" [...] the Revolutionist answers, [...] "I draw it HERE: exactly between your head and body." [...] There must {{at any given moment}} be an abstract right and wrong if any blow is to be struck; there must be something eternal {{if there is to be}} anything sudden. Therefore for all intelligible human purposes, for altering things or for keeping things as they are, for founding a system for ever, as in China, or for altering it every month as in the early French Revolution, it is equally necessary that the vision should be a fixed vision. This is our first requirement.|$|E

Why do governments want to censor it? Some of the motivation is understandable. With free speech comes troublesome speech. Even in a democracy such as Australia, most of society believes in limits to free speech. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> yourself <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> line? Even a staunch defender of civil liberties quickly runs into some thorny issues.

And I suspect you don't quite like your architecture so [...] "pure" [...] as this. We want a few mouldings, you will say--just a few. Those who want mouldings, hold up their hands.

As a result, we found the following. Subjects tended to draw graffiti simply when the spirit moved them, or when they had time. Graffiti was <b>drawn</b> in <b>the</b> blank spaces of a notebook or on any paper at hand. The subjects usually used a mechanical pencil or pencil to draw graffiti. Many subjects drew pictures of cartoon characters and animals, human faces and so on. The purpose of the graffiti was to kill time or to encourage a change of pace. A majority of subjects responded that they drew graffiti most frequently as a high school student. This was followed in order of frequency by junior high school student, elementary school student, undergraduate and finally infant. After puberty, the use of notebooks increased and there was an increase in subjects who described their motive in drawing graffiti as a diversion...|$|R
