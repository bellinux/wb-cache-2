5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could {{have no effect on}} <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata traces Prithu's lineage from Vishnu.The Almighty Vishnu {{created a}} human named Virajas {{to rule the}} <b>earth</b> <b>and</b> bring order to the Humans. Virajas lost his desire to rule the earth after beholding Vishnu and became an ascetic. Virajas' son was Krittimat, who became an ascetic. Krittimat's son was Kardama. Kardama's son was Ananga and Ananga's son was Atibala. Atibala, also called Anga, conquered the <b>earth</b> <b>and</b> ruled well. Atibala married Mrityu's daughter, Sunita and had a son named Vena. Vena's son would be Prithu.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Jupiter is {{relatively}} small: only 3.13°. As a result, {{it does not}} experience significant seasonal changes, in contrast to, for example, <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> Mars.|$|E

The output of Chadha’s plot (Fig.  5) is in confirmation with that of Piper trilinear diagram (Fig.  4) in that alkaline earths exceed alkali metals (field 1), strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (field 4) <b>and</b> alkaline <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (field 6).

5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou {{at this point is}} a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his efforts}} to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built– among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when {{threatened}} with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple <b>earth</b> <b>and</b> timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.|$|E
