5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca,</b> glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
25|$|After {{extensive}} research and data collection, Sjögren published an essential paper in 1951, describing 80 patients with <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca,</b> 50 of whom also had arthritis.

25|$|In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899–1986), an {{ophthalmologist}} in Jönköping, Sweden, {{observed a}} patient with low secretions from the lacrimal and salivary glands. Sjögren introduced the term <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> for the symptom of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, {{most of whom were}} postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren clarifies that <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca,</b> resulting from water deficiency, had no relation to xerophthalmia, resulting from vitamin A deficiency. Sjögren's thesis was not well received as the Board of Examiners criticized some clinical aspects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (dry eye) {{is common}} in dogs. Symptoms include eye redness, a yellow or greenish discharge, {{ulceration}} of the cornea, pigmented cornea, and blood vessels on the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis* is {{inflammation}} of the conjunctiva. In dogs it is most commonly caused by mechanical irritation (such as by entropion, ectropion, or trichiasis), allergies, and <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca.</b> Any bacterial infection is usually secondary.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcer, or {{ulcerative}} keratitis, is {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} cornea involving loss of its outer layer. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichia, corneal dystrophy, and <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin, also spelled {{cyclosporine}} and cyclosporin, is an immunosuppressant {{medication and}} natural product. It {{is used by}} mouth and injection into a vein for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, nephrotic syndrome, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (dry eyes).|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcers {{are one of}} {{the most}} common eye {{diseases}} in dogs. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichiae, corneal dystrophy, and <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (dry eye). There have been at least two cases where corneal ulceration was caused by canine herpesvirus.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{is known}} to cause meibomian gland {{dysfunction}} which causes persistent <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (dry eye). It has also been found to cause salivary gland dysfunction in some people, causing xerostomia (dry mouth). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of {{the cells of the}} exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some patients after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca,</b> which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is through}} direct {{observation}} of the ulcer {{with the use of}} fluorescein stain, which is taken up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green (see photos above and below). With descemetoceles, Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb the stain. Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{exhibits}} {{very poor}} solubility in water, and, as a consequence, suspension and emulsion {{forms of the}} drug {{have been developed for}} oral administration and for injection. Ciclosporin was originally brought to market by Sandoz, now Novartis, under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, as an oral solution, and as a formulation for intravenous administration. These are all nonaqueous compositions. A newer microemulsion, orally-administered formulation, Neoral, is available as a solution and as soft gelatin capsules (10mg, 25mg, 50mg and 100mg). The Neoral compositions are designed to form microemulsions in contact with water. Generic ciclosporin preparations have been marketed under various trade names, including Cicloral (Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (Abbott) and Deximune (Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (dry eye syndrome) has been marketed under the trade name Restasis (0.05%). Inhaled ciclosporin formulations are in clinical development, and include a solution in propylene glycol and liposome dispersions.|$|E
500|$|A {{disorder}} {{commonly found}} in Cavaliers is <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca,</b> colloquially known as [...] "dry eye". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness. This disorder can decrease or heal over time.|$|E
2500|$|FHV-1 {{also has}} a predilection for corneal epithelium, {{resulting}} in corneal ulcers, often pinpoint or dendritic in shape. [...] Other ocular signs of FHV-1 infection include conjunctivitis, keratitis, <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (decreased tear production), and corneal sequestra. [...] Infection of the nasolacrimal duct can result in chronic epiphora (excess tearing). [...] Ulcerative skin disease can also result from FHV-1 infection. [...] FHV-1 can also cause abortion in pregnant queens, usually at the sixth week of gestation, although {{this may be due}} to systemic effects of the infection rather than the virus directly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hallmark}} {{symptom of}} SS is a generalized dryness, typically including dry mouth and <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> (dry eyes), {{part of what}} are known as sicca ("dryness") symptoms. Sicca syndrome also incorporates vaginal dryness and chronic bronchitis. SS may cause skin, nose, and vaginal dryness, and may affect other organs of the body, including the muscles (myositis), kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, biliary system, pancreas, peripheral nervous system (distal axonal [...] neuropathy or small fiber peripheral neuropathy) and brain. Some people have gastrointestinal or esophageal diseases such as GERD, achlorhydria or gastroparesis. Chronic pain with accompanying fatigue and brain fog may also occur.|$|E

In addition, milder forms of <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> <b>sicca</b> also are more common in women. This is partly because hormonal changes, such as those that occur in pregnancy, menstruation, and menopause, can decrease tear production.|$|E
