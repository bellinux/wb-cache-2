50|$|While {{many other}} enzymes and metabolically active {{proteins}} do turn over eventually, the photoreceptors shed {{the ends of}} their outer segments daily. Each day about one tenth {{of the length of}} the outer segment is lost, so that after ten days the entire outer segment has been replaced. In a pulse-chase experiment, Young and his co-workers showed the migration of newly synthesized opsin from the ciliary stalk {{to the end of the}} outer segment, which is ultimately phagocytosed by the RPE cell. Regulating factors are involved at each step. While <b>disc</b> <b>assembly</b> is mostly genetically controlled, disc shedding and the subsequent RPE phagocytosis appear to be regulated by environmental factors like light and temperature.|$|E
40|$|Fretting fatigue is the {{phenomenon}} of combined contact and fatigue loads which may accelerate crack initiation and reduce the operational life of components. One of the most relevant problems of fretting fatigue occurs in the blade to <b>disc</b> <b>assemblies,</b> particularly those in the hot stages of gas turbines. The 'fir-tree' blade to <b>disc</b> <b>assemblies</b> in gas turbines operate at extreme conditions of loading and temperature, {{and the presence of}} multiple frictional contact points, often interacting with other stress concentrators, makes it an extremely challenging problems in solid mechanics.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 This paper {{describes}} a unique pumping concept {{based on a}} noncontact mechanism operating solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag. The first section focuses on the pumping technology itself, describing how the pump mechanism operates, while the second section examines how the pump functions in problem applications, such as handling abrasive, viscous, high solids, air-entrained, and shear sensitive fluids. The next section describes the pump operating and design characteristics, including information on the pump?s NPSH requirement and other standard pump performance data. The final section {{describes a}}nd end-user?s experience with the disc pump in an oil refinery application. The disc pump system operates solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag, two phenomena well-known in fluid engineering. Although superficially the disc pump looks like a centrifugal unit, it has no impeller in the traditional sense, and uses instead a series of parallel, rotating discs, referred to in this paper as the ?<b>disc</b> <b>assembly,?</b> to generate the energy necessary to move product. The key difference between the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly</b> and a standard centrifugal pump impeller is that, with the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly,</b> the pumpage does not impinge on the rotating pump mechanism, so that it generates a pulsation-free, laminar flow pattern through the pump. The disc pump can operate effectively in hard-to-pump applications because it lacks an ?impingement? device, which results in minimal contact between the pump and pumpage...|$|E

This paper discusses only the pressure locking phenomenon in a flexible-wedge gate valve; we will publish {{the results of our}} thermal binding research at a later date. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause the pressure of the fluid in the bonnet (and, in most valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly.</b> This high fluid pressure presses the discs against both seats, making the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly</b> harder to unseat than anticipated by the typical design calculations, which generally consider friction at only one of the two disc/seat interfaces. The high pressure of the bonnet fluid also changes the pressure distribution around the disc in a way that can further contribute to the unseating load. If the combined loads associated with pressure locking are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The results of the NRC/INEL research discussed in this paper show that the relationship between bonnet pressure and pressure locking stem loads appears linear. The results also show that for this valve, seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|E

Current models assume that c-FLIP directly competes with procaspase- 8 for recruitment to FADD. Using a functional reconstituted DISC, structure-guided mutagenesis, and quantitative LC-MS/MS, we show that c-FLIPL/S binding to the DISC is instead a co-operative procaspase- 8 -dependent process. FADD initially recruits procaspase- 8, which in turn recruits and heterodimerizes with c-FLIPL/S via a hierarchical binding mechanism. Procaspase- 8 activation is regulated by the ratio of unbound c-FLIPL/S to procaspase- 8, which determines composition of the procaspase- 8 :c-FLIPL/S heterodimer. Thus, procaspase- 8 :c-FLIPL exhibits localized enzymatic activity and is preferentially an activator, promoting DED-mediated procaspase- 8 oligomer assembly, whereas procaspase- 8 :c-FLIPS lacks activity and potently blocks procaspase- 8 activation. This co-operative hierarchical binding model explains the dual role of c-FLIPL and crucially defines how c-FLIP isoforms differentially control cell fate. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|E

For each realization of the random system parameters, a reduced system of equations is solved to compute the displacement vector for each frequency band of interest. Statistics of responses at each frequency point can be therefore estimated by performing Monte Carlo Simulations of cost comparable to single degree-of-freedom mass-spring systems. Second, a stochastic reduced basis approach is applied to the mistuning analysis problem. Here, the system response in the frequency domain is represented using a linear combination of complex stochastic basis vectors which span the preconditioned stochastic Krylov Subspace (2, 3). Orthogonal stochastic projection schemes are employed for computing the undetermined coefficients in the stochastic reduced basis representation. These schemes lead to explicit expressions for the response to be obtained, therby allowing the efficient computation of the response statistics...|$|R
