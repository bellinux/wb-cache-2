5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
25|$|The DeLorean solved these {{problems}} {{by using a}} solid-steel torsion bar (supplied by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation) to counterbalance a full-sized <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> used simple pneumatic struts {{similar to those found}} in hatchback cars to open the doors and damp their movement.|$|E
6000|$|Bartley {{closed the}} <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> {{with his hands}} in his pockets, confronted her with a smile of wicked coolness. [...] "Will you be good enough to tell me what you're talking about?" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she raised}} {{the letter to the}} light of the candle, Miss Fairlie turned from the balustrade, looked doubtfully up and down the terrace, {{advanced}} a step towards the glass <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> stopped, facing us.|$|R
30|$|We will {{restrict}} {{our analysis}} to this case, since lower values of α {{can be easily}} allowed by adding more <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> higher values {{can be obtained by}} adding more <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> opening more than one with goats. This general case follows in almost the same way.|$|R
25|$|Among {{those early}} {{students}} and friends were author and critic Mervyn Skipper, his wife Lena {{and their three}} children – Helen, Sonia and Matcham. Arthor Munday, George Charlmers, Lesley Sinclair, Sue Vanderkelen, Ian Robertson, Helen Lempriere, John Smith, John Busst and Myra Skipper. Percy Leason and his family lived next <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there were the many friends who came to join in the work and the camaraderie of the camp. Two notable Australian artists said to be associated with Montsalvat were Leonard French and Albert Tucker.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2008, Anthony Limon {{had agreed}} {{as a favor}} to Torres to drive four men in his Hummer {{limousine}} that night, picking up the first three and taking them to the Elephant Bar restaurant in suburban Lakewood, where they picked up Saenz. Later, he ordered Limon to drive to Montebello, then at 5 a.m. ordered him to drive to the limo owner's home in Whittier. Saenz was filmed on a home surveillance system arriving at Torres' house, chasing him out of his front <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shooting Torres four times in the head, possibly due to lost money. The DVD disc that had captured the shooting was removed from the surveillance system. However, shortly after the investigation of the homicide, video of the murder was retrieved from the security equipment's hard drive, leading investigators to identify Saenz as the shooter.|$|E
25|$|Jack Torrance {{arrives at}} the mountain-isolated Overlook Hotel, which is twenty-five miles from the closest town, {{to be interviewed for}} the {{position}} of winter caretaker. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. The hotel, built on the site of a Native American burial ground, becomes snowed-in during the winter; it is closed from October to May. Manager Stuart Ullman warns Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny Torrance, has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, viewing a cascade of blood emerging from an elevator <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> falls into a trance. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge.|$|E
60|$|So Phonny turned {{round and}} went away on tiptoe. When {{he got into}} the kitchen, he first shut the <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> carried the trap to Dorothy, and let her peep through the hole which the {{squirrel}} had gnawed and see the squirrel inside.|$|R
60|$|We {{heard him}} close the outer <b>door</b> <b>and</b> depart. <b>Then</b> I turned to Louis.|$|R
5000|$|When in October, 1944, Russian units {{temporarily}} entered Nemmersdorf, they tortured the civilians, specifically they nailed them to barn <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shot them. A {{large number}} of women were raped <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shot. During this massacre, the Russian soldiers also shot some fifty French prisoners of war. Within forty-eight hours the Germans re-occupied the area.|$|R
2500|$|A gifted salesman, Montague founded Gatehill Beco in 1958 aged 26 on an {{investment}} of £100, selling electric wire and later making cheap electric boiling rings: [...] "I {{used to make the}} goods, sell them, deliver them to the back <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> go round to the front to collect the money." [...] After he received a large order he could not fulfil himself, Montague sought out a large corporate, and eventually sold out to Valor in 1962, of which he then became a Director and then managing director.|$|E
2500|$|In many of {{his more}} humorous essays, Dijkstra {{described}} a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having commercialized the production of mathematical theorems {{in the same way}} that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs. [...] He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis but then had great difficulties collecting royalties from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a trade secret. Many of the company's proofs were rushed out the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> much of the company's effort had to be spent on maintenance. A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for Pythagoras' Theorem, that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs. Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as [...] "the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived". EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Maxson, who {{had been}} hired to replace Lamphere in February 1908, awoke {{in the early hours}} of April 28, 1908, smelling smoke in his room, which was on the second floor of the Gunness house. He opened the hall door to a sheet of flames. Maxson screamed Gunness' name and those of her {{children}} but got no response. He slammed the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> in his underwear, leapt from the second-story window of his room, barely surviving the fire that was closing in around him. He raced to town to get help, but by the time the old-fashioned hook-and-ladder arrived at the farm at early dawn, the farmhouse was a gutted heap of smoking ruins. Four bodies were found inside the house. [...] One of the bodies was that of a woman who could not immediately be identified as Gunness, since it had no head. The head was never found. The bodies of Gunness' children were found still in their beds. County Sheriff Smutzer had somehow heard about Lamphere’s alleged threats; he took one look at the carnage and quickly sought out the ex-handyman. Leliter came forward to recount his tale about Gunness' will and how she feared Lamphere would kill her and her family and burn her house down.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the great penny public were slowly growing restive, {{and at last}} the two little round men called on Pym to complain that he was falling off; and Pym turned them out of <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sat down heroically {{to do what he}} had not done for two decades--to read his latest work.|$|R
60|$|Once in the library, Tom Rover {{shut the}} <b>doors</b> tightly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> faced his twin sons.|$|R

60|$|Some {{more weight}} was thrown against the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> all was still.|$|E
60|$|He {{rose and}} left the room. De Cartienne watched the <b>door</b> close <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turned to me.|$|R
60|$|Mary Anna, at first, retreated {{outside of}} the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> stood there a moment, peeping in. Finding, however, that the {{squirrel}} remained very quiet {{in a corner of}} the room, she returned softly, and went round, and shut all the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Caleb went <b>and</b> called Raymond.|$|R
50|$|Players get {{to dig up}} dirt {{beneath the}} surface, find keys behind four <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> find the <b>door</b> to the next level. The most obvious game {{to compare it to}} is Dig Dug, but without the {{boulders}} and with various devices like teleporting <b>doors,</b> speed, dynamite, <b>and</b> a wet suit. There are 15 levels in the entire game; which repeat themselves after the 15th level is finished.|$|R
60|$|He manoeuvred {{the two men}} {{toward the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{prepared}} to follow them.|$|E

60|$|The Rector {{looked at}} her, {{but did not}} speak; then {{abruptly}} he brushed past her in the doorway, hurried into his study <b>and</b> locked the <b>door.</b> <b>Then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> only, he kneeled down, and remained there many minutes, thinking of nothing.|$|R
60|$|But at last Matt {{managed to}} reach the open <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he gave the horse a sharp cut on the flank, which sent him up the alley on a canter. The boy did not wait to {{ascertain}} how far Billy might continue on his way, but turned swiftly to help his partner, who was straining every nerve to budge the wagon from its resting-place.|$|R
60|$|And when at dawn, {{the great}} copper gates did slowly swing open, {{creaking}} upon their massive hinges, {{it was as}} if the flood-gates of a mighty sea had been suddenly let loose. In they poured, thousands upon thousands of them, scrambling, pushing and jumping, scurrying and hurrying, falling and tumbling, as they pressed onwards through the wide <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> dispersed in the vastness of the gigantic arena, like ants that scamper away to their heaps.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} shoved John Hopkins gently out the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> closed it.|$|E
60|$|Wonderingly Madeline {{inclined}} her head. The padre gently closed one <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the others.|$|E

60|$|His {{reading was}} {{interrupted}} by a loud knock at the street <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> he threw down the paper to be ready to receive the faithful Fraser. He heard the <b>door</b> open, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the violent rushing upstairs of Miss Chiffers to announce his visitor.|$|R
