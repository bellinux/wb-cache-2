25|$|Geometric matching/ shape {{complementarity}} methods {{describe the}} protein and ligand {{as a set}} of features that make them dockable. These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptor’s molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligand’s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands {{in a matter of seconds}} and actually <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> they can bind at the protein’s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany of today's {{software}} {{systems are}} built using distributed services, which evolve in different organizations.

A contract specifies interactions among a set of services from a global point of view. One important problem in a top-down development process is <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> such a contract can be implemented by a set of services, obtained by projection and communicating via message passing. It was only recently shown, that this problem, known as realizability, is decidable if asynchronous communication (communication via FIFO buffers) is considered. It can be verified using the synchronizability property. If the system is not synchronizable, the system is not realizable either. In this paper, we propose a new, automatic approach, which enforces both synchronizability and realizability by generating local monitors through successive equivalence checks and refinement...|$|R

The PFA device was introduced recently and measures closure time of capillary in a special cartridge. The measurement {{takes place in a}} whole blood sample. Aggregometer is used for stimulation of platelet aggregation by the inductors. The measurement takes place in platelet rich plasma.

It <b>figures</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> the results of the devices match and describes their advantages and disadvantages. The work leads to conclusion that is appropriate to use both devices for complementary results in the laboratory.

40|$|Whether {{people make}} the right choice when they vote for a given {{candidate}} or party and what factors affect the capacity to vote correctly have been recurrent questions in the political science literature. This paper contributes to this debate by looking at how {{the complexity of the}} electoral context affects voters’ capacity to vote correctly. Correct voting is defined as a vote that maximizes one’s payoffs in lab elections with monetary incentives. We examine two aspects of the electoral context: district magnitude and the distribution of preferences within the electorate. The main finding is that the frequency of correct voting is much higher in single-member than in multi-member district elections. As soon as {{there is more than one}} single seat to be allocated, voters have more difficulty <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> they should vote sincerely for their preferred party or opt strategically for another party in order to maximize their payoffs. By contrast, the distribution of preferences within the electorate has no significant effect. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
