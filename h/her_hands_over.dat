On Easter Sunday, 7April, her {{examining}} doctor stated that Soubirous, in ecstasy, was observed to have held <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> a lit candle without sustaining harm. On 16 July, Soubirous went for the last time to the Grotto. [...] "I have never seen her so beautiful before," [...] she reported.|$|E

60|$|Then {{holding up}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> {{his head as}} though in blessing, Asti, too, turned and left him.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{could bear}} it no longer. She pressed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> her burning ears, {{and the voices}} ceased to trouble her.|$|E
60|$|Louise {{smiled at}} him almost gratefully. She drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his, caressingly.|$|R

60|$|The saleslady clapped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{mouth and}} led the way to another model.|$|R

60|$|She {{took the}} pages, folded them and {{replaced}} them carefully in her pocket. She swept <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> her skirts, {{and turned to}} Danton.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ellison {{fell back}} upon her sofa as if shot, and placed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Stanhope passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow. Tom's blunt words {{did much}} to {{counteract}} Josiah Crabtree's strange influence over her.|$|R

60|$|Pelagia put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> her eyes, {{and burst}} into tears. Were they of pity or of joy?... She did not ask herself; {{and we will not}} ask her.|$|E
60|$|She locked <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> {{her eyes}} and groaned, swaying her body to and fro as one in mortal agony. Presently she looked out again with hard, dry eyes.|$|E
60|$|She hurried away, and I saw her {{afterwards}} seated {{amongst the}} bracken, her back turned towards the multitude, and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> her ears, cowering and wincing in an agony of apprehension.|$|E
