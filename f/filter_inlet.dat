Foreign matter will first settle on the filter surface. As fouling builds up, differential pressure between <b>filter</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet increases and the filter has to be cleaned by backwashing. For this purpose an electrically driven rotor covers the filter surface which is connected with a pipe leading outside. Installed in this pipe is a valve that is opened during the backwash process. The accumulated fouling is drawn off and discharged via the pipe which, downstream of the condenser, leads to the main cooling water pipe or a debris container. This technology was spread in power stations and industrial plants the world over. Depending on the flow rates to be filtered, the filters are produced in nominal diameters from 150 mm to DN 3200 mm. The filter surface consists of stainless steel with punched holes. For difficult types of debris, filter surfaces of plastic or [...] can be used.

A theoretical analysis of the filtration of massiveinclusions shows that there are two preponderant deposition mechanisms, i. e., direct interceptionand sedimentation, which explain qualitatively the effect of the operating conditions on themeasured filtration efficiency. Furthermore, it is observed that the filtration efficiency measuredby two Coulter counters reaches a minimum value for a diameter close to 30 µm.

The dependence of the resulting pressure drop, and hence the fuel consumption penalty, on the particulate matter distribution along the inlet channels is discussed in this paper taking as reference experimental data obtained in water injection tests before the particulate filter.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 The guiding {{question}} to this research is: To what extent and by what mechanisms do biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} contribute to atmospheric aerosol mass? To address this question {{we need to understand}} the chemistry that produces condensable vapors which when in the presence of particles may partition onto the aerosol surface depending on their chemical and physical properties. I developed an insitu gas and aerosol sampling system, the FIGAERO (<b>Filter</b> <b>Inlet</b> for Gases and AEROsol) to speciate gas and particle phase organics derived from photochemical reactions with biogenic volatile organic compounds under both field and laboratory conditions. By coupling the FIGAERO to a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (HR-TOF-CIMS) I am able to elucidate chemical pathways by identifying elemental compositions and in some cases functional groups present in the detected molecular ions. The coupling of the FIGAERO to the HR-TOF-CIMS also allows the estimation of effective vapor pressures of the aerosol components and this information can be used to improve vapor pressure models and test associated partitioning theories and parameterizations. The approach also provides hundreds of speciated chemical tracers that can be correlated with traditional environmental and chemical measurements (e. g AMS, NOx, SO 2, SMPS, VOC) to help derive sources and sinks and to constrain the mechanisms responsible for the formation and growth of organic aerosol.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of modified ultrafiltration (MUF) versus conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) on duration of mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic status in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 46 pediatric patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass throughout their congenital heart surgery.

These environmental concerns have resulted in the creation of more stringent particulate matter emissions regulations in the United States and European Union. These limits have forced diesel engine manufacturers to reduce particulate matter (PM) emissions by an order of magnitude beginning in 2007. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) provide the most effective means of reducing PM emissions from diesel exhaust. DPFs can reduce over 99 % of PM in the exhaust. DPF effectiveness is limited by the accumulation of ash. Ash is comprised of incombustible material from engine lubricants. Engine oil additives based on P, Zn, S, Ca, and Mg are responsible for the majority of ash. Ash accumulation in DPFs reduces their useful life by plugging the <b>filter's</b> <b>inlet</b> channels. Ash deposition leads to increased pressure drop across the DPF, which reduces the engine's performance and negatively impacts fuel economy. The process of ash accumulation in DPF channels is not well understood. This research is focused on exploring the ash interactions with DPF walls, pores, and the catalyst washcoat. Based on scanning electron microscopy analysis of ash loaded DPFs from the field and from filters loaded with ash in the laboratory, a mechanism for ash accumulation is presented. by Daniel P.

We focus here on results from experiments utilizing an ionization method most selective towards acids (acetate negative ion proton transfer), but our conclusions are based on more general {{physical and chemical properties}} of the SOA. Hundreds of compounds were observed in both gas and particle phases, the latter being detected by temperature-programmed thermal desorption of collected particles. Particulate organic compounds detected by the FIGAERO–HR-ToF-CIMS are highly correlated with, and explain at least 25 – 50 % of, the organic aerosol mass measured by an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). Reproducible multi-modal structures in the thermograms for individual compounds of a given elemental composition reveal a significant SOA mass contribution from high molecular weight organics and/or oligomers (i. e., multi-phase accretion reaction products). Approximately 50 % of the HR-ToF-CIMS particle-phase mass is associated with compounds having effective vapor pressures 4 or more orders of magnitude lower than commonly measured monoterpene oxidation products. The relative importance of these accretion-type and other extremely low volatility products appears to vary with photochemical conditions. We present a desorption-temperature-based framework for apportionment of thermogram signals into volatility bins.

Two instruments were <b>filter</b> <b>inlet</b> for gases and aerosols high-resolution chemical ionization mass spectrometers (FIGAERO-HRToF-CIMS) with acetate (A-CIMS) and iodide (I-CIMS) ionization sources, respectively; the third was a semi-volatile thermal desorption aerosol GC-MS (SV-TAG); and the fourth was a high-resolution thermal desorption proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer (HR-TD-PTRMS). Signals from these instruments corresponding to several organic acids were chosen for comparison. The campaign average partitioning fractions show good correlation. A similar level of agreement with partitioning theory is observed. Thus the intercomparison exercise shows promise for these new measurements, {{as well as some}} confidence on the measurement of low versus high particle-phase fractions. However, detailed comparison show several systematic differences that lie beyond estimated measurement errors. These differences may be due to at least eight different effects: (1) underestimation of uncertainties under low signal-to-noise; (2) inlet and/or instrument adsorption/desorption of gases; (3) differences in particle size ranges sampled; (4) differences in the methods used to quantify instrument backgrounds; (5) errors in high-resolution fitting of overlapping ion groups; (6) differences in the species included in each measurement due to different instrument sensitivities; and differences in (7) negative or (8) positive thermal decomposition (or ion fragmentation) artifacts. The available data are insufficient to conclusively identify the reasons, but evidence from these instruments and available data from an ion mobility spectrometer shows the particular importance of effects 6 – 8 in several cases.

In this study, the temperature of the filter was limited to 800 °C. Several variables affecting the performance of the filter were tested. Experiments at different gasification temperatures in the range 750 – 850 °C were performed so that the amount of tar reaching the catalytic filter was varied. The amount of tar at the catalytic <b>filter</b> <b>inlet</b> did not affect the tar conversion achieved which was around 75 %. The major tar compound in the gasification gas at the outlet of the catalytic filter was naphthalene. At the highest temperature tested (850 °C), the tar content in the clean gas was 0. 65 g/Nm 3. The effect of the face velocity in the filter on the tar conversion reached was evaluated. Tar conversion decreased when the face velocity increased from 40 to 90 m/h as the residence time of the gas in the catalytic filter was lower. The ratio H 2 O to dry biomass was also varied (0. 5 – 0. 9) in order to produce tars of different nature. Higher conversions were achieved for higher values of this ratio.

This work extends and complements previously successful studies on the treatment of medium to high turbidity raw waters using M. oleifera seed.;Laboratory studies using twin 100 mm diameter filter columns, were undertaken with the following variables: turbidities of 5 - 75 NTU; filtration rates of 5 - 20 m/h; filter depths of 70 and 120 cm; dual and single media beds, and media sizes of 0. 50 - 1. 00 mm and 0. 85 - 1. 70 mm. Deeper beds and smaller media were found to considerably reduce filtrate turbidity when using M. oleifera seed. The consequent headloss increase was only significant with the higher turbidity waters; dual media beds were most effective on such waters. Turbidity removal was reduced at higher filtration rates (10 m/h), due to lower retention times in the bed, and increased detachment of retained particles causing early turbidity breakthrough. Higher filtration rates with another natural coagulant, chitosan, increased turbidity removal and prolonged the time to breakthrough, due to the reduction in surface removal in the filter. At lower loading rates (5 NTU at 5 m/h), removal with M. oleifera seed was comparable with chitosan and aluminium sulphate, with the additional advantage of a lower headloss. Optimisation of the hydraulic variables for a specific coagulant was considered necessary to ensure maximum output and filtrate quality.;Field trials on a low turbidity natural raw water indicated that M. oleifera reduced the turbidity by > 95 % and bacterial numbers by 100 % at the optimum dose.

Currently, there are not sufficiently accurate models available to predict the filtered volume and outlet parameters for the sand filters used in micro-irrigation systems. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of the filtered volume and sand filter outlet values of dissolved oxygen (DO) and turbidity, both related to emitter clogging risks. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVMs) in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the main filtration operation parameters from data corresponding to 769 experimental filtration cycles in a sand filter operating with effluent. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. To this end, the most important physical-chemical parameters of this process are monitored and analyzed: effective sand media size, head loss across the filter and <b>filter</b> <b>inlet</b> values of dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, electrical conductivity (Ec), pH and water temperature. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each physical-chemical variables on the filtration is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting the filtered volume and sand filter outlet parameters is obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0. 74 for outlet turbidity, 0. 82 for filtered volume and 0. 97 for outlet dissolved oxygen were obtained when this hybrid PSO-SVM-based model was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latterAuthors wish to acknowledge the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness for its financial support of this study through Grant CGL 2012 - 31180 as well as the computational support provided by the Department of Mathematics at University of Ovied...|$|E

The UH-1C fuel capacity was increased to 242 US gallons (920 liters), and gross weight was raised to 9500 lb, giving a nominal useful load of 4673 lb. UH-1C production started in June 1966 with a total of 766 aircraft produced, including five for the Royal Australian Navy and five for Norway.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum {{production}} {{contributes to}} global CO 2 emissions both {{due to the}} production process itself and due to the generation of electric power required for aluminum production. A concept is presented for increasing the CO 2 concentration in the aluminum exhaust from ∼ 1 % to ∼ 5 % through the feeding of aluminum plant exhaust gas to a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC). The specific energy demand for CO 2 capture is therewith reduced for both the aluminum plant and the NGCC. An evaluation {{was made of the}} impact the aluminum exhaust gas may have on the gas turbine and it is estimated that the most critical issues are corrosion due to SO 2 in the aluminum plant exhaust gas and gas turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>filter</b> saturation, since the exhaust gas is saturated with seawater after the wet scrubber. A gas turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>filter</b> was tested for a period of five weeks, but a longer filter test period would be required for verifying filter integrity over time. In order to proceed, the viability of the concept should be evaluated by a gas turbine manufacturer. An alternative concept to evaluate for concentration of CO 2 emissions could be to feed the aluminum plant exhaust gas to a boiler in a steam power plant...|$|R
25|$|While small {{generators}} may be cooled by air {{drawn through}} <b>filters</b> at the <b>inlet,</b> larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. Hydrogen gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used {{because it has}} the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly flammable hydrogen does not mix with oxygen in the air.|$|R
