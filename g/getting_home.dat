25|$|On 15 August 1974, Court Line went bankrupt, {{with all}} flights cancelled, its fleet {{comprising}} two TriStars and nine One-Eleven 500s grounded, all 1,150 staff {{losing their jobs}} {{and as many as}} 49,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas with no means of <b>getting</b> <b>home.</b> To enable stranded holidaymakers to return to the UK at no additional cost to them, the collapsed group's rivals organised an airlift through the Tour Operators' Study Group (TOSG), the package holiday industry association. This operation was paid for using the £3.5m bond the failed group's tour operators had deposited with TOSG.|$|E
25|$|The Step Up {{campaign}} {{is a program}} that helps students prevent crimes, sexual assault, and excessive drinking by teaching students how to intervene and prevent in a positive way. They do this by explaining the Bystander effect. The U of M also has a TXT-U emergency notification text messaging system that sends out a notification to all faculty, staff, and students in case of emergency. Similarly, there are different resources which {{students are able to}} get help while <b>getting</b> <b>home.</b> 624-WALK, an escort to walk to adjacent campuses and neighborhoods, and Gopher Chauffeur, a van service that offers rides near and on campus. Both of these are free and open to all students, staff, and faculty.|$|E

25|$|As Swigert and Haise {{watch the}} Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their {{attention}} to the business of <b>getting</b> <b>home.</b> With Aquarius running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and a fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.|$|E
25|$|In total 93 Americans and 58 Canadiens prisoners from Lower Canada {{were transported}} to Australia after being convicted in Montreal in late 1838 or early 1839. Almost all were {{taken on the}} HMS Buffalo, leaving Quebec in September 1839 and {{arriving}} off Hobart, Van Diemen's Land in February 1840. The Americans were disembarked at Hobart but the French-Canadians were taken to Sydney, New South Wales. They were interned near the present day suburb of Concord, giving rise to the names Canada Bay, France Bay and Exile Bay. The French-Canadians were treated better than the Americans, liberated sooner and assisted in <b>getting</b> <b>home.</b> Of the 93 Americans, 14 died {{as a direct result}} of transportation and penal servitude. By the end of 1844, half of those in Van Diemen's Land had been granted pardons, nearly all were pardoned by 1848, but five remained in penal servitude until at least 1850. None chose to stay in Van Diemen's Land after being pardoned.|$|E
25|$|A student-formed {{group at}} the University of Virginia called “Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Team” (ADAPT) {{partners}} {{with a number of}} groups to promote protective drinking behavior and safe transportation options at the Foxfield Races. The group has coordinated student education programs at UVA to inform students how to minimize the risks of drinking and provide alternatives for <b>getting</b> <b>home.</b> In the past, the program has been held as a panel discussion made up of ADAPT members, the Foxfield Racing Association, local police and Alcoholic Beverage Control agents, the local commonwealth’s Attorney, the Rescue Squad, and the UVA Dean of Students. The Foxfield Racing Association funds a non-drinking driver program called “The Savvy Fox”. This program is administered by ADAPT. If a patron signs the Savvy Fox Pledge at the race meet, thy agree to be a Designated Driver and not drink all day, and receive a coupon for lunch and free non-alcoholic drinks.

But they had sixteen miles to go before they would reach the Boy's Town, and the carriage had been so badly shattered, or else the driver was so much afraid of the horses, {{that he would not}} let them go at more than a walk.

25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> to her flat ... I {{have no idea of}} the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and <b>getting</b> <b>home,</b> she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who tell you that they are your family. But you feel nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Alcohol Myopia Model {{proposes that}} {{intoxication}} {{increases the likelihood}} that an individual will decide to drive in an unsafe situation. The drinker is unable to properly weigh the future consequences of his or her decision to drive; “inhibitory cues that prohibit driving {{are less likely to be}} considered because they lack salience and immediacy." [...] Meanwhile, the intoxicated individual responds to the immediate motivations to drive. For example, he will focus on the rewards of <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> quickly and not having to pay for a cab. Therefore, under the influence of alcohol, driving becomes the simplest and most compelling option. Studies show that when questioned, intoxicated individuals reported “greater intentions to drink and drive...and fewer moral obligations against drinking and driving” than they did when sober.|$|E
