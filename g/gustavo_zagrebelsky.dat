25|$|Had {{the voters}} {{approved}} the constitutional law, {{it would have}} achieved the most extensive constitutional reform in Italy {{since the end of}} the monarchy, not only influencing the organization of the Parliament, but also improving, according to its proponents, on the poor government stability of the country. Opposition parties and well-known jurists (such as <b>Gustavo</b> <b>Zagrebelsky</b> and Stefano Rodotà) harshly criticised the bill, claiming that it was poorly written and would have made the government too powerful.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{increasingly}} rapid {{evolution of the}} legal system it becomes essential, for the jurist, to query which today’s sources of the legal production are: therefore, aim {{of this study is to}} understand, in a wider perspective, what currently falls into the category of positivity. The latter has necessarily to be thought again compared to the classical formulation of the legal positivism according to which law corresponded to what had been ruled by the legislator: the analysis of some examples of new sources of law, including jurisprudence, the new lex mercatoria and the so-called intermediate societies, which will be specifically examined, demonstrates, as a matter of fact, that this idea results more appropriate to explain the legal reality. This inadequacy emerges also with reference to the formalistic approach that characterizes this conception: in this regard, it will be led a criticism of the ethical non-cognitivism in order to prove that the fact/value dichotomy is a concept by now passed. Considered that, we will try to identify a philosophy of law theory which could justify the issues raised: therefore it will be first considered the legal realism, which has the virtue to result more adherent to current legal reality, maintaining however the limit of a value-free approach. A more satisfactory answer to the many questions that emerged can then be found in the neoconstitutionalist doctrine, and particularly in the work of authors such as Ronald Dworkin, Robert Alexy e <b>Gustavo</b> <b>Zagrebelsky.</b> At the end of this study there will still be many questions, but with the awareness of the uncertainty that characterizes the current structure of the sources of law and the need of a greater commitment of the jurists in understanding what the law is today...|$|E
