5000|$|<b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge: Named {{because a}} {{biological}} study by Pat Martin and Ralph Ritcey was conducted there in 1952.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge is a {{mountain}} ridge in east-central British Columbia, Canada, located just southwest of Battle Mountain at the southeastern end of Wells Gray Provincial Park.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Naming== <b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge {{has only}} been called that since 1952 when a {{biological}} study was conducted here by Ralph Ritcey and Pat Martin. The name has many different versions such as Fifty Two Ridge, Fifty-Two Ridge and 52 Ridge, but the correct spelling according to BC Geographical Names is one word, <b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge. As early as 1935, it was known as Bull Ridge and the valley between it and Battle Mountain was called Bull Valley. Clearwater Valley ranchers Laurence and Charlie Ludtke often guided big-game hunters into these meadows, {{in search of the}} prized bull caribou.|$|E
50|$|Battle Mountain is {{accessible}} {{by a combination}} of road and trail. It is a popular summer tourist attraction and is especially noted for colourful alpine meadows. The access trail is longer and more strenuous than the one to nearby Trophy Mountain to the south, so fewer people visit Battle Mountain and the Caribou Meadows. The hike to the meadows can be accomplished as a day outing, but hikers who want to attain <b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge and Battle Mountain summit should plan for two days and carry overnight equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge is a {{volcanic}} feature {{associated with the}} Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. It is a subglacial volcano that formed in the Pleistocene epoch when this area was buried beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Quaternary glaciation. The eruptions melted the ice, so the hot magma contacted with water and caused violent explosions. About 20 small craters can be found today. Some contain fine examples of scoria, an extraordinarily light-weight rock with numerous air-holes. When hiking here early in summer, some of the craters may be filled with runoff water (called maars) and are less obvious.|$|E
5000|$|A well-used trail starts here. The {{first section}} is the steepest and climbs 248 m in 2.1 km up the canyon of Philip Creek to a hanging valley where Philip Lake is located. Then it {{continues}} at an easier grade, ascending 170 m {{to the beginning}} of the Caribou Meadows. The trail meanders through the meadows, along the west shore of Fight Lake, then climbs to the top of <b>Fiftytwo</b> Ridge. Beyond there, it is a hiking route through meadows and rock which first descends into Bull Valley, then climbs onto Battle Mountain itself. The hiking season on Battle Mountain is from late June through September.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The ideal bowel {{preparation}} for colonoscopy must combine {{the characteristics of}} effectiveness with the least side effects. We compared the relatively novel cathartic preparation of sodium phosphate salts (Fleet Phospho-sodaR) with the widely used PEG-electrolytes solution (Klean-prepR). <b>Fiftytwo</b> consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy were randomised to receive either sodium phospate salts or PEG electrolytes. The evaluation of the two preparations was based on two separate questionnaires, one completed by the endoscopist who ignored the kind of bowel preparation used and the other by the patient. Bowel preparation with sodium phospate salts was more effective in bowel cleansing and better tolerated than PEG-electrolytes solution in terms of difficulty in intake and swallowing, fatigue, the presence of colicky abdominal pain, flatulence, vomiting and perianal irritation (p< 0, 05). Key words: cathartic preparation, PEG-electrolytes, sodium phosphate salt...|$|E
40|$|Background Obesity {{has become}} a major health problem globally, indicates as an {{epidemic}} problem by World Health Organization (WHO). Adiposity rebound period may represent critical period for the development of adiposity. Recent data suggest that, in industrialized countries, people of low socioeconomic group are more likely to be obese than their high socioeconomic counterparts. Level of serum leptin was reported to be higher in obese subjects. There has been lack of data regarding leptin serum level in Indonesian obese children. Objective This study aimed to investigate leptin serum level in low socioeconomic obese children.   Methods This was a cross sectional study perfonned in Tuminting District, Manado. Obesity was defined based on body mass index for AsiaPacific condition, i. e., grade I obesity (BMI 25 / 29. 9 kg/ mL), grade II (BM] 30 - 40 kg/ml), and grade III (BM] > 40 kg/m 2  Low socioeconomic status was detennined based on Government's program Cash Direct Aid Program. loBod sample was obtained from inclusion subjects, consisted of leptin serum.

40|$|In {{the decade}} prior to China joining the World Trade Organization in December 2001, Chinese {{television}} producers began to measure success and failure, {{not so much}} from a political yardstick, but in comparison to market expectations. Foreign programs were feeding into the system, finding enthusiastic audiences, and challenging the style of local production. By 2001, moreover, the technological possibilities of the medium were becoming increasingly evident. Digital channels, multi-platform programming, new formats, niche channels and short message service (SMS) interactivity were creating new demands for more programming and greater variety. However, despite an increase in formats and genres - including reality TV, quiz, and game shows - drama has retained pre-eminence in viewing schedules. Research estimates that the "Chinese viewer" watches an average of <b>fiftytwo</b> minutes of television drama per day - a diet constituting more than 30 percent of overall television consumption. The status of television drama is reflected in advertising: in 2002, 90 percent of all revenue from television advertising came from television drama. 1 Although drama's domination of advertising is now challenged by reality and "factual" television formats, drama production remains central to the viability of China's large but fragmented television industry...|$|E
40|$|National Park (NW Italy), using Capture-Mark-Recapture techniques. According to a sam-ple of data {{collected}} in August, the following percentages {{were found for}} the genus Apodemus: 25. 9 % of the individuals caught in alder shrubwoods, 20. 9 % in hardwoods, 12. 1 % in open habitat-types and 3. 1 % in coniferous woods. Further trapping, carried out in winter in the villages inside the Park, demonstrated that Apodemus occurrence inside the buildings was quite common. <b>Fiftytwo</b> specimens were sacrificed and identified by protein electrophoresis and/or mole-cular analyses as A. alpicola (N = 14), A. flavicollis (N = 21) and A. sylvaticus (N = 17). External morphology and biometric parameters were analysed on the above specimens, as were cranial features, {{and the effectiveness of}} the determination technique proposed by Reutter et al. on the study area material was verified. This technique enabled us to determi-ne other specimens (mainly from discarded bottles) using skull analysis. A. flavicollis (recorded from the lowest altitude of the area, 750 m, up to 2123 m a. s. l.) dominated in hardwoods.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to be {{informed}} about demographic features, the reasons for preferring medical oncology, career plans, and the educational problems of the residents training in the subspecialty of medical oncology. Method: The responses to questionnaire forms sent by e-mail to subspecialty residents who are continuing their training in different educational institutions of our country were recorded and analyzed. Results: Seventynine of 129 residents (61. 2 %) responded the survey forms. Median age of the participants was 33 years. Thirty six (45. 5 %) were female, and 43 (54. 5 %) were male. The responders stated different reasons for their preference of medical oncology but most of them (n: 64, 81 %) thought that medical oncology has a bright future. Of them, 38 (48. 1 %) the responders intended to refrain from their medical conscription was their most important concern. <b>Fiftytwo</b> (65. 8 %) of them were not satisfied much with their present education and academic activities. Sixtynine (87. 3 %) of the participants indicated that they had been suffering from the symptoms of burnout syndrome. Conclusion: Recognition of the subspecialty residents who are the future of medical oncology, and determination of their needs, and problems will contribute to the development of recommendations for their solution. In our country their main problems are medical conscription, inadequate education, and burnout...|$|E
40|$|Background - This study {{examined}} the effects of a universal stress management program (Learn Young, Learn Fair) on stress, coping, anxiety and depression in fifth and sixth grade children. Methods - <b>Fiftytwo</b> schools (1467 children) participated in a clustered randomized controlled trial. Data was collected in the fall of 2002, the spring of 2003, and the winter of 2004. Given the nested structure of the design mixed (multilevel) regression analyses were applied. Results - Positive effects were found for emotionfocused coping at posttest (p <. 01) and increased stress awareness at both time points. At posttest a decrease in problem solving was found (p <. 01). After correcting for mediation by stress awareness the results showed that the program significantly reduced stress symptoms (p =. 05) and anxiety (p =. 01) at posttest. Effect sizes varied from small to large. Conclusions - Universal prevention programs that address stress and coping in children are warranted given the high prevalence of stress in children and the relationship between stress, on the one hand, and health complaints and pathology, on the other. Such programs are expected to be particularly salient for children with an increased sensitivity to stress and inadequate coping styles (e. g., diathesis-stress model). The results indicate that the school-based program 'Learn Young, Learn Fair' may be a valuable program for reducing stress in children...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to establish employee satisfaction {{as an important}} KPI in telemarketing. A multi-method data collection was adopted to collect primary and secondary data for this study. Primary data was collected by the researcher as an employee of Company Y. This was done through informal talks with management and employees. Secondary data was collected through company questionnaires. The objectives of this study included the following: 1) to demonstrate the importance of employee satisfaction as a vital KPI tool in telemarketing, 2) to establish the relationship between employee-management relations through training, employee motivation, employee commitment, and employee satisfaction, 3) to measure these elements in Company Y, and 4) to provide recommendations on improving employee satisfaction levels within Company Y. Secondary data was collected from a sample of fifty-two questionnaires obtained from Company Y. The sample audience consisted of thirty-three men and nineteen women {{with a mean age}} of 21. 42 years. Of the seventy-eight employees in the workforce, <b>fiftytwo</b> completed them, yielding a response rate of 66. 7 %. Participants were all current CSRs (Customer Service Representatives) in the month of February 2005. The external analysis consisted of an environmental scan, a competitive analysis, and a discussion of Company Y’s opportunities and threats. The internal analysis included a discussion of Company Y’s business profile, its management, and its strengths and weaknesses. Employee-management relations were established as the most important element behind employee satisfaction in Company Y.

40|$|Personality {{traits and}} {{personal}} values are two important domains of individual differences. Traits are enduring and distinguishable patterns of behaviour whereas values are societally taught, stable, individual preferences that guide behaviour {{in order to}} reach a specific end state. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the relations between self and peer report within the domains of personality traits and values, to examine the correlations between values and traits, and to explore the amount of incremental validity of traits and values in predicting behaviour. Two hundred and <b>fiftytwo</b> men and women from a university setting completed self and peer reports on three questionnaires. In order to assess personality traits, the HEXACO-PI (Lee & Ashton, 2004) was used to identify levels of 6 major dimensions of personality in participants. To assess values, the Schwartz Value Survey (Schwartz, 1992) was used to identify the importance each participant placed on each of Schwartz's 10 value types. To measure behaviour, a Behavior Scale, created by Bardi and Schwartz (2003), consisting of items designed to measure the frequency of value-expressive behaviour was used. As expected, correlations between self and peer reports for the personality scales were high indicating that personality traits are easily observable to other people. Correlations between self and peer reports for the values and behaviour scales were only moderate, suggesting that some goals, and behaviours expressive of those goals, may not always be observable to others. Consistent with previous research, there were many strong correlations between traits and values. In addition to the similarities with past research, the present study found that the personality factor Honesty-Humility was correlated strongly with values scales (with five correlations exceeding. 25). In the prediction of behaviour, it was found that both personahty and values were able to account for significant and similar amounts of variance. Personality outpredicted values for some behaviours, but the opposite was true of other behaviours. Each domain provided incremental validity beyond the other domain. The impUcations for these findings, along with limitations, and possibilities for future research are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Learning English {{language}} {{has become a}} challenge to students in Malaysia in learning the language well. Learners' attitude and motivation are identified to play essential roles to ensure that students are able to learn English language well because both factors contribute to students' desire in learning the language, as well as improving their achievement in the language. Thus, a study needs to be carried out to determine Form Five students' attitude and motivation in learning English language as a second language. A survey was carried out using a questionnaire distributed to <b>fiftytwo</b> average proficiency level students of Form Five in a secondary school in Shah Alam, Selangor. Interviews were also conducted with five students selected at random. In relation to RQ 1, this study was to identify students' attitude towards learning English as a second language. The study revealed that the students generally have positive attitudes in learning English language as a second language as the mean score for positive attitude is above 4. 00 compared to the mean score obtained for negative attitude is below 3. 00. RQ 2 was to identify the intrinsic motivation in learning English as a second language. The results revealed that students have strong desire to learn English due to intrinsic reasons such as for self-development and to be at ease with English speakers. In addition, RQ 3 {{of this study was to}} identify the extrinsic motivation in learning English as a second language. For the extrinsic motivation, students learn English language to get a good job and also do well in examination. RQ 4 was to identify other factors that motivate students in learning English as a second language. The finding indicated that obtaining good grade and passing examinations are the reasons given. RQ 5 was to identify language activities that motivate students in English classroom. The findings indicated that students prefer to learn English language through language activities. There are three suggested activities, such as Role Play, Chinese Whispering and Pretending to be Someone that can be used in the English classroom because it is fun and they can learn better through interactive activities. In order to get a better perspective of students' attitude and motivation in learning English language as a second language, it is recommended that a bigger pool of respondents from all levels of proficiency levels among Form Five students from a bigger number of secondary schools in Malaysia be carried out in the future to ensure that the results are applicable and can be generalized to a larger population...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The age of {{the women}} is a known {{significant}} factor that diminishes the ovarian reserves which are depleted completely at menopause. Although, pituitary sensitivity to GnRH is reduced with aging after menopause, data in premenopausal women are scanty. Smoking {{has been shown to}} reduce ovarian reserves in subfertile women. However, the effect smoking may have on the ovarian reserves of normal, fertile women has not been appriopriately studied as yet. Furthermore, whether smoking affects the pituitary sensitivity to GnRH in normal, fertile women has not been studied so far. Aim of the study: The aim {{of the present study was}} the investigation of the effects of age and smoking on ovarian reserves and the pituitary function in healthy, fertile, normally cycling women. Materials and methods: One hundred and <b>fiftytwo</b> healthy, fertile, normally cyckling women, with history of delivery of at least one neonate, were included in the present study. In all women, an indwelling catheter was introduced on day 3 of their spontaneous cycle and blood samples were obtained. In all women a sinlge injection of GnRH, at the dose of 10 μg was given. Blood samples in relation to the injection of GnRH (time 0) were taken at - 15, 0 and 30 min. in all blood samples (serum), FSH and LH were measured. The LH response to GnRH was calculated as the net increase of LH levels at 30 min (ΔLH) above the basal levels (mean value of LH values at - 15 and 0 min). in all blood samples taken at time 0 the levels of estradiol (E 2), progesterone, inhibin B and antimullerian hormone (AMH) were measured. For the statistical analysis of the data, t-test, Pearson’s correlation and linear regression analysis were performed. Results: In all women, the age had a positive correlation with the basal levels of FSH and LH and a negative correlation with the levels of inhibin B and ΑΜΗ. The LH response to GnRH (ΔLH) (in vivo bioassay of GnSAF bioactivity) was significantly higher in smokers as compared to non-smokers. In terms of FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone and AMH there were no differences between smokers and non-smokers, whether the comparisons were performed for women 37 years. It was found that only in women < 37 years, smokers had higher ΔLH and lower inhibin B values as compared to non-smokers. Conclusions: The increase of the age is related to significant reduction of ovarian reserves in healthy, fertile, normally cycling women. Smoking has probably a negative effect on the production of non steroidal ovarian factors (inhibin B and GnSAF) in younger women (< 37 years), while the total pool of primary follicles (circulatory ΑΜΗ value) and steroidogenesis are not significantly affected. ...|$|E
40|$|More than 5, 500 carapaces, {{valves and}} {{fragments}} of ostracods, were extracted from 48 samples {{collected in the}} stratotype of the Terres d'Haurs Formation (= Fm) and in the very base of the stratotype of the Mont d'Haurs Fm, at the Mont d'Haurs, close to Givet. <b>Fiftytwo</b> species belonging to several assemblages of the Eifelian MegaAssemblage have been identified. They are generally indicative of neritic marine environments below fair-weather wave base, some even below storm wave base. Ostracods indicative of semi-restricted environments are also present but the sedimentological analysis displays that these ostracods have been mainly transported from these shallow settings. Close to the boundary of the Terres d'Haurs Fm and the Mont d'Haurs Fm, thick-shelled ostracods indicate that {{the energy of the}} environment increased. The richness in ostracods and their great diversity in the two studied sections prove that the living conditions were particularly favourable for these crustaceans. Ten microfacies are recognized, the succession of which (from 1 to 10) constitutes a standard shallowing upward sequence, with environments ranging from open marine, near storm wave base, to coastal, close to subaerial exposure. The microfacies analysis points to a carbonate ramp system with oolitic shoals and algal shoals separating semi-restricted and coastal areas from the open marine environment. Storm events and those related to the wave activity redistributed many organisms, which formed diversified communities with abundant echinoderms, bryozoans, molluscs and brachiopods in the peri-shoal environments. The lithological curve reflects a progessive and transgressive evolution in two phases marked by two parasequence sets: the first set records the destabilization of the overlain carbonate platform (Trois-Fontaines Fm) leading to the establishment of a shallow "open lagoon" in the inner ramp, the second set corresponds to the development of several shoals at the inner-mid ramp zones. No important reefal episode is present and shoals are of modest relief. The salinity and energy were the key parameters controlling the zonation of the organisms and the distribution of the environments. Low-field magnetic susceptibility (XLF) values are weak and eight magnetic susceptibility evolutions are reported along the lithological column. The magnetic susceptibility and microfacies curves are more or less mimetic in {{the lower half of the}} section and opposite in the upper part of the Terres d'Haurs Fm. A significant decreasing trend of the low-field magnetic susceptibility values across the boundary between the Terres d'Haurs Fm and the Mont d'Haurs Fm is presented. Two linear regression models show a moderately positive correlation between XLF values and microfacies in the lower half of the section and a moderately strong negative correlation between these two parameters in the upper part of the Terres d'Haurs Fm. The water agitation is highest in the mid and inner ramp, associated to the oolite and algal shoal environments and corresponds to the lowest mean XLF values presented in the models. The lower half of the section corresponds more to a carbonate platform profile in opposition to the second model, which confirm the carbonate ramp morphology. The average XLF values in the upper part of the Terres d'Haurs Fm are more homogeneous compared to those reported in the lower half of the Terres d'Haurs Fm. High-resolution stratigraphie correlation for the base of the Mont d'Haurs Fm in Belgium and France is proposed due to similar XLFdata established in the "Les Monts de Baileux" section 40 km distant from the stratotype area.
