For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an employer not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee {{based on their}} gender. [...] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women. This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for systemic bias. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia. In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender. [...] As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, {{there are two types}} of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but <b>indirect</b> <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination,</b> where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'. Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.|$|E
40|$|The {{prospect}} of a justification defence in cases of direct sex discrimination is universally criticised by academic commentators {{on the ground that}} it would subvert the goal of equality that underlies sex discrimination and equal treatment legislation. At the outset the thesis examines the differences between the sexes, how these differences can be used to explain the distinction between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> and considers various concepts of equality. Building on various elements of the existing justification defences for <b>indirect</b> <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> and disability discrimination, this thesis constructs a model justification defence. The impact on equality of such a defence is assessed by reference to the main existing legislative exceptions for direct sex discrimination and various judicial exceptions that have been created, in the main, by the European Court of Justice. Further, the thesis considers whether the blanket prohibition against the use of sex stereotypes is warranted {{and the extent to which}} they might be permitted under the model defence. The conclusions reached are that criticism of the potential defence is overstated. Rather than undermining the goal of sex equality, such a defence could in fact enhance the degree of legal protection as long as the criteria of the defence are stringently drawn. Indeed, in relation to some areas of direct sex discrimination, for example pregnancy and maternity, the introduction of such a defence could enhance the degree of equality. Moreover, the introduction of such a defence could introduce a greater degree of openness and clarity into this complex area of law...|$|E
40|$|Sex {{equality}} law {{within the}} European Union is well developed {{and has since}} the Rome Treaty, given rise to several directives and other judicial acts on this matter of community law. The concepts of direct and indirect discrimination emerge from the general principles of Equal pay and Equal treatment and have been codified and amended several times until present. The lasts years, authors {{within the field of}} Equality Law has been pointing out that there is a common desire for simplification of discrimination law in Europe. The question has arisen whether this simplification could be implemented trough the introduction of a general justification defence for direct sex discrimination. The concept of direct sex discrimination - when a person of one gender is treated less favourably, on the grounds of gender, than a person of the other gender would be treated in similar circumstances - leaves no possibilities for such justification today. <b>Indirect</b> <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> – which arises from the equal application of neutral rules that shows an adverse impact on one group – can be justified if the rule answers to true requirements of the job. Does the proposition that direct discrimination should be justified find support in the inconsistency of the present legislation? This paper will examine this and other questions concerning the wish for a general justification defence through studies of case law from the European Court of Justice as well as differing opinions from authors within the field of equality law...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> law has {{not kept}} pace with the lived {{experience}} of discrimination. In {{the early years of}} Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, courts settled on an idea of what <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> looks like—formal practices that exclude employees based on their group membership. The problem is that <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> has become highly individualized. Modern <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> does not target all men or all women, nor does it target subgroups of men or women. The victims of modern <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> are particular men and women who face discrimination because they do not or cannot conform to the norms of the workplace. These employees have been shut out of a <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> regime that still expects employees to anchor their claims to a narrative of group subordination. I argue that the lived experience of discrimination should determine employment discrimination doctrine and not the other way around. Accordingly, I propose a new regime for <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> law. The model for the new <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> regime is religious discrimination law. Unlike other areas of employment discrimination law, religious discrimination law offers a dynamic conception of identity and a greater array of different theories of discrimination. I argue that <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> law can and should work this way, too. On a broader level, the paper makes a strong normative claim about the substance of Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s sex equality project. I argue that <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> law needs to recalibrate its vision of equality. Difference is universal. No two women (or men) are the same, and this is a good thing. Thus the central task of <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> law should be to better recognize—and, in turn, protect—the distinctive ways in which employees express their maleness and femaleness. It is these differences, after all, that shape the way employees experience modern <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>Discrimination</b> Ordinance (SDO) for {{organizations}} {{within the}} area of employment relationship was inevitable and it may bring a sequential issue to the organizations. Numerous literature {{has pointed out that}} having an effective planned policy {{is the best way to}} deal with the <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> problem. This can help maintain a fair view of employment and improve efficiency in recruiting the most suitable person for the banks. The objective of this study is to examine if license d banks in Hong Kong have done enough to combat <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> problems in their working environment. According to the questionnaire to the Human Resources Managers as well as another questionnaire to the staff of licensed banks in Hong Kong, we found that most of the licensed banks in Hong Kong had not made enough efforts on dealing with this issue. They had not yet realized the important of taking a proactive approach to prevent the problem because they were still not familiar with its negative impacts. There were quite passive in responding to this new challenge. Even those licensed banks which had already established their <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> policies could not demonstrate good practice in dealing with this problems. There were many apparent defects in their <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> policy regarding the completeness of contents and the implementation of the policy. Licensed banks are advised to pay close attention to the issue and establish an appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> policy. We have finally put forward our recommendations in four aspects to help licensed banks formulate an effective <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> policy. They are: (1) Support from top management, (2) Written <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> policy in recruitment and selection process, (3) Investigation of <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> policy, (4) Training and education...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} survey-based {{reports of}} sexual harassment and <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{in order to identify}} the stylized facts {{about the nature of the}} relationship between them. In particular, we are interested in assessing whether these concepts measure similar forms of gender-biased behavior and whether they have the same effect on workers' job satisfaction and intentions to leave their jobs. Our results provide little support for the notion that survey-based measures {{of sexual harassment}} and <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> capture the same underlying behavior. Respondents do appear to differentiate between incidents of sexual harassment and incidents of <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace. There are gender differences in the consequences, however. Both <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> and sexual harassment are associated with a higher degree of job dissatisfaction. However, women's intended job changes appear to be more sensitive to experiencing <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination,</b> while men's are more sensitive to experiencing sexual harassment. Although exploratory, when taken together these results give us hope that in the future sufficiently detailed surveys could provide a useful foundation for quantifying the link between sexual harassment and <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination.</b> They also suggest that the best prospect for developing [...] and then testing [...] a conceptual framework of gender bias lies in adopting a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating the insights of disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and economics.
