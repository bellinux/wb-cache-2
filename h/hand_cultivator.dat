40|$|This {{station has}} experimented {{during the past}} season with several root crops, among which were the Long Red Mangel, Medium Red, Golden Tankard, Yellow Swedish Turnip, Rutabagas, and Carrots. These were planted on one acre of August plowed meadow sod ground, disced twice November 1 st in order to kill insects. In the spring it was plowed twelve inches deep and {{thoroughly}} pulverized by the disc and harrow. The seed was planted {{in the last days}} of May and first day of June, in small ridges, two feet apart, with a Planet Jr. seeder. Cultivation the first time was done with a <b>hand</b> <b>cultivator.</b> The few weeds in the rows were pulled by hand. After that, cultivation was done four times with a one horse Planet Jr. cultivator; at the last cultivation the earth was turned toward the rows. At this, time the ground between the rows was entirely shaded with the tops. The few remaining weeds, after the last cultivation, were removed with hand and hoe; comparatively little hand work was done. A good stand was obtained of all roots, except the carrots, which are most difficult to start, being slow of growth when young, and requiring more hand work than most roots...|$|E

40|$|In this study, field {{cultivator}} (FC), disk harrow (HD), combination of cultivator with spring teeth and rotary harrow (CS+RH) {{were used as}} secondary tillage equipment in spring. Physical properties of soil such as bulk density, porosity, mean weight diameter and aggregate stability were determined before and after tillage. Moreover, effect of different seedbed preparation techniques on yield of sunflower was also investigated. In {{the result of the}} study, differentiations among the secondary tillage equipment were observed due to bulk density and porosity. Small sized aggregates (1 - 5 mm) were highly in tillage with combination of cultivator with spring teeth and rotary harrow. While the mean weight diameter, which shows the durability of aggregates to water, was 2. 83 mm before tillage, it was 3. 96 mm in tillage with DH, 1. 80 mm in tillage with FC and 2. 50 mm in tillage with combination equipment. Although the mean weight diameter in tillage with DH increased, decreased in tillage with FC. The best aggregate stability obtained from seedbed preparation by disc harrow. On the other <b>hand</b> field <b>cultivator</b> is the most affective soil embossing tool while the cultivator with spring teeth rotary harrow combination is smashing. The yield values were found 2. 002 Mg ha- 1 with DH, 2. 106 Mg ha- 1 with FC, 2. 175 Mg ha- 1 with CS+RH...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{contributions}} made by Cretan Turks to the Turkish {{culture in}} general, {{the first to}} be mentioned should be their particular culinary traditions based on consumption at high-levels of olive oil and of a surprisingly wide array of herbs and other plant-based raw materials. While they have certainly not introduced olive oil and herbs to their compatriots, Cretan Turks have greatly extended the knowledge and paved the way for a more varied use of these products. Their predilection for herbs, some of which could be considered as unusual ones, has also been the source of some jokes. The Giritli chain of restaurants in İstanbul, Ankara and Bodrum, and Ayşe Ün's [...] "Girit Mutfağı" [...] (Cretan Cuisine) eateries in İzmir are indicative references in this regard. Occasional although intrinsically inadequate care has also been demonstrated by the authorities {{in the first years of}} the Turkish Republic for settling Cretan Turks in localities where vineyards left by the departed Greeks were found, since this capital was bound to be lost in the <b>hands</b> of <b>cultivators</b> with no prior knowledge of viniculture. In the field of , the pioneer of gulet boats construction that became a vast industry in Bodrum in our day, Ziya Güvendiren was a Cretan Turk, as are many of his former apprentices who themselves have become master shipbuilders and who are based in Bodrum or Güllük today.|$|R
40|$|Tillage {{practices}} affect {{physical properties}} of soil that are crucial for better crop production. The study {{was carried out}} to compare the efficiency of two different tillage implements and their effect on some soil physical properties. The tillage implements included cultivator and disc plow. The soil properties viz. soil moisture, bulk density and infiltration rate were determined {{before and after the}} tillage practices. However, the efficiency of tillage operation including operating speed, travel reduction and fuel consumption were taken during the tillage operation. The comparative analysis showed that the cultivator was better in reducing soil bulk density (12 - 18 %) along with increasing the infiltration rate up to 61. 5 % and conserving soil moisture up to 95 %. The disc plow, on the other hand, reduced the bulk density of soil more effectively with up to 21 % efficiency and enhancing soil porosity (23 %). However, disc plow was less efficient in increasing infiltration rate (38 %) and conserving soil moisture (87 - 90 %). Comparatively higher fuel consumption (23. 3 L hr- 1) was observed in operating disc plow with less operating speed (4. 1 km hr- 1) and higher travel reduction (27. 5 %). On the other <b>hand,</b> higher <b>cultivator</b> operating speed (4. 76 km hr- 1) was observed with less travel reduction (21. 8 %) and fuel consumption (14. 9 Lhr- 1). The cultivator, being more economical and having good effects on soil properties, was the best option for tillage operations in the clay soils of cotton-wheat rotation system under semi-arid climate of Tandojam, Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the spread}} of an {{extensive}} canal irrigation system in Purandhar taluka of Pune district, reocurring droughts highlight a contrasting social picture of poverty of rainfed agriculture on one had and small islands of perennial irrigation of sugarcane cultivation on the other. Control over water resources in this region, where farmers with access to water prefer to cultivate sugarcane, {{is the foundation of}} both political and economic power. Sugarcane is not simply a highly profitable crop, but it also concentrates political and economic power in the <b>hands</b> of its <b>cultivators.</b> The Pani Panchayat, was developed as a response to this, with the idea that in a drought-prone area no individual should be deprived from a rightful share of limited water resources. Control over water resources, {{in the case of the}} Pani Panchayat, pivots on communal power and equity. The Pani Panchayat method of allocating water on a per capita volumetric basis rather than on acreage has drastically reduced the amount of water received by larger farmers in the area. The prohibition of sugarcane cultivation by the Pani Panchaya...|$|R
