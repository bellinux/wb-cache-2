5|$|Attacks by the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} Army Group North west of Lake Peipus, {{resulting}} {{in a series of}} operations around Narva. In the south, Soviet forces had advanced towards the Baltic coast at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive (<b>June–August</b> 1944) against Army Group Centre. The Soviet Tallinn Offensive was designed {{as a part of the}} Baltic Offensive to eliminate the positions of Army Group North along the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|During <b>June–August</b> 1906, the {{government}} proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $300million (USD), {{claiming that he}} would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by {{the government}}, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.|$|E
5|$|Attacks of the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} the Army Group North {{to the west}} of Lake Peipus {{resulting}} in a series of operations around Narva. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, which eased the situation in Finland and kept the Soviet Baltic Fleet in its eastern bay. From a military economy viewpoint, the preservation of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was also important. In the south, Soviet forces advanced towards the Baltic seacoast {{at the end of their}} Operation Bagration of <b>June–August</b> 1944 against the German Army Group Centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Nemescu also started the {{production}} of California Dreamin. The filming {{took place in the}} <b>June–August</b> interval. By the end of August, the film was nearing its completion; on August 24, 2006, however, Nemescu and Andrei Toncu (sound engineer for the new project as well) died in a car accident in Bucharest. Following the accident, the Romanian public, as well as those from abroad, offered wider attention to the productions of the two cineasts, including Marilena from P7, their first notable success. One year after the accident, the event was commemorated in the country through various displays, public meetings and debates. On August 24, 2007, Marilena from P7 had its premiere at Stockholm during the second Romanian Film Days. Romanian people, from the diaspora, as well as Swedish spectators, were present.|$|E
5|$|She {{served in}} the Channel Fleet until 1868. After a refit and her first major re-armament, Achilles became the {{guardship}} at Portland until 1874 when she was again re-armed. Upon its completion in 1875, the ship became guardship at Liverpool until 1877 when Captain William Hewett, VC, assumed command. In 1878 {{she was one of}} the ships in the Particular Service Squadron which Admiral Geoffrey Hornby took through the Dardanelles at the time of the Russian war scare in <b>June–August</b> 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. Achilles accidentally collided with the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, , in October 1879, but was only lightly damaged by Alexandras propeller. The ship rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1880 and was paid off in 1885.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Argentina {{is a complex}} subject: the vast size {{of the country and}} {{considerable}} variation in altitude make {{for a wide range of}} climate types. Argentina has four seasons: winter (<b>June–August),</b> spring (September–November), summer (December–February) and autumn (March–May), all featuring different weather conditions. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, cool in the center and cold in the southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{began work}} on The Cantos in earnest after {{relocating}} to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to paradiso terrestre. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. The first three appear in Poetry in <b>June–August</b> 1917. The Malatesta Cantos appeared in The Criterion in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in The Transatlantic Review in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{landings}} {{took place}} beginning 6 June 1944. 21st Panzer Division under Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger, positioned south of Caen, {{was the only}} panzer division close to the beaches. The division included 146 tanks and 50 assault guns, plus supporting infantry and artillery. At 02:00, Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, commander of the 716th Static Infantry Division, ordered 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division {{was part of the}} armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne. SS-Hitlerjugend began to deploy in the afternoon of 6 June, with its units undertaking defensive actions the following day. They also took part in the Battle for Caen (<b>June–August</b> 1944). On 7–8 and 17 June, members of the SS-Hitlerjugend shot and killed twenty Canadian prisoners of war in the Ardenne Abbey massacre.|$|E
5|$|The use of Malmö Stadion for concerts has {{increased}} since {{the construction of}} Swedbank Stadion and Malmö FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Dolly Parton, The Eagles, Kiss, and Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden {{and the lack of}} a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between <b>June–August.</b> The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern Stand, or along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden floorboards during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and Dolly Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable for this kind of concert.|$|E
5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of £196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part of the Particular Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of <b>June–August</b> 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her shallow draught caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five years service at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South Africa, as a receiving ship the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 for the price of £1,650. The ship was broken up at Genoa, Italy, in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Saborsko Independent Company, {{consisting}} of approximately 30 personnel, {{was stationed in}} the village by the Croatian police {{the day after the}} Plitvice Lakes incident on 1 April 1991. The tensions worsened in July. That month the JNA distributed 1,000 small arms to ethnic Serbs living in Gorski kotar region, including Plaški. Skirmishes took place near Josipdol and Plaški. In <b>June–August,</b> Saborsko was targeted by artillery and mortars positioned at JNA barracks in Lička Jasenica, and the bulk of its civilian population fled by early August. However, approximately 400 returned to their homes the same month after 20–30 special police troops were deployed from Duga Resa to Saborsko along with 15–20 regular police drawn from Slunj as reinforcements. On 25 September, 100–200 police reservists arrived to Saborsko from Zagreb. The final Croatian reinforcements arrived in October, {{consisting of}} 20–50 police. By October, a pocket of Croatian-controlled territory formed around the town of Slunj south of Karlovac, on the boundary of the regions of Kordun and Lika, hampering direct communications between SAO Krajina-held areas in the two regions. The pocket was separated from the bulk of the Croatian Government-controlled territory by the SAO Krajina-controlled town of Plaški to the west. In turn, Plaški was inaccessible to the central SAO Krajina authorities as the road to Plaški ran through the village of Saborsko, situated within the Slunj pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of Kronan was {{estimated}} at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary currency, and {{about half of the}} cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore {{in the interest of the}} Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons as possible. In the early 1660s almost all the guns from Vasa had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were put in charge of the salvage of Kronan's cannons. With the help of diving bells, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. <b>June–August)</b> of 1679–86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to Vasa with a diving bell made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on Kronan. The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Öland were often difficult, with cold water and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian Björn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of Kronan's 36-pounder guns.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{invasion of}} Gibraltar {{was by the}} Moors, Muslim Arabs and Berbers who arrived from North Africa {{at the beginning of}} the eighth century. They used the area as a base from which to launch an invasion of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula which resulted in most of Iberia coming under Moorish rule. The Spanish Reconquista began later in the eighth century. The campaign eventually took 800 years to force the Moors back across the Strait, and did not reach the Bay of Gibraltar until the fourteenth century. It was not until 1309, nearly 600 years after Gibraltar was first settled, that the first siege of Gibraltar was recorded. King Ferdinand I of Castile began a siege of Algeciras on the other side of the bay in July, but his naval blockade was unable to stop supplies being smuggled in small boats from Gibraltar to the besieged city. He sent an army under Alonso Pérez de Guzmán to take Gibraltar. De Guzmán succeeded after a month-long siege, and Gibraltar was settled by the Castilians for the first time. Six years later, the Moors attempted to retake the peninsula in the brief second siege which was abandoned at the sight of a Castilian relief force. Another Moorish attempt eventually succeeded in the third siege of February–June 1333. A Castilian attempt to retake it in the fourth siege of <b>June–August</b> 1333 failed, as did the fifth siege of 1349–50, in which King Alfonso XI of Castile lost his life in an outbreak of bubonic plague among the besiegers. The Moors of Granada and Fez fell out with each other over Gibraltar in 1411, leading to the Granadans besieging the fortified town in the sixth siege and seizing it from the Marinids of Fez. Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla made a failed attempt to capture Gibraltar in the seventh siege of 1436, during which he perished.|$|E

25|$|JUSE {{members had}} studied Shewhart's techniques, {{and as part}} of Japan's {{reconstruction}} efforts, they sought an expert to teach statistical control. From <b>June–August</b> 1950, Deming trained hundreds of engineers, managers, and scholars in statistical process control (SPC) and concepts of quality. He also conducted at least one session for top management (including top Japanese industrialists of the likes of Akio Morita, the cofounder of Sony Corp.) Deming's message to Japan's chief executives was that improving quality would reduce expenses while increasing productivity and market share. Perhaps the best known of these management lectures was delivered at the Mt. Hakone Conference Center in August 1950.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, several {{attempts}} at peace negotiations {{had been made}} by various factions, but to no avail. First attempt at Polish-Soviet negotiations took place in Białowieża from <b>June–August</b> 1919. None of them were successful, and the war raged on. With White Russian general Denikin unwilling to guarantee Polish independence, Polish negotiators initiated another round of negotiations with the Bolsheviks, from October until December 1919 in Moscow and Mikaszewicze (on Polesie). While the negotiations slightly slowed down the pace of conflict between Poles and Bolsheviks, this mostly allowed Bolshevicks to concentrate bulk of their forces on destroying the Denikin's army advancing towards Moscow. The negotiations in early 1920 would be considered a token effort by both sides, which were preparing for a major offensive.|$|E
