2500|$|In 2000, the Golden Stags and the Heavy Bombers {{met in the}} Final Four. JRC {{clinched}} the 1 seed while SSC-R got the 4th seed. The Stags defeated the Bombers twice {{to advance to the}} Finals against CSB. Thus, the Stags became the second (Letran <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> in 1999 also against the Stags) 4th seed to upset the 1st seed in the Final Four. SSC-R and JRU also met in the 2001 Finals. JRU was bannered by Ariel Capus, [...] season MVP Ernani Epondulan, Rodel Milla, Joel Finuliar and razzle dazzle pointguard Erwin Estebal while San Sebastian was led by Mark Macapagal, Christian Coronel and Jam Alfad. JRU lost in the series, which included a 33-point blowout loss in the deciding Game 3. Coronel was named as the 2001 NCAA Finals MVP.|$|E
2500|$|When But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes was {{published}} in 1927, Emerson proposed another European vacation and went ahead of Loos to visit medical specialists. A seriously ill but still devoted Loos followed him, always being left one hotel behind. When Loos came down with a sinus attack in Vienna, she and the ear, nose and throat specialist who was treating her {{came up with a}} method of [...] "fixing" [...] Emerson's hypochondria. The doctor arranged a bit of sham surgery for him and presented him with the [...] "polyps" [...] that had been supposedly removed from his vocal cords. This placebo treatment <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> and when they returned a cured Emerson took great pleasure in showing off his little sloshy trophy. Not wanting to undo all her efforts, Loos retired to a life of leisure.|$|E
2500|$|The public {{information}} campaign over the preceding two years helped, as <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> {{of getting a}} rough conversion of new pence into old shillings and pence by simply doubling {{the number of new}} pence and placing a solidus, or slash, between the digits: 17p multiplied by 2=34, – approximately equal to 3/4 ("three and four", or three shillings and four pence), with a similar process for the reverse conversion. The willingness of a young population to embrace the change also helped. In general, elderly people had more difficulty adapting and the phrase [...] "How much is that in old money?" [...] or even [...] "How much is that in real money?" [...] became associated with those who struggled with the change. (This phrase is now often used to ask for conversion between metric and imperial weights and measures.) ...|$|E

2500|$|White, however {{was not at}} {{the studio}} for the final {{recording}} on 26 November and was only hired for the 11 September session. As recorded on 26 November, Lennon's harmonica playing features prominently and, similar to other early Beatles' compositions such as [...] "Love Me Do" [...] and [...] "From Me to You", opens the song. McCartney and Lennon initially share the vocals with McCartney holding a high note while Lennon drops down through the scale, a ploy they learned from the Everly Brothers UK hit song [...] "Cathy's Clown" [...] (April 1960). McCartney said: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> of remaining on the high note while the melody cascaded down from it". Ringo Starr asserts himself, exorcising any lingering doubts from the [...] "Love Me Do" [...] sessions regarding his ability. Where [...] "Love Me Do" [...] had been arguably parochial, relying to a large extent on their existing home fans for support [...] "Please Please Me" [...] would be groundbreaking, especially as The Beatles were now back in the UK and able to appear on influential national television shows such as Thank Your Lucky Stars.|$|E
2500|$|Shibe scion Jack briefly {{tried his}} hand as a boxing {{promoter}} in the early 1910s, shortly after his father built Shibe Park, and {{although he did not}} pursue the career, he did make the acquaintance of other promoters in the Philadelphia boxing world, including Bob Gunnis and Herman [...] "Muggsy" [...] Taylor. Gunnis and Taylor became among the first promoters to book a bout into a major league baseball stadium when they brought Johnny Dundee vs. George Chaney to Shibe Park in July 1917, and although the fight itself was unremarkable, the concept propelled Gunnis and Taylor to the forefront of their trade. Over the next forty years, perhaps a hundred boxing cards took place at Shibe, some of them big-time pairings and even championship bouts. Benny Leonard retained his championship against challenger Johnny Kilbane in 1917, and 1928's Benny Bass vs. Harry Blitman was said by sportswriters to be the best featherweight bout in the city's history. In the 1950s, Gil Turner, Ike Williams, Charley Fusari and many other top fighters fought important bouts at Shibe Park. At first, groundskeepers set the ring up over the pitcher's mound, but soon this changed to the area over home plate with the baseball backstops dismantled; spectators sat in the main grandstand for the fight. Even before the installation of the light towers in 1939, staging night boxing was easy because of the vastly smaller area that needed to be lit –portable searchlights <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|E

60|$|Though Umquenawis be {{lord of the}} wilderness, {{there are}} two things, and two things only, which he {{sometimes}} fears: the smell of man, and the spiteful crack of a rifle. For Milord the Moose has been hunted and has learned fear, which formerly he was stranger to. But when you go deep into the wilderness, where no hunter has ever gone, and where the bang of a rifle following the roar of a birch-bark trumpet has never broken the twilight stillness, there you may find him still, as he was before fear came; there he will come smashing down the mountain side at your call, and never circle to wind an enemy; and there, when the mood is on him, he will send you scrambling up the nearest tree for your life, as a squirrel goes when the fox is after him. Once, in such a mood, I saw him charge a little wiry guide, who went up a spruce tree with his snowshoes on; and never a bear <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> quicker, spite of the four-foot webs in which his feet were tangled.|$|E
60|$|Barely was {{the first}} minute of play past when I <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> I feigned a slight slip of the foot, and, in the recovery, feigned loss of touch with Pasquini's blade. He thrust tentatively, and again I feigned, this time making a needlessly wide parry. The {{consequent}} exposure of myself was the bait I had purposely dangled to draw him on. And draw him on I did. Like a flash he took advantage of what he deemed an involuntary exposure. Straight and true was his thrust, and all his will and body were heartily in {{the weight of the}} lunge he made. And all had been feigned on my part and I was ready for him. Just lightly did my steel meet his as our blades slithered. And just firmly enough and no more did my wrist twist and deflect his blade on my basket hilt. Oh, such a slight deflection, a matter of inches, just barely sufficient to send his point past me so that it pierced a fold of my satin doublet in passing. Of course, his body followed his rapier in the lunge, while, heart-high, right side, my rapier point met his body. And my outstretched arm was stiff and straight as the steel into which it elongated, and behind the arm and the steel my body was braced and solid.|$|E
60|$|John Mackenzie, Glenure's servant, now rode onwards {{at a great}} gallop to find Campbell of Ballieveolan, and on his way came to Acharn and met James Stewart, {{with the}} two {{ancestors}} of my friend, as already described. He gave the news to James, who 'wrung his hands and expressed great concern at what had happened, as what might bring innocent people to trouble.' In fact, he had once, or oftener, when drinking, {{expressed a desire to}} have a shot at Glenure, and so had Allan. But James was a worthy, sensible man when sober, and must have known that, while he could not frighten the commissioners of forfeited estates by shooting their agent, he was certain to be suspected if their agent was shot. As a matter of fact, as we shall see, he had taken active steps to secure the presence of a Fort William solicitor at the evictions on Friday, May 15, to put in a legal protest. But he thought it unadvisable to walk three or four miles and look after Glenure's corpse; the Highlanders, to this day, have a strong dread or dislike of corpses. That night James bade his people hide his arms, four swords, a long Spanish gun, and a shorter gun, neither of which weapons, in fact, <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> nor could be depended on not to miss fire.|$|E
