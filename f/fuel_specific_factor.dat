40|$|Abstract: The {{projections}} of energy related carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions in the}} Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) serve as {{point of departure for}} an assessment of plausible ranges of CO 2 emissions that could be avoided through CO 2 capture and storage measures. Scenario and time dependent, sector and <b>fuel</b> <b>specific</b> capture <b>factors</b> are developed for eleven world regions to estimate the proportion of CO 2 resulting from fossil fuel and biomass combustion/ conversion that might be practical to capture and store. The capture factors are applied to the original CO 2 emissions scenarios at a highly disaggregated level. The results are summed up and presented. The results indicate that {{it might be possible to}} capture and store a significant quantity of energy related CO 2, especially in the second quarter of this century. Yet the amounts of CO 2 still being emitted remain considerable, suggesting that other technologies will also be needed if the threat of climate change requires large reductions of CO 2 emissions over the next few decades...|$|R

The paper summarizes four fuel innovation product investigations commissioned to and carried out by Department of Automotive Engineering of Riga Technical University in a year scope. The innovative solutions offered by entrepreneurs contained a fossil diesel <b>fuel</b> treated by <b>specific</b> technology and three diesel fuel additives. The promoters of the products referred to pre-existing measurements showing 10 to 30 percent reduction of fuel consumption. Comparative experimental measurements using diesel fuel available in retail with and without usage of the proposed products have been done in laboratory conditions. The tests were performed on stationary diesel generator RD 2. 0. Solid, repetitive results have been gained.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} psychosocial factors related to the onset of bipolar I disorder (BD). To do so, the Bipolar Disorder Etiology Scale (BDES), based on psychological behaviorism, was developed and validated. Using the BDES, common factors related to both major depressive disorder (MDD) and BD and <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> related only to BD were investigated. METHOD: The BDES, which measures 17 factors based on psychological behaviorism hypotheses, was developed and validated. This scale was administered to 113 non-clinical control subjects, 30 subjects with MDD, and 32 people with BD. ANOVA and post hoc analyses were conducted. Subscales on which MDD and BD groups scored higher than controls were classified as common factors, while those on which the BD group scored higher than MDD and control groups were classified as <b>specific</b> <b>factors.</b> RESULTS: The BDES has acceptable reliability and validity. Twelve common factors influence both MDD and BD and one <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> influences only BD. Common factors include the following: learning grandiose self-labeling, learning dangerous behavior, reinforcing impulsive behavior, exposure to irritability, punishment of negative emotional expression, lack of support, sleep problems, antidepressant problems, positive arousal to threat, lack of social skills, and pursuit of short-term pleasure. The <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> is manic emotional response.

40|$|Background: Recent {{investigations}} {{of the structure of}} psychiatric symptoms and disorders provide empirical support for a trans-diagnostic distress component to mental illness in addition to <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> potentially differentiating individual diagnoses. The well documented developmental trends of psychopathology symptoms across adolescence may need re-evaluation within the context of general distress and disorder specific components. Methods: Within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network, large scale factor analysis was implemented across 116 items measuring mental well-being and specific domains of psychopathology (depression, anxiety, antisocial behaviour, OCD, and psychotic symptoms). The sample was 2228 individuals between the ages of 14 and 24. Developmental age trends of a general distress <b>factor</b> and five <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> (measuring confidence, antisocial behaviour, worry, OCD/Psychotic symptom, and mood) were evaluated for boys and girls. Findings: The confidence and OCD/Psychotic <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> did not show gender differences and declined across the age range. The antisocial <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> also showed decline across the age range with higher levels for boys, while the worry <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> showed increasing levels with higher levels for girls. Girls showed increasing followed by decreasing levels in the general distress and mood factors. Boys showed an increase then a levelling off in general distress and a developmental increase in mood throughout the age range. Discussion: While the general distress factor replicates established developmental trends, the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> show unexpected developmental trends indicating potential differences in developmental trends dependent on how we conceptualise mental well and ill health...|$|R

40|$|When a self-report {{instrument}} {{includes a}} balanced number of positively and negatively worded items, factor analysts often use method factors to aid model fitting. The {{nature of these}} factors, {{often referred to as}} acquiescence, is still debated. Relying upon previous results (Alessandri et al., 2010; DiStefano & Motl, 2006, 2008; Rauch, Schweizer, & Moosbrugger, 2007), we submit that the so-called method factors, instead, represent substantive <b>specific</b> <b>factors.</b> This study investigates the convergence of method effects across different observers.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} trade on wages {{in the context of}} the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> model by focusing on the link between trade and the average real wage. A recent paper by Jones & Ruffin (2008) shows how one can use the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> model to predict how labor should fare from an improvement in the terms of trade, an increase in the price of exportables relative to importables. For this purpose, I use annual firm-level data on the manufacturing sector in Tanzania during the period 1992 to 1998. I find that a ceteris paribus increase in the price of exportables may benefit labor in the food-beverage industry but hurt labor in the textile-garment, wood-furniture and metal-machinery industries. There are industries where the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> model predicts that exporting would help workers, but where the Stolper-Samuelson theorem of the Hecksher-Ohlin model predicts the reverse. <b>Specific</b> <b>factor</b> model, wages, terms of trade, elasticity of substitution,...|$|R
40|$|A new {{presentation}} of the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> model shows how labor fares under international trade by considering how the price elasticity of the nominal wage rate responds {{to the terms of}} trade as well as factor endowments. The key empirical implication is that under a standard assumption about tastes it is straightforward to decompose the gains to labor into measurable terms of trade effects and production bias effects. This provides the basis for suggested time series studies contrasting the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> model with the Heckscher-Ohlin model. We then perform a new theoretical analysis of the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> model to compare how labor fares under autarky and free trade. Copyright � 2007 The Authors. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to examine the Double Dividend (DD) hypothesis. Using the general {{equilibrium}} GTAP model data for Australia and the UK, we incorporate endogenous production taxes to achieve targeted abatement policies {{in the production of}} energy goods (coal, oil, gas, petroleum, electricity). Following Bento and Jacobsen (2007), we examine the role played <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> in the production of energy goods. In particular, we employ a novel approach to model the impact of <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> on the existence and magnitude of the DD. We also incorporate endogenous labour supply, which allows us to illustrate the size of the labour market effect of targeted abatement policies. Our results indicate that with abatement tax revenue offset by reductions in other government distortions, we can identify which specific forms of revenue recycling yield a DD. For Australia we find that the magnitude of the DD is significantly larger when we employ the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> characterisation of an economy and we recycle the revenue through reductions in consumption taxes. However, we find no evidence of a DD for Australia when we employ income tax as the recycling instrument.
