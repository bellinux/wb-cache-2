25|$|Most serious of the elm pests is the {{elm leaf beetle}} Xanthogaleruca luteola, {{which can}} decimate foliage, {{although}} rarely with fatal results. The beetle was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe. Another unwelcome immigrant to North America is the <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetle</b> Popillia japonica. In both instances the beetles cause far more damage in North America owing {{to the absence of}} the predators present in their native lands. In Australia, introduced elm trees are sometimes used as foodplants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down.|$|E
25|$|The University of Illinois {{conducted}} {{studies to}} measure the effect of warmer temperatures on soybean plant growth and <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetle</b> populations. Warmer temperatures and elevated CO2 levels were simulated for one field of soybeans, while the other was left as a control. These studies found that the soybeans with elevated CO2 levels grew much faster and had higher yields, but attracted Japanese beetles at a significantly higher rate than the control field. The beetles in the field with increased CO2 also laid more eggs on the soybean plants and had longer lifespans, indicating {{the possibility of a}} rapidly expanding population. DeLucia projected that if the project were to continue, the field with elevated CO2 levels would eventually show lower yields than that of the control field.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetle,</b> an {{important}} agricultural insect pest, becomes rapidly paralyzed after consuming flower petals {{of the garden}} hybrids known as [...] "zonal geraniums" [...] (P.×hortorum). The phenomenon was first described in 1920, and subsequently confirmed. Research conducted by Dr. Christopher Ranger with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and other collaborating scientists have demonstrated the excitatory amino acid called quisqualic acid present within the flower petals is responsible for causing paralysis of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetle.</b> Quisqualic acid is thought to mimic L-glutamic acid, which is a neurotransmitter in the insect neuromuscular junction and mammalian central nervous system.|$|E

30|$|We have {{presented}} {{the hypothesis that}} male <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetles</b> use body size as a cue for sexual discrimination. An alternative possibility is that males use cuticular hydrocarbons present on females for sexual discrimination (e.g., Simmons and Alcock [2003]). Although no evidence exists for <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetles</b> using cuticular hydrocarbons in this fashion, if females had such compounds, {{it is at least}} possible that males might acquire female hydrocarbons on their bodies after contact with females (either while mating in the field or during collecting). Future studies that test for the existence of cuticular hydrocarbons and assess their potential roles in sexual discrimination and male-male pairing behavior would be useful to address this possibility. However, even if present and used for sexual discrimination, cuticular hydrocarbons would not reduce the behavior we observed to being a laboratory artifact; male-male pairing (with similar size patterns) occurs consistently under natural conditions in the field in <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetles</b> (Switzer et al. [2004]).|$|R
30|$|Answering {{the second}} question, why males remain mounted on another male, is more problematic. In many species, {{same-sex}} mounts are very brief (e.g., Aiken [1981]). In <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetles,</b> however, {{we found that}} although mounts were usually brief, occasionally mounts lasted over 2  h. Based {{on the results of}} this study, our hypothesis is that male <b>Japanese</b> <b>beetles</b> have two main ‘cues’ available to them to distinguish non-virgin females from males: body size and copulation. These two cues, in combination with the fact that females may not immediately copulate with a male upon being mounted, may lead to extended mounts. We elaborate on this hypothesis below.|$|R
