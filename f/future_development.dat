5|$|In April 1934, {{following}} the moving of the Richard Johnson, Clapham and Morris Ltd firm to Trafford Park, the playing grounds were {{offered to the}} Parks Committee of the Manchester Corporation for £2,400. At the time, the ground was described as being fenced all round with iron railings, containing bowling greens, a number of tennis courts and a cricket pitch, together with two well-built pavilions. For many years the land was used for community events including football and funfairs. A cycle speedway track was built during the 1980s. In 2005, a 2.4 m green powder coated weld mesh fence with gates was erected at {{the perimeter of the}} fields.

Later that year, the county proposed an extension of the freeway east to US80 and Third Street in El Cajon. In 1966, the U.S. Army's Board of Engineers supported the construction of the flood channel, to protect <b>future</b> <b>development</b> in the surrounding region from flooding; the integration of SR54 was included in the proposal.|$|E

5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and <b>future</b> <b>development</b> in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of.

5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was. Activision later opted to put <b>future</b> <b>development</b> of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the <b>future</b> <b>development</b> and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E
5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown argued about what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's <b>future</b> <b>development,</b> which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so much faith in Clyde's ability that he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. When the season ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran Willie Horton to the Cleveland Indians for Tom Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E
