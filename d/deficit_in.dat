5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by <b>deficit</b> <b>in</b> attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known <b>deficit</b> <b>in</b> long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of <b>deficit</b> <b>in</b> cognitive abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

40|$|<b>Deficits</b> <b>in</b> {{emotional}} clarity, or difficulties identifying which emotions one feels, {{are increasingly}} associated with multiple forms of psychopathology. We addressed two fundamental, unresolved issues regarding the transdiagnostic {{nature of this}} dysfunction. First, we examined the relationship of <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> emotional clarity to seven symptom types, accounting for possible confounding effects of overlapping symptoms. We found that <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> emotional clarity were associated with symptoms of depression, social anxiety, borderline personality, binge eating, and alcohol use, but not anxious arousal or restrictive eating. Second, we tested whether <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> emotional clarity would relate to psychopathology by way of impaired emotion regulation. Notably, the relationship between <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> emotional clarity and each symptom type was mediated by a distinct, disorderspecific pattern of emotion regulation deficits. Findings suggest that <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> emotional clarity can be conceptualized as a transdiagnostic process with diverging mechanisms involving emotion regulation difficulties that vary from disorder to disorder. We discuss these findings within a contextual approach to delineating transdiagnostic processes...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on learning and memory in 14 -year-old adolescents. The Children’s Memory Scale {{was used to assess}} learning and memory function in the verbal/auditory and visual/spatial domains. In addition, both short- and long-term memory function were assessed. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project, a longitudinal study including 580 children and their mothers. Women were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and with their children from birth to 16 years of age. At age 14, memory function was evaluated using the Children’s Memory Scale, an assessment tool that measures learning and immediate and delayed memory function in the verbal and visual-spatial domains. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure during the first trimester predicted <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory, specifically in the verbal domain. <b>Deficits</b> <b>in</b> performance were specific to learning and memory of word-pairs. <b>In</b> addition, <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> memory were mediated by learning performance. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure lead to <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> encoding processes as indicated by <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> verbal learning. Initial <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> acquisition were responsible for <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> immediate and delayed recall of verbal information in children who were exposed to alcohol during pregnancy but did not have fetal alcohol syndrome.

40|$|Abstract Background Depressive {{symptoms}} in children {{are associated with}} social skills deficits and problems with peers. We propose a model which suggests different mechanisms {{for the impact of}} <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> self-oriented social skills (assertiveness and social participation) and other-oriented social skills (pro-social, cooperative and non-aggressive behaviors) on children's depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> self-oriented social skills have a direct impact on children's depressive symptoms because these children have non-rewarding interactions with peers, whereas the impact of <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> other-oriented social skills on depressive symptoms is mediated through negative reactions from peers such as peer victimization. Method 378 kindergarten children (163 girls) participated at two assessments (Age at T 1 : M = 5. 8, T 2 : M = 7. 4). Teachers completed questionnaires on children's social skills at T 1. Teacher reports on peer victimization and depressive symptoms were assessed at both assessment points. Results Our study partially confirmed the suggested conceptual model. <b>Deficits</b> <b>in</b> self-oriented social skills significantly predicted depressive symptoms, whereas <b>deficits</b> <b>in</b> other-oriented social skills were more strongly associated with peer victimization. Longitudinal associations between other-oriented social skills and depressive symptoms were mediated through peer victimization.
