5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E
5|$|Michigan won {{the coin}} toss and elected to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second half, and Alabama opened {{play with a}} three-and-out. Michigan was then held to only one first down before they punted on their first possession. On the drive that ensued, Alabama's mix of play-action passes and rushes ended with a two-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Michael Williams from AJ McCarron for a 7–0 lead. After the Crimson Tide defense again forced a Wolverine punt, on Alabama's next drive, McCarron connected with DeAndrew White for a 51-yard touchdown reception and a 14–0 lead. Michigan stalled on their next drive after Denard Robinson threw an interception to Dee Milliner who returned it to Michigan's 17-yard line. On third down, Eddie Lacy rushed nine yards {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown and a 21–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{was willing}} to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company on the design (Ellsworth withdrew his threat not to allow his {{painting}} {{to be used by}} the end of August), but the Company's Finance Committee was unable to reach a decision on what design to use. Warner returned to work on the badges to be worn by the fair's directors at the dedication ceremony in October—the fair itself would not open to the public until May 1893. These badges included a round disk with a portrait of Columbus in high relief based on the Lotto portrait, and when one was displayed it was immediately spoken of as a possible basis for the half dollar. The Company also considered a design with three ships, and another with a single ship and a depiction of the Western Hemisphere, both provided by the Mint. Contemporary accounts also mention a reverse design considered by the Company which depicted a building at the Exposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{silky shark}} {{is one of}} the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|E
25|$|Richard Kendall of the Los Angeles firm Shearman & Sterling {{argued the}} case for Citibank. He was joined by Irving Gornstein {{on behalf of the}} {{government}} as amicus curiae. Both argued for the Court to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Comptroller's statutory interpretation.|$|E

When Huston entered the military, Welles {{was given the}} chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio in any creative dispute.|$|E
25|$|Federalist No. 70’s {{arguments}} for an energetic, unitary executive are often {{cited in the}} context of national security. After 9/11, executive power and secrecy took on a more central role in the pursuit of national security. In this regard, members of the post 9/11 United States Department of Justice have argued that foreign policy is most effectively conducted with a single hand, meaning that Congress should <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> president’s authority.|$|E

40|$|Three- and 4 -year-old {{children}} {{were asked to}} judge which {{of a set of}} 3 lines was the longest, both independently and {{in the face of an}} inaccurate consensus among adult informants. Children were invariably accurate when making independent judgments but sometimes <b>deferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inaccurate consensus. Nevertheless, the deference displayed by both age groups proved to be circumscribed. When asked to solve a practical problem—selecting <b>the</b> longest strip <b>to</b> build an adequate bridge—both groups relied on their own perceptual judgment, regardless of whether they had <b>deferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inaccurate consensus. Confirming earlier meta-analytic findings with adults, the rate of deference was greater among Asian American children as compared with Caucasian American children...|$|R
25|$|Smiley v. Citibank, (517 U.S. 735), is a 1996 U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} upholding {{a regulation}} of the Comptroller of Currency which included credit card late fees and other penalties within the definition of interest and thus prevented individual states from limiting them when charged by nationally-chartered banks. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a unanimous court that the regulation was reasonable enough under the Court's own Chevron standard for the justices to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Comptroller.|$|E
25|$|While {{preparations}} for new elections were underway, however, the First Balkan War erupted early in October 1912, catching Ahmed Muhtar Pasha's administration off-guard.

25|$|In the 1951 case, the Indian Claims Commission {{acknowledged}} {{there might}} have been discrimination by the tribe against certain mixed-blood descendants such as Barada; however, the court dismissed the case {{on the grounds that the}} Indian Claims Commission did not have jurisdiction over a group claim of individual members; rather, its responsibilities were to adjudicate claims of tribes against the government.

In his autobiography The Dukula the lama repeatedly remarks how he had to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Desi, or had to do as he said, and even as an adult he rarely got his way if he disagreed with Sonam Rapten's wishes.|$|E
25|$|Meade was {{hampered}} {{during the}} retreat and pursuit {{not only by}} his alleged timidity and his willingness to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cautious judgment of his subordinate commanders, but because his army was exhausted. The advance to Gettysburg was swift and tiring, followed by the largest battle of the war. The pursuit of Lee was physically demanding, through inclement weather and over difficult roads much longer than his opponent's. Enlistments expired, causing depletion of his ranks, as did the New York Draft Riots, which occupied thousands of men that could have reinforced the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
25|$|Season four's main mystery {{revolves}} around Juliet Sharp (Katie Cassidy), a secretive girl with an agenda against Serena involving her past. The {{second half of}} the season builds on the complications of Serena's new found relationship with her former teacher Colin, Chuck trying to regain control of Bass Industries from Russell Thorpe (Michael Boatman), and Dan and Blair's growing friendship. The season also focuses on Lily's past betrayals coming back to haunt her; Chuck and Blair's tumultuous relationship after their break up; Dan and Vanessa's deteriorating friendship; and the arrival of Serena's cousin Charlie Rhodes (Kaylee <b>Defer)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Upper East Side. By the end of the season, Blair has ignored Chuck, Dan has told Vanessa they are no longer friends, and Serena is on that single grind.|$|E

25|$|When he was {{appointed}}, {{all other}} justices {{had been appointed}} by Democrats, Franklin D. Roosevelt or Truman, and all were committed New Deal liberals. But they disagreed about {{the role that the}} courts should play in achieving liberal goals. The Court was split between two warring factions. Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson led one faction, which insisted upon judicial self-restraint and insisted courts should <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction; they agreed the court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy, but felt the judicial agenda had been transformed from questions of property rights to those of individual liberties, and in this area, courts should play a more activist role. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the activists, although {{he did not have a}} solid majority until after Frankfurter's retirement in 1962.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the coin}} toss, Virginia Tech elected to <b>defer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second half. Michigan elected to receive, which ensured that Virginia Tech would start {{the second half}} on offense. Justin Myer kicked off for the Hokies and Michael Cox {{returned}} the kick to Michigan's 34-yard line. Michigan began the game missing starting C David Molk, who suffered a foot injury during the pre-game warmup. Michigan went three and out on its first drive that featured two fumbled snaps by Denard Robinson, Michigan was forced to punt. Tech received the ball at its own 37-yard line. Logan Thomas completed his first pass to Danny Coale and then completed another pass, this time to Jarret Boykins for 14 yards and a first down. Following a David Wilson run for loss of four yards, Thomas completed an 18-yard pass to D.J. Coles. Wilson then had two consecutive carries for eight yards and one-yard respectively. Following a Thomas three-yard run, Wilson ran for 11 yards to the Michigan four-yard line. On the next play Wilson rushed for a loss of 22 yards. Tech was forced {{to settle for a}} 37-yard field goal after it committed a delay of game penalty on second down, and after attempts on second and third down did not succeed.|$|E
