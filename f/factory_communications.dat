5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} a number of militia infantry battalions were called out to carry out guard duties upon infrastructure that was considered important to the war effort, such as munitions <b>factories,</b> <b>communications</b> facilities, ammunition dumps and transportation centres. 500 men from the Kennedy Regiment were sent to Thursday Island from Townsville to garrison the island in response to a possible threat from German forces in the Pacific. Additionally, militia troops were used to establish and guard internment camps and garrison artillery and engineer units from the militia were also mobilised to assist the regular units that were manning coastal defences.|$|R

A performance analysis of a potential ATM system on fieldbus level is presented by providing simulation results. The simulations study the influence of different network topologies, ATM cell scheduling strategies and the presence of video streams on the transmission of real-time control data...|$|E

This last property allows priority inheritance of real-time threads across a factory network. As a conclusion, switches could be used for devices connection, whilst routers could be dedicated to real-time priorities management. We describes in this paper our experiments on the use of iproute 2 and tc in Linux to improve our knowledge of QoS management in routers. 1...|$|E

5000|$|Group pilots flew Spitfires from Gibraltar to Algeria during Operation Torch, the {{invasion}} of North Africa on 8 November 1942. The remainder of the group arrived by ship after the campaign in Algeria and Morocco had ended. The group then operated as part of Twelfth Air Force through April 1944, thereafter becoming a part of Fifteenth Air Force, serving in combat in the Mediterranean {{until the end of}} World War II. It flew escort, patrol, strafing, and reconnaissance missions to help defeat Axis forces in Tunisia. In Sicily, it attacked railroads, highways, bridges, coastal shipping and other targets to support the Allied operations. Having converted to North American P-51 Mustangs in April and May 1944, the group escorted bombers that attacked objectives in Italy, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia. It received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for a mission on 9 June 1944 when the group protected bombers that struck aircraft <b>factories,</b> <b>communications</b> centers, and supply lines in Germany. The 52d flew one of the first shuttle missions to Russia from 4-6 August 1944, and received a second DUC for strafing attacks on a landing field in Romania on 31 August 1944, destroying a large number of enemy fighter and transport planes. On 24 March 1945, the group's aircraft flew the longest escort mission ever flown in Europe—1600 miles round-trip to Berlin. By the end of the war, the group's Mustangs had adopted yellow markings that covered the entire tail of the aircraft, earning them the nickname of [...] "Yellow Tails. [...] The 52d returned to the US in August 1945 and was inactivated on 7 November 1945.|$|R

The food crisis increased to include over 20 million people (80% of the population) going hungry. Airstrikes destroyed a mine <b>factory</b> and a <b>communications</b> center. Local sources reported that 13 villagers were killed due to shelling near the border.|$|R
25|$|Ethical vegetarianism {{has become}} popular in {{developed}} countries particularly because of the spread of <b>factory</b> farming, faster <b>communications,</b> and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} year of the {{resistance}} the BCP used mainly its combat groups. They carried out a number of actions, including arson and demolition of arms, clothes and fuel warehouses, <b>communications,</b> <b>factories</b> and transport lines. The combat groups assassinated prominent Bulgarian politicians, army and police leaders, and Wehrmacht officers. The combat groups' activities impaired the image of Hitler's supporters in Bulgaria but a great number of their members were captured or killed.|$|R
25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{air power}} theorists like Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating {{the need for}} land and sea fighting. It was thought that bombers would always get through {{and could not be}} resisted, {{particularly}} at night. Industry, seats of government, <b>factories</b> and <b>communications</b> could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the means to make war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale and a loss of production in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The RAF and the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of RAF Bomber Command became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.|$|R
50|$|The basic plan is {{to provide}} a {{structure}} that is very strong in compression. The actual strength specification must be done individually, based on the nature and probability of the threat. A typical specification for heavy civil defence shelter in Europe during the Cold war was an overhead explosion of a 500 kiloton weapon at the height of 500 meters. Such a weapon would be used to attack soft targets (<b>factories,</b> administrative centres, <b>communications)</b> in the area.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{air power}} theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused {{the idea that}} air forces could win wars, without a need for land and sea fighting. It was thought there was no defence against air attack, {{particularly}} at night. Enemy industry, seats of government, <b>factories</b> and <b>communications</b> could be destroyed, taking away their means to resist. It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will, which might lead {{to the collapse of}} production and civil life. Democracies, where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the state, were thought particularly vulnerable. This thinking was prevalent in both the RAF and the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). The policy of RAF Bomber Command became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{retiring}} from the military, Madan began a career in India's rapidly growing high-technology sector, initially with the nation's premier defense electronics public sector company, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). While there, he planned and supervised the construction of BEL’s Radar and <b>Communications</b> <b>factory</b> at Ghaziabad, and became its first General Manager. He later planned and supervised construction of Gujarat Communications and Electronics Limited, a public sector electronics company {{of the state of}} Gujarat. He served as its Chairman and Managing Director for seven years, and remained Chairman for an additional five years.|$|R
500|$|Antony Beevor called Operation Charnwood {{a partial}} success, because {{although}} much of Caen was taken, the British and Canadians failed to secure enough ground to expand the Allied build-up; {{the bulk of the}} First Canadian Army was still waiting in the United Kingdom for transfer to Normandy. Carlo D'Este wrote that Charnwood did improve the Second Army's position but without the high ground to the south, Caen was useless, the capture of the city was too little too late a hollow victory. Chester Wilmot wrote that for Montgomery to maintain a threat to German-occupied Paris, Caen's southern suburbs with their <b>factories</b> and <b>communications</b> network would have been a more significant prize. Buckley and Copp note that by the time the city was captured, the Germans—weakened by the battles of late June and early July—had already established defensive positions on the high ground to the south of the Orne, which blocked the route to the Falaise plain ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} seems {{a simple}} {{method of estimating}} {{what we could do}} by bombing GermanyCareful analysis of the effects of raids on Birmingham, Hull and elsewhere have shown that, on the average, one ton of bombs dropped on a built-up area demolishes 20 - 40 dwellings and turns 100 - 200 people out of house and home.We know from our experience that we can count on nearly fourteen operational sorties per bomber produced. The average lift of the bombers we are going to produce over the next fifteen months will be about 3 tons. It follows that each of these bombers will in its life-time drop about 40 tons of bombs. If these are dropped on built-up areas they will make 4000-8000 people homeless.In 1938 over 22 million Germans lived in fifty-eight towns of over 100,000 inhabitants, which, with modern equipment, should be easy to find and hit. Our forecast output of heavy bombers (including Wellingtons) between now and the middle of 1943 is about 10,000. If even half the total load of 10,000 bombers were dropped on the built-up areas of these fifty-eight German towns the great majority of their inhabitants (about one-third of the German population) would be turned out of house and home.Investigation seems to show that having one's home demolished is most damaging to morale. People seem to mind it more than having their friends or even relatives killed. At Hull signs of strain were evident, though only one-tenth of the houses were demolished. On the above figures {{we should be able to}} do ten times as much harm to each of the fifty-eight principal German towns. There seems little doubt that this would break the spirit of the people.Our calculation assumes, of course, that we really get one-half of our bombs into built-up areas. On the other hand, no account is taken of the large promised American production (6,000 heavy bombers in the period in question). Nor has regard been paid to the inevitable damage to <b>factories,</b> <b>communications,</b> etc, in these towns and the damage by fire, probably accentuated by breakdown of public services.|$|R

40|$|The Horus project {{seeks to}} develop a {{communication}} system addressing the requirements {{of a wide variety}} of distributed applications. Horus implements the group communications model providing (among others) unreliable or reliable FIFO, causal, or total group multicasts. It is extensively layered and highly reconfigurable allowing applications to only pay for services they use. This architecture enables groups with different communication needs to coexist in a single system. The approach permits experimentation with new communication properties and incremental extension of the system, and enables us to support a variety of application-oriented interfaces. Our initial experiments show good performance. 1 Introduction In the last several years, we have seen a growing use of group communication primitives in distributed and/or parallel applications. Physically distributed systems (such as stock markets and <b>factories)</b> employ group <b>communications</b> to disseminate information to large numbers o [...] ...|$|R
