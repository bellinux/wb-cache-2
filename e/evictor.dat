We experimentally studied the dynamics and potential costs of the egg eviction behavior of hatchlings of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus in broods of common redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicurus, a cavity nesting host. Eliminating the labor of egg tossing per se improved the cuckoo chick's growth during the eviction period by ∼ 20 – 30 %. <b>Evictor</b> cuckoo chicks recovered from the cost of egg tossing to fledge at similar masses compared with solitary chicks, although they did so at older ages. Foster parents fed <b>evictor</b> chicks less often compared with nonevictors. Feeding frequencies by hosts to evictors correlated negatively with eviction effort as evicting chicks often appeared to ignore fosterers offering food. Nest cup steepness was negatively related to eviction success and positively to age at first eviction. We propose that eviction behavior by cuckoo hatchlings is favored by selection because the costs of eviction are {{much lower than the}} costs of cohabitation with host chicks.

40|$|Abstract – Today, {{patterns}} {{are used in}} several domains (distributed applications, security, software requirements, architecture…). Our purpose is double: first, to know if existing patterns can be applied in the particular domain of embedded systems middleware; second, to establish the groundings towards a patterns language for that domain. This paper reports on designing and building a lightweight middleware for embedded systems with well known patterns such as Composite, Proxy, Visitor, Observer, Publish/Subscribe, Leasing, <b>Evictor</b> or Configurator. The patterns that we have selected and implemented have allowed keeping the memory footprint reduced. Yet, they were relevant to address the need to create views of networked embedded systems, monitor and manage them. As result, the middleware is modular, flexible, extensible, and lightweight (< 128 kb) according to requirements of targeted embedded systems. In addition, this article describes a concrete case study that illustrates how to select appropriate patterns {{in order to build}} a dedicated middleware to interconnect numerous small devices...|$|E

40|$|Animal {{contests}} {{occur in}} a large variety of taxa. The costs associated with fighting are present regardless of the species, but the costs can be mitigated by considering both your own and your opponent’s resource holding potential (RHP). RHP {{is a measure of}} one’s fighting ability based on a number of fixed and dynamic traits. To this point the element of ‘skill’ has yet to be applied to animal contests or considered as a possible trait of RHP. Skilful fighting tactics could reduce the amount of time and energy invested into a fight as well as potentially increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. This study aimed to bridge the gap in knowledge by closely examining, measuring, and classifying the rapping behaviour that occurs during shell fights between European hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus). It was thought that successful crabs (winners) would perform raps of greater distances than those that were unsuccessful (losers). Additionally, it was found that crabs use two types of raps: ‘pull’ or ‘drag’. Pull style raps were believed to be more advantageous; allowing the attacking crab to move their shell further back. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} there was a strong difference between the average distance of rapping performed by <b>evictors</b> and non-evictors. However, the results were opposite of what was expected, with non-evictors performing further raps on average throughout the fight. The type of rap was also found to have a difference between fight outcomes, with <b>evictors</b> performing a higher percentage of pull style raps. Upon further inspection this was found to be a result of the higher total number of raps performed by <b>evictors.</b> Given the ability of successful individuals to repeatedly “perform precise and or challenging feats of motor coordination” (Earley and Hsu, 2013) their fighting tactics can be classified as skill. Thus, this study helps to support the argument for skill to be included when considering RHP...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chicks of virulent brood {{parasitic}} birds eliminate their nestmates {{and avoid}} costly competition for foster parental care. Yet, efforts to evict nest contents by {{the blind and}} naked common cuckoo Cuculus canorus hatchling are counterintuitive as both adult parasites and large older cuckoo chicks appear to be better suited to tossing the eggs and young of the foster parents. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show experimentally that egg tossing imposed a recoverable growth cost of mass gain in common cuckoo chicks during the nestling period in nests of great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus hosts. Growth rates of skeletal traits and morphological variables involved in the solicitation of foster parental care remained similar between <b>evictor</b> and non-evictor chicks throughout development. We also detected no increase in predation rates for evicting nests, suggesting that egg tossing behavior by common cuckoo hatchlings does not increase the conspicuousness of nests.

40|$|With the {{diverging}} {{improvements in}} CPU speeds and memory access latencies, detecting and removing memory access bottlenecks becomes increasingly important. In this work we present METRIC, a software framework for isolating and understanding such bottlenecks using partial access traces. METRIC extracts access traces from executing programs without special compiler or linker support. We make four primary contributions. First, {{we present a}} framework for extracting partial access traces based on dynamic binary rewriting of the executing application. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm for compressing these traces. The algorithm generates constant space representations for regular accesses occurring in nested loop structures. Third, we use these traces for offline incremental memory hierarchy simulation. We extract symbolic information from the application executable and use this to generate detailed source-code correlated statistics including per-reference metrics, cache <b>evictor</b> information and stream metrics. Finally, we demonstrate how this information {{can be used to}} isolate and understand memory access inefficiencies. This illustrates a potential advantage of METRIC over compile-time analysis for sample codes, particularly when interprocedural analysis is required.

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Assistant Professor Dr. Frank Mueller). Over recent decades, computing speeds have grown much faster than memory ac-cess speeds. This differential rate of improvement between processor speeds and memory speeds {{has led to an}} ever-increasing processor-memory gap. Overall computing speeds for for most applications are now dominated by the cost of their memory references. Further-more, memory access costs will grow increasingly dominant as the processor-memory gap widens. In this scenario, characterizing and quantifying application program memory usage to isolate, identify and eliminate memory access bottlenecks will have significant impact on overall application computing performance. This thesis presents METRIC, an environment for determining memory access inef-ficiencies by examining access traces. This thesis makes three primary contributions.

40|$|Obligate avian brood {{parasitism}} typically involves one of 2 strategies: parasite chicks {{are either}} 1) virulent and evict all other eggs and nest mates {{to be raised}} alone or 2) more tolerant and share foster parental care with host chicks for some or {{the entirety of the}} nestling period. We studied the consequences of experimentally forced mixed broods of age-matched one common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) and 2 great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) chicks. In these broods, both cuckoo and host chicks grew slower than did either individual cuckoos or great reed warblers in broods of 1 parasite or 3 host chicks, respectively. Video records showed that in mixed broods, cuckoo chicks received feedings less frequently than the 33 % predicted by chance at 4 days of age but parental food allocations increased to chance levels at 8 days of age. The consistent patterns of lower growth rates arose even though chicks in broods of 1 parasite and 2 hosts received the largest prey items per feeding. In addition, several other measures of parental provisioning also did not predict species and brood-specific differences in nestling growth rates across the different treatments. However, variation in begging displays and its specific costs on host and parasite chicks in the different nest treatments were not quantified in this study. We conclude that young of nest mate [...] <b>evictor</b> common cuckoos benefit from the sole occupancy of host nests in part owing to an initial competitive disadvantage for parental care in broods with age-matched great reed warbler chicks.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH PAPER OF Dong Yu, for the Master of Arts {{degree in}} Media Theory and Research, {{presented}} on October 28 th, 2013, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: BULLDOZED: IN THE SHADOW OF PROGRESS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Janice Thompson China {{has been the}} fast growing economy in the human history. Since China initiated its “Open Door Policy” {{at the end of}} 1979, {{it has been in the}} fast lane regarding economic development. Tens of thousands of people have started their own business. For much of the population, especially in big cities, living standards have been improved dramatically. Besides the basic necessities, people started to own their own housing properties. It was also the first time that private property trades were allowed since the Communism Party took power in 1949. During the past three decades of reform, many cities have expanded under large-scale reconstruction. New residential communities, shopping malls, office buildings and financial centers are replacing the humble stone houses, courtyards and alleys that characterized old China. In order to acquire land for the new construction sites, it would often involve evicting people from their homes, demolishing old buildings and farmhouses, and occupying farmland. All over China people’s rights are being violated during the process of demolition and eviction. The conflicts between the developer/evictor and the resident/evictee have been intensified due to the lack of due process, fairness and justice in the procedures. This has led to a raised social anxiety. In hopes of easing social instability, on March 16, 2007, The China National People’s Congress passed a controversial law to protect private property rights. It was the first law that gives the owner the right to possess, utilize, dispose of and obtain profits from the real property. This landmark law went into effect on October 1 st, 2007. The documentary followed a group of lawyers on their trips to help villagers from Hexi, in ShanDong Provence, to fight for justice. These villagers were facing forced demolition and eviction. The villagers think that the demolition did not follow the right process [...] through pure arbitrary government behavior, they did not get their fair compensation. It is not a single instance. Illegal demolition occurs so frequently across the country, it has become a serious problem in China. Western media has portrayed China’s glamorous side in its skyrocketing growth and development; however, few have known or noticed the hidden facts, shattered lives, and bitter stories untold in the shadow of these skyscrapers. Bulldozed: in the Shadow of Progress reveals that not only people’s houses are being demolished, but their rights are also being violated. This documentary is structured in two parallels. One aspect shows the unlawful demolition and illegal eviction that happened at Hexi Village in Shandong Province. The villagers were unfairly treated during the process of demolition and eviction and experienced extreme frustration. The other aspect tells the story of new generation of lawyers and people who risked their lives fighting for justice. As the story unfolds it reveals a flawed legal system [...] dysfunctional in protecting people 2 ̆ 7 s rights. During a demolition procedure in the film, when an agreement was not reached between the development company (<b>evictor)</b> and the villagers (evictees), the villagers were harassed by thugs hired by developer and were forced to leave their home. They had no channels to voice their frustration or to seek justice. The experience of this village was not an isolated incident, but a common scenario encountered by tens of millions of Chinese people. As shown in the film, the process of demolition and eviction is arbitrary and lacks due process. Those villagers relied on the land to make a living, but were not treated fairly regarding compensation, job assistance and settlement for relocation. The villagers tried every possible way to protect their rights: they organized themselves, elected their representatives, patrolled the village during the night to fight against thugs, made efforts to appeal to both local and higher authorities, pursued help from professional lawyers, and filed their complaints at the court. However, the cases were not accepted—even after numerous attempts. As a result, no resolution was reached. Villagers were frustrated by the fact that they are considered the “underprivileged party” and thus lack protection by law. Some of the victims lost their hope to live, and even went to the extreme of attempting suicide. On the other hand, the documentary demonstrates the courage, strength and perseverance of three lawyers who fight with those villagers for their rights. They are willing to work on these villagers’ cases in spite of frustration and dilemma. The lawyers defending citizens whose rights are being violated by the government are called “Public Interest Lawyers. ” They often face extreme obstacles in defending their clients, often being harassed by thugs, and detained without legal documents–sometimes even putting their own lives at risk. In China, lawyers are managed under the authority of the Ministry of Justice. To practice law, lawyers need to have their certifications renewed annually from bar associations. Bar associations remain under the control of judicial authorities, which are subject ultimately to the Communist Party. The renewal process has been used as a means to subvert the most outspoken lawyers. The government perceives lawyers who work on politically sensitive cases as either a threat to social stability or a potential embarrassment to the Party rule. Any case that mentions government’s wrongdoings, or disputes against government policy could be considered a politically sensitive case. Many of those out-spoken lawyers are often harassed by plain-clothed policemen, monitored by secret service, even detained and arrested without legal documents. All three lawyers in this film are under surveillance by the Chinese national security bureau for these very reasons. The story of forced demolition that took place in Hexi is served as a vehicle to reveal how the legal system in China is operated under the government, the problem of lack of independence of judicial branch, the frustration and ill-treatment people face in fighting for their rights, the strong will and desire people hold for justice, the courage and the perseverance people demonstrate in search of a better future. The fearlessness of the lawyers and villagers inspired me to work on this project. I believe this documentary is a powerful tool for influencing people. I hope this documentary shows the disappointing reality of law enforcement, spreads the idea of rule of law and calls for greater urgency in reforming legal system in China. Meaningful reform to the legal system in China has lagged behind China’s economic reform, which began more than three decades ago. “China’s GDP growth figure is an impenetrable black box. There’s no way you can actually get behind the numbers and figure out where they came from. ” - Economist Patrick Chovanec. “China’s GDP data is supposed to measure economic activity. So if you build an empty airport, that shows up as an increase in economic activity, but it’s not really an increase in wealth if nobody uses the airport. ” -Beijing-based economist Michael Pettis In 1999, land sales made up just 9...|$|E
