Part-funded by the Department of Health, the group will spend its first two years focusing on tackling six major health inequalities: • Alcohol harm• All age, all cause early mortality • Obesity • Mental health and well-being• Smoking• Teenage pregnancyIn each case, the primary aim of the Core Cities Health Improvement Collaborative is to promote closer collaboration between the cities and their other stakeholders - such as local authorities, other public sector agencies, voluntary sector organisations and user groups. [...] Six learning events are being organised to act as a catalyst for further collaborative working on each topic, while a powerful online knowledge management system ensures all stakeholders can quickly and easily identify and share their experience and materials with each other.To assist with this process, a consortium of private sector partners has been appointed to facilitate the programme.

As an urban-regional geographer, Dr John Harrison has been actively researching England’s urban and regional policies for the past decade, publishing extensively and delivering presentations (keynote or otherwise) to political leaders and policymakers, most recently in Canada, Germany, and UAE 1. In early 2011 he received funding from his institution to conduct an independent study into Local Enterprise Partnerships – joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> to support <b>local</b> economic development across ‘functional economies’. Extending previous research {{on the evolution of}} city-regionalism in England, this research project was uniquely positioned to offer an ‘in retrospect’, ‘in snapshot’ and ‘in prospect’ take on the establishment of LEPs as the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Government’s chosen model for subnational governance. The research was conducted at a time of transition: Regional Assemblies had been abolished; Government Offices for the Regions and Regional Development Agencies were being wound down; various rounds of LEP announcements had seen 35 LEPs approved/established; first round decisions for the Regional Growth Fund (RGF) had just been announced; the first round of Enterprise Zones (EZ) had been announced.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature of {{strategic}} turnaround in English local authorities {{during the period of}} Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) between 2002 and 2008. This period was unique in that it allowed the comparative performance of local authorities and their management practices using the holistic performance management framework of the CPA. Specifically, this study focuses on a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> that were poorly performing at the start of CPA era, but had sustained improved performance by the end. It aims to establish the turnaround approaches adopted by this <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> the impact of leadership {{and the extent to which}} the approaches adopted promoted sustained turnaround. Publicly available CPA information and interviews with senior officers of turnaround councils and government lead officials are used to classify and analyse the changes in strategic processes. The thesis adopts a case study approach within a managerialist perspective and identifies ten approaches to turnaround that can be related to a longitudinal " 7 Rs"� framework adapting the work of Boyne (2004) and others. This has been developed to include Realisation and Reinforcement at either end of the turnaround period. Realisation is required to kick-start the turnaround process and Reinforcement to embed the organisational changes necessary to sustain improvement over the longer term. Leadership is a key aspect throughout the process, both in terms of introducing new leaders and the adoption of new leadership approaches to support and underpin sustainable organisational improvement. Sustained improvement was found to be achievable by poorly performing councils. The study also concludes that there was a continuing influence of managerialism, originally associated with new public management, throughout the CPA era...|$|E
40|$|In 2010, an {{integrated}} Leadership, Management and Safeguarding training programme for adult and children's services managers {{was created by}} a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and a local university. Following Lord Laming (Department of Health, 2003 and Laming, 2009), the emerging reports of Munro (2010) and the Social Work Task Force (Department for Children, Schools and Families, 2009) called for increased emphasis on supervision as a key mechanism for safeguarding children, and by implication, adults. Therefore on this course two different means for candidates to address issues of supervision and explore their practice were included: a discussion board, and a critical friend exercise using video. A feature of the programme was the learning and understanding which developed from adults and children's sectors learning together. The work on supervision provided a shared space in which all could participate. Feedback indicates that the two methods were both valued in different ways for the opportunity they provided for exploring supervision and enhancing reflective practice. This article is a reflection {{by one of the}} course tutors on the methods used and the value of both adult and children's managers participating together...|$|E
40|$|A Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) is {{the amount}} which {{government}} considers appropriate for a local authority to set as its annual budget requirement. Each assessment is composed of revenues calculated for a discrete set of service blocks where the local unit costs of service provision are most often estimated by means of regression procedures that {{have been subject to}} regular scrutiny and review. Set against this context, in this paper the authors evaluate the performance of the regressions that contribute to the calculation of SSAs as equitable allocation devices. The general accounting framework for constructing SSAs is described and a statistical classification of the regression models is presented. In their analysis the authors examine a selection of models that are representative of each class and they include the regressions that comprise the Other District Services and Personal Social Services blocks. These appraisals follow a common sequence where a dummy variable is entered into the regression to test the consistency of the allocation made to a specified <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> When the dummy variable is statistically significant, revisions to the specification of the regression are either tested or suggested. Finally, the broader implications of these findings for the design of SSAs are examined. ...|$|E

40|$|This study explores why {{progress}} with tackling health inequalities has varied among a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> areas in England that were set targets to narrow important health outcomes compared to national averages. It focuses on premature deaths from cancers and cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{and whether the}} <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> gap for these outcomes narrowed. Survey and secondary data were used to create dichotomised conditions describing each area. For cancers, ten conditions {{were found to be}} associated with whether or not narrowing occurred: presence/absence of a working culture of individual commitment and champions; spending on cancer programmes; aspirational or comfortable/complacent organisational cultures; deprivation; crime; assessments of strategic partnership working, commissioning and the public health workforce; frequency of progress reviews; and performance rating <b>of</b> the <b>local</b> Primary Care Trust (PCT). For CVD, six conditions were associated with whether or not narrowing occurred: a PCT budget closer or further away from target; assessments of primary care services, smoking cessation services and <b>local</b> leadership; presence/absence <b>of</b> a few major programmes; and population turnover. The method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis was used to find configurations of these conditions with either the narrowing or not narrowing outcomes. Narrowing cancer gaps were associated with three configurations in which individual commitment and champions was a necessary condition, and not narrowing was associated with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> conditions that had in common a high level of bureaucratic-type work. Narrowing CVD gaps were associated with three configurations in which a high assessment of either primary care or smoking cessation services was a necessary condition, and not narrowing was associated with two configurations that both included an absence of major programmes. The article considers substantive and theoretical arguments for these configurations being causal and as pointing to ways of improving {{progress with}} tackling health inequalities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} causes and {{circumstances}} surrounding fatal accidents involving head injuries in children in the Northern region. DESIGN [...] Retrospective review of the hospital case notes, necropsy reports, and records of the coroners' inquests. SETTING [...] Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS [...] All 255 children aged less than 16 years who died with a head injury during 1979 - 86. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cause of injury and circumstances of accident according to reports of inquests; injury severity score; number of fatal accidents and mortality per 100, 000 children in 10 <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> wards ranked according to their score on the overall deprivation index; and distance of site of accident from child's home. RESULTS [...] Of the 255 children who died after a head injury, 136 (53 %) children were playing {{at the time of}} the accident. 195 (76 %) children sustained the head injury in road traffic accidents, 135 as pedestrians, 35 as cyclists, and 25 as passengers in a vehicle. In 120 accidents in child pedestrians the primary cause of accident was the unsafe behaviour of the child. 172 (67 %) accidents occurred within one to two km of the child's home and 153 (63 %) between 3 pm and 9 pm. The mortality was significantly related to social deprivation; excluding eight children injured while on holiday in the region, 15 -fold decrease in mortality was recorded between the <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> wards that ranked highest on the overall deprivation index and those that ranked lowest (14. 0 / 100, 000 children, group 10 v 0. 9 / 100, 000, group 1 respectively, p less than 0. 00001). CONCLUSIONS [...] The finding that most accidents occurred in children living in deprived areas who were playing unsupervised near their home suggests that childhood mortality might be appreciably reduced if children at play were protected from traffic, particularly in socially deprived areas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an initial investigation into the expenditure responses of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> in England to a loss in grant income. The Government has restricted grant aid to local authorities in an attempt to secure restraint in the expenditure of these authorities, but (until recently) local authorities {{have had the opportunity to}} make good any loss in grant income by increasing local taxes. A central issue is, then, how much restraint in local authority expenditure is secured by a given reduction in grant aid. Reduction in grant aid is measured in this paper in terms of its impact on the local tax rate (and the average local domestic tax bill) if a local authority is to maintain the real value of its spending. An incremental budgeting type model is developed and the empirical work is concerned with the financial years 1982 - 1983 and 1984 - 1985. It is found that in the later year local authorities have been less willing to reduce their expenditure in the face of loss of grant aid. It is also found that the response of the local authorities has become more political in the sense that a statistically significant difference has developed between the responses of Labour and those of non-Labour controlled councils. ...|$|E
40|$|Kanban is a one of {{the lean}} {{approaches}} adopted within the industry in order to pull construction materials through their production systems on a just-in-time basis. The approach is developed in the automotive industry and now being widely implemented within the construction industry with many success stories. The objective {{of this approach is}} to accomplish management of products and materials with least waste; e. g., unnecessary inventories and processing time, waiting time, as well as physical waste. The primary means for achieving the objective is to simplify the processes of acquiring, storing, distributing and disposing of selected products and material on site. This paper talks about a particular type of kanban, called supplier kanban. The supplier kanban is the one which transmits a replenishment signal to outside suppliers and from suppliers to manufacturers of the products as well as signal for delivery of material just-in-time on the construction site. Here the author talks about a material management strategy adopted by Fusion 21, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and housing association that use supplier kanbans to signal the need for delivery of selected products from preferred suppliers and manufacturers to site just-in-time for the operations and maintenance of their social housing stocks.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{administration}} of permanent exclusion from school within an urban children's services department. It focuses on two areas: what contributes to instances of permanent exclusion from school, and what the effects are of its existence as a disciplinary option. I suspected {{that the existence of}} permanent exclusion from school might limit the realm of the possible, and I was particularly interested in how and why local government officers made particular decisions about children and young people. In other words, I wondered whether professionals might be negatively affected by the fact that at some point they would have the option of excluding a young person rather than either continuing to try to help them or to attempt to change the institution's approach to educating them. Rather than focusing on what children and young people 'did' behaviourally to 'get excluded', the thesis adopts a Foucauldian analysis to concentrate on their place within a larger 'policy community' which includes professionals and policy makers. The research was undertaken through an ethnographic methodology conducted within my place of work as a pupil support officer, and the fieldwork itself lasted two years. Because I was participant-observing within a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> staff, and was interested in local government decision-making, I have largely framed my approach as an exercise in `studying up' on powerful organisations. So in order to support an informed approach to ameliorating social inequity, the thesis looks at the ways in which powerful institutions work. This has implications for the `voices' of the young people subject to or at the risk of permanent exclusion from school both in school and in the research. My findings suggest a broad, deep and opaque seam of institutional prejudice in a range of areas. They point towards the idea that instances of permanent exclusion from school are partially caused or exacerbated by institutional prejudice. Permanent exclusion from school can also be seen to intensify the effects of institutional prejudice...|$|R
