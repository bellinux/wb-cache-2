I desire a band of six men on whom I can rely for an {{adventure}} which promises large profit. Don't suppose that I am going to lead you to petty robberies on the road, in which, as you learned to your cost the other day, one sometimes gets more hard knocks than profit. Such adventures may do for petty knaves, {{but they are not}} suited to me. The way to get wealthy is to strike at the rich. My idea is to establish some place in an out of the way quarter where there is no fear of prying neighbours, and to carry off and hide there {{the sons and daughters of}} wealthy men and put them to ransom. In the first instance I am going to undertake a private affair of my own; and as you will really run no risk in the matter, for I shall separate myself from you after making my capture, I shall pay you only a <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> of twenty crowns each. In future affairs we shall act upon the principle of shares. I shall take three shares, a friend who works with me will take two shares, and you shall take one share apiece. The risk will really be entirely mine, for I shall take charge of the captives we make at our rendezvous. You, after lending a hand in the capture, will return here and hold yourself in readiness to join me, and carry out another capture as soon as I have made all the necessary arrangements. Thus, if by any chance we are tracked, I alone and my friend will run the risk of capture and punishment. In that way we may, in the course of a few months, amass a much larger booty than we should in a lifetime spent in these wretched adventures upon travellers.|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#1] The “Tayyarah,” or “Flying Caravan,” {{is lightly}} laden, and travels by forced marches. [FN#2] This “Musafahah,” {{as it is}} called, is the Arab fashion of shaking hands. They apply the palms of the right hands flat to each other, without {{squeezing}} the fingers, and then raise the hand to the forehead. [FN#3] On this occasion I heard three new words: “Kharitah,” used to signify a single trip to Meccah (without return to Al-Madinah), “Ta’arifah,” going out from Meccah to Mount Arafat, and “Tanzilah,” return from Mount Arafat to Meccah. [FN#4] And part of an extra animal which was to carry water for the party. Had we travelled by the Darb al-Sultani, we should have paid 6½ dollars, instead of 10, for each beast. [FN#5] The system of advances, as well as <b>earnest</b> <b>money,</b> is common all over Arabia. In some places, Aden for instance, I have heard of two-thirds {{the price of a}} cargo of coffee being required from the purchaser before the seller would undertake to furnish a single bale. [FN#6] Most men of the Shafe’i school clip their mustachios exceedingly short; some clean shave the upper lip, the imperial, and the parts of the beard about the corners of the mouth, and the forepart of the cheeks. I neglected so to do, which soon won for me the epithet recorded above. Arabs are vastly given to “nick-naming God’s creatures”; their habit is the effect of acute observation, and the want of variety in proper names. Sonnini appears not to like having been called the “Father of a nose.” But there is nothing disrespectful in these personal allusions. In Arabia you must be “father” of something, and it is better to be father of a feature, than father of a cooking pot, or father of a strong smell (“Abu-Zirt.”) [FN#7] Salt among the Hindus is considered the essence and preserver of the seas; it was therefore used in their offerings to the gods. The old idea in Europe was, that salt is a body composed of various elements, into which it cannot be resolved by human means: hence, it became the type of an indissoluble tie between individuals. Homer calls salt sacred and divine, and whoever ate it with a stranger was supposed to become his friend. By the Greek authors, as by the Arabs, hospitality and salt are words expressing a kindred idea. When describing the Badawin of Al-Hijaz, I shall have occasion to notice their peculiar notions of the Salt-law. [FN#8] The import of such articles shows the march of progress in Al-Hijaz. During the last generation, schoolmasters used for pencils bits of bar lead beaten to a point. [FN#9] The “two comforts” are success and despair; the latter, according to the Arabs, being a more enviable state of feeling than doubt or hope deferred.|$|E

5000|$|One {{distinctive}} feature of {{residential real estate}} contract forms promulgated by the Commission is the [...] "termination option." [...] The termination option paragraph of the contract gives a potential Buyer, in return for paying an [...] "option fee" [...] to the Seller, the unrestricted right to terminate the contract by giving notice of termination to the Seller within {{a certain number of}} days after the effective date of the negotiated contract. The number of days and the amount of the option fee, like sales price and <b>earnest</b> <b>money,</b> are among those features negotiated between a Seller and potential Buyer in the sale contract; in Texas, option fees typically range from $100 to $200, while <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> ranges from one to several thousand dollars. Option fees are paid directly to the Seller and are only refundable at closing, while <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> in Texas is typically paid to and held in escrow by title insurance companies for the Seller; <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> is either paid to the Seller or refunded to a potential Buyer, depending on a number of factors.|$|E

50|$|A {{potential}} buyer of property of high value such as {{residential real estate}} generally signs a contract and pays a sum acceptable to the seller by way of <b>earnest</b> <b>money.</b> The amount varies enormously, depending upon local custom {{and the state of}} the local market at the time of contract negotiations.|$|E
5000|$|Once an {{investment}} property has been located, and preliminary due diligence (investigation and verification {{of the condition}} and status of the property) completed, the investor will have to negotiate a sale price and sale terms with the seller, then execute a contract for sale. Most investors employ real estate agents and real estate attorneys {{to assist with the}} acquisition process, as it can be quite complex and improperly executed transactions can be very costly. During the acquisition of a property, an investor will typically make a formal offer to buy including payment of [...] "earnest money" [...] to the seller at the start of negotiation to reserve the investor's rights to complete the transaction if price and terms can be satisfactorily negotiated. This <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> {{may or may not be}} refundable, and is considered to be a signal of the seriousness of the investor's intent to purchase. The terms of the offer will also usually include a number of contingencies which allow the investor time to complete due diligence, inspect the property and obtain financing among other requirements prior to final purchase. Within the contingency period, the investor usually has the right to rescind the offer with no penalty and obtain a refund of <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> deposits. Once contingencies have expired, rescinding the offer will usually require forfeiture of the <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> deposits and may involve other penalties as well.|$|E
50|$|When the {{transaction}} is settled then the deposit {{is applied to}} the buyer's portion of the remaining costs. If the offer is rejected, the <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> is usually returned, since no binding contract has been entered into. Laws vary as to what happens with the deposit should the buyer fail to perform on the contract.|$|E
50|$|Although {{money is}} the most common consideration, it is not a {{required}} element to have a valid real estate contract. An <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> deposit from the buyer(s) customarily accompanies an offer to buy real estate and the deposit is held by a third party, like a title company, attorney or sometimes the seller. The amount, {{a small fraction of the}} total price, is listed in the contract, with the remainder of the cost to be paid at the closing. In some rare cases, other instruments of value, like notes and/or stock or other negotiable instruments can be used for consideration. Other hard assets, like gold, silver and anything of value can also be used or in other cases, love (where it can be shown to have existed between the parties). However, the <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> deposit represents a credit towards the final sales price, which is usually the main or only consideration.|$|E
5000|$|In very {{competitive}} markets 'the earnest' {{may represent a}} substantial portion of the completion cost. In the USA, between about 2000 and 2005 real estate purchase <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> deposits reached about 5% of the sales price. In other situations, a significant token payment (equivalent to around one week or one month's salary) may be acceptable. (In the USA during 2008 typically $500 or $1000 was acceptable) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{commingling}} {{is of particular}} concern in the legal profession. Attorneys are strictly prohibited from commingling their clients' funds with their own, and such activity is grounds for disbarment in virtually every jurisdiction, because of the ease of embezzlement {{and the difficulty of}} detection. Similar rules apply for licensed real estate brokers handling <b>earnest</b> <b>money</b> and other professionals who hold deposits as agents for clients in absentia.|$|E

At a meeting on August 21, 2006, the city council of Paternos decided to abandon plans to purchase the house even though the state Department of Transportation had provided a $140,000 grant to use toward its purchase.|$|E
