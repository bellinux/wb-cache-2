5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E
5|$|The voice {{once again}} speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must {{be cut off}} from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife {{from the kitchen and}} walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto <b>his</b> <b>wall,</b> which becomes the title screen.|$|E

25|$|To {{keep the}} wall clock {{in sync with}} the {{reference}} clock, each week the owner compares the time on <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> clock to a more accurate clock (a phase comparison), and he resets his clock. Left alone, the wall clock will continue to diverge from the reference clock at the same few seconds per hour rate.|$|E
25|$|Reliefs, as {{it turned}} out, was the perfect medium for his work given that this style of artistic display is {{historic}} in nature and therefore well-suited to Al-Zahawi’s art that itself evokes an ancient and mysterious aura. He began to try his hands at various relief sizes, sketching each block, and masterfully bringing his sketches to life. Through this experiment {{he was able to}} open up his work to a whole new audience that appreciated and actively acquired <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> mounted ceramic art.|$|E
25|$|Tradem's {{collected}} short stories, Refractarii ("The Fracticious Ones"), portrays various misfit characters, and its subjects occasionally {{turn to the}} macabre. In one of them, {{the protagonist}} Costin is shown to be heartbroken when a malicious child destroys his favorite flower. In one other novella, a medicine student steals the corpse of a beautiful woman from the morgue, and hangs her skeleton on <b>his</b> <b>wall.</b> Various of his stories and essays also compliment cultural figures whose works Tradem enjoyed. Alongside mentions of Chopin and Weber, they reference Edgar Allan Poe, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Camille Saint-Saëns.|$|E

25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> clock's {{time to the}} reference time, he noticed that his clock was too fast. Consequently, he could turn the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work out right, his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).|$|E
25|$|Khosrow's reign marked an {{expansion}} in building. Khosrow constructed {{a number of}} walls on his frontiers to protect from nomadic incursions {{as well as other}} enemies. On the southeast frontier he built a wall called the Wall of the Arabs in order to prevent Arab nomads from raiding his empire. In the northeast he built a wall to protect the interior of his empire from the Hephthalite and Turkish threat that was growing on his border. <b>His</b> <b>wall</b> building campaign was also extended into the Caucasus region where he built massive walls at Derbent.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 Kelly began {{regularly}} making large-scale outdoor sculpture. Kelly gave up painted surfaces, instead choosing unvarnished steel, aluminum or bronze, {{often in}} totem-like configurations such as Curve XXIII (1981). While the totemic forms of his freestanding sculptures can {{measure up to}} 15 feet tall, <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> reliefs can span more than 14 feet wide. Kelly’s sculpture “is founded on its adherence to absolute simplicity and clarity of form.” For his 1980s sculptures, {{during this period of}} his time in Spencertown, the artist devoted {{for the first time as}} much energy to his sculptures as to his painting, and in the process producing over sixty percent of his total 140 sculptures.|$|E

25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 2nd century, Londinium had many large, well-equipped stone buildings, some of which were richly adorned with wall {{paintings}} and floor mosaics, and had subfloor hypocausts. The Roman house at Billingsgate was built next to the waterfront and had its own bath. In addition to such structures reducing the city's building density, however, Londinium also seems to have shrunk in both size and population in {{the second half}} of the 2nd century. The cause is uncertain but plague is considered likely, as the Antonine Plague is recorded decimating other areas of Western Europe between 165 and 190. The end of imperial expansion in Britain after Hadrian's decision to build <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> may have also damaged the city's economy. Although Londinium remained important for the rest of the Roman period, no further expansion occurred. Londinium remained well populated as archaeologists have found that much of the city after this date was covered in dark earth, one that accumulated relatively undisturbed for centuries.|$|E

Cobain claimed he was unaware that it was a brand of deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted the slogan as having revolutionary meaning, as they had been discussing anarchism, punk rock, and similar topics.|$|E

500|$|In the 19th century, Vincent van Gogh {{acknowledged}} Ruisdael {{as a major}} influence, {{calling him}} sublime, {{but at the same}} time saying it would be a mistake to try to copy him. Van Gogh had two Ruisdael prints, The Bush and a Haerlempje, on <b>his</b> <b>wall,</b> and thought the Ruisdaels in the Louvre were [...] "magnificent, especially The Bush, The Breakwater and The Ray of Light". His experience of the French countryside was informed by his memory of Ruisdael's art. Van Gogh's contemporary Claude Monet is also said to be indebted to Ruisdael. Even Piet Mondriaan's minimalism has been traced back to Ruisdael's panoramas.|$|E
500|$|The Wall is a rock opera that explores {{abandonment}} and isolation, symbolised by {{a metaphorical}} wall. The songs create an approximate storyline {{of events in}} the life of the protagonist, Pink, a character based on Syd Barrett as well as Roger Waters, whose father was killed during the Second World War. Pink is oppressed by his overprotective mother, and tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers. All of these traumas become metaphorical [...] "bricks in the wall". The protagonist eventually becomes a rock star, his relationships marred by infidelity, drug use, and outbursts of violence. As his marriage crumbles, he finishes building <b>his</b> <b>wall,</b> completing his isolation from human contact.|$|E
500|$|All Things Must Pass was {{critically}} and commercially successful on release, {{with long}} stays at number 1 on charts around the world. The album was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs <b>his</b> <b>Wall</b> of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as [...] "Wagnerian, Brucknerian, {{the music of}} mountain tops and vast horizons". Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, Melody Makers Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: [...] "Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!" [...] According to Colin Larkin, writing in the 2011 edition of his Encyclopedia of Popular Music, All Things Must Pass is [...] "generally rated" [...] as {{the best of all}} the former Beatles' solo albums.|$|E

500|$|In a final meeting, a {{disappointed}} Lipnick, {{in uniform}} (as {{he attempts to}} secure an Army Reserve commission), angrily chastises Barton for writing [...] "a fruity movie about suffering" [...] then informs him that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Barton will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes so he can be ridiculed as a loser around the studio while Lipnick is in the war. Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks {{just like the one}} in the picture on <b>his</b> <b>wall</b> at the Earle, and she asks about the box.

500|$|Hidden behind <b>his</b> <b>wall,</b> Pink becomes {{severely}} depressed. In {{order to}} get him to perform, a doctor medicates him. This results in a hallucinatory on-stage performance where he believes that he is a fascist dictator performing at concerts similar to Neo-Nazi rallies, at which he sets brownshirts-like men on fans he considers unworthy. [...] Upon realizing the horror of what he has done, Pink becomes overwhelmed and wishes for everything around him to cease. Showing human emotion, he is tormented with guilt and places himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to [...] "tear down the wall", opening Pink to the outside world. The album turns full circle with its closing words [...] "Isn't this where ...", the first words of the phrase that begins the album, [...] "... we came in?", with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters' theme.|$|E
500|$|The group's ranks {{began to}} {{materialize}} {{in the late}} 1950s, {{but in the early}} 1960s they fully coalesced into what became their most recognizable form when they became the de facto house band for Phil Spector, playing on many of the hits that he produced at the time, and contributing to the development of <b>his</b> <b>Wall</b> of Sound production methods. After the initial success of Spector's records, they became the most requested session musicians in Los Angeles, playing behind many popular recording artists such as Jan & Dean, Sonny & Cher, Barry McGuire, The Mamas & the Papas, Frank Sinatra, and Nancy Sinatra. They were sometimes used as [...] "ghost players" [...] on recordings credited to rock groups, such as the Byrds' debut hit rendition of Bob Dylan's [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] (1965), the first two albums by the Monkees, and [...] the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966).|$|E
