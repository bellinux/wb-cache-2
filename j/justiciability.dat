The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of <b>justiciability</b> is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Judicial Commissioner Menon also {{mentioned}} another {{exception to the}} <b>justiciability</b> rule: when the courts are able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. However, the judge did not explain this exception further, {{and it has not}} yet been applied or discussed in any other Singapore case.|$|E
5|$|Mullen {{suggests}} that {{the failure of the}} Attorney General to challenge either standing or <b>justiciability</b> in the case could have wider implications by lowering the barriers to litigation and also by providing a precedent that people acting in their personal capacities can challenge the validity of primary legislation.|$|E
5|$|The law {{relating}} to <b>justiciability</b> was discussed comprehensively by Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon in the High Court decision Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co. Ltd. (2007). After examining {{a line of}} cases, the judge laid down the following principles.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. <b>Justiciability</b> recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the <b>justiciability</b> of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of {{decision-making}} power. This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E
5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the <b>justiciability</b> of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Justiciability</b> depends not on {{the source}} of the {{decision-making}} power, but on the subject-matter that is in question. Where it is the executive that has access to the best materials available to resolve the issue, its views should be regarded as highly persuasive, if not decisive.|$|E

500|$|Judicial Commissioner Menon {{rejected}} a highly rigid and categorical approach to determining the <b>justiciability</b> of an issue, because {{the theory of}} the separation of powers is to be interpreted and applied sensibly. The intensity of the review depends on the context behind it and upon common sense. This was the approach taken in Marchiori v. Environment Agency (2002) which noted that [...] "one context will shade into another". He highlighted four principles that bear noting when determining whether an issue is justiciable: ...|$|E
500|$|One of the Parliament's {{justifications}} for restricting judicial review {{in response to}} Chng Suan Tze was that national security is [...] "not a judicial decision" [...] and is not capable of [...] "objective evaluation by the courts". Commentators have noted, though, {{that the role of}} the court as enunciated in Chng Suan Tze is merely to be convinced that there is a national security issue at hand, not to inquire into the executive action required to preserve it. In fact, the court applied the doctrine of <b>justiciability</b> which recognizes that the limits of judicial review in politically sensitive issues is better left to the discretion of the executive.|$|E
500|$|<b>Justiciability</b> {{was applied}} as a {{threshold}} issue in Singapore in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988). Here, the appellants {{were arrested for}} allegedly being involved in a Marxist conspiracy to undermine the Government, and were issued detention orders under section8(1)(a) of the Internal Security Act. The respondents submitted that [...] "as the subject matter in ss 8 and 10 of the ISA relates to matters of national security the court is precluded from reviewing the exercising of such discretion since matters of national security {{should be left to}} those responsible for it." [...] The Court of Appeal agreed with this submission, stating that while an exercise of discretion is generally subject to judicial review on objective grounds, a court will be precluded from reviewing a decision that was made for national security purposes. This position was consistent with the holdings in The Zamora (1916) and the GCHQ case.|$|E
500|$|While Section 2 and Section 5 {{prohibit}} jurisdictions from drawing electoral {{districts that}} dilute {{the votes of}} protected minorities, the Supreme Court has held that in some instances, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities. The Court first recognized the <b>justiciability</b> of affirmative [...] "racial gerrymandering" [...] claims in Shaw v. Reno (1993). In Miller v. Johnson (1995), the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the [...] "predominant factor" [...] in determining how to draw district lines. For race to [...] "predominate", the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles, which include [...] "compactness, contiguity, [...] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests." [...] If a court concludes that racial considerations predominated, then the redistricting plan is considered [...] "racially gerrymandered" [...] and must be subjected to strict scrutiny, meaning that the redistricting plan will be upheld as constitutional {{only if it is}} narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. In Bush v. Vera (1996), a plurality of the Supreme Court assumed that complying with Section 2 or Section 5 constituted compelling interests, and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, {{the rules}} {{recognize}} that adjudication within an adversary system functions {{best in the}} presence of [...] "a lively conflict" [...] between actively pressed antagonistic demands, making resolution of the controverted issue a practical necessity. Frankfurter termed the <b>justiciability</b> doctrines of standing, ripeness, and mootness as merely [...] "several manifestations... of the primary conception that federal judicial power is to be exercised to strike down legislation... only at the instance of one who is himself immediately harmed, or immediately threatened with harm, by the challenged action." [...] The first two rules of the avoidance doctrine are, thus, closely linked to well-recognized <b>justiciability</b> requirements, and serve as alternative, but not distinctive, limitations on the federal judicial power.|$|E
2500|$|The proposition's proponents filed a {{petition}} for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on July 30, 2012, requesting that the Supreme Court review the case. [...] Briefs in opposition {{both from the}} individual respondents and from the City and County of San Francisco were filed August 24, and the petitioners replied on September 4. On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court granted the proponents' petition for certiorari and asked to be briefed for arguments concerning the petitioners' Article III standing, amid considerable anticipation of a finding {{of a lack of}} <b>justiciability</b> in order to avoid a holding on the merits. Oral arguments were heard on March 26, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Standing, another <b>justiciability</b> {{doctrine}} {{derived from}} the [...] "case or controversy" [...] requirement, requires a litigant to allege that she has personally suffered or imminently will suffer a concrete injury, fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and that the court's decision will likely redress her injury. Standing includes both constitutional and prudential components. [...] The third rule of the avoidance doctrine requires federal courts facing constitutional issues to rule no more broadly than the precise facts require. This rule may reflect the fact-specific focus of the standing inquiry. The fifth rule, which requires that the challenged legislation injure the plaintiff, mirrors the injury and causation components of the standing requirement.|$|E
2500|$|Brandeis {{characterized}} {{judicial review}} of the constitutionality of legislative acts as a grave and delicate power for use by fallible, human judges only when its use cannot conscientiously be avoided. [...] This reluctance to {{use the power of}} judicial review was, according to Brandeis, predicated on the separation of powers principle that one branch must not [...] "encroach upon the domain of another." [...] Brandeis identified two prominent limitations on the federal judicial power based on the separation principle: the [...] "case or controversy" [...] requirement and the rule that federal courts have no power to render advisory opinions. Brandeis linked a host of <b>justiciability</b> doctrines, including political question and standing inquiries, to these limitations.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{rule of the}} {{avoidance}} doctrine mirrors the ripeness requirement in that it obliges federal courts to refrain from deciding a dispute prematurely. The primary rationale for the ripeness doctrine, another <b>justiciability</b> doctrine arising from the case or controversy requirement, is [...] "to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements." [...] In a leading case on ripeness, Poe v. Ullman, the Court relied on {{the avoidance}} doctrine {{to set the stage}} for its decision that the controversy was not ripe. In Poe, Justice Felix Frankfurter described the Ashwander rules as arising from the [...] "historically defined, limited nature and function of courts" [...] and from the separation of powers principle.|$|E
2500|$|Cases construing the {{prudential}} {{component of}} the standing doctrine have relied on the avoidance doctrine. Prudence gives rise to, among other doctrines, the prohibition against third-party standing. One policy underlying the prohibition is the desire to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication. The Court, in explicating the bar against third-party standing, has described Brandeis' Ashwander rules as [...] "offering the standing requirement as one means by which courts avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudications." [...] A second prudential restriction is the bar against finding standing for a generalized grievance— a harm shared in substantially equal measure by all or {{a large group of}} citizens. The Court has also linked this standing bar to the avoidance doctrine: the requirement of an individualized injury serves to ensure that [...] "there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review {{in order to protect the}} interests of the complaining party." [...] Indeed, the avoidance doctrine may be an early formulation of the <b>justiciability</b> doctrines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first rule}} bars collusive suits as not proper cases or controversies under Article III. Brandeis relied on Atherton Mills v. Johnston, {{in which the}} Court {{dismissed}} a challenge to a congressional act regulating child labor as moot, {{in support of the}} first rule. As Professor Alexander Bickel points out, however, Atherton Mills was [...] "a case of quite conventional mootness, hardly apt as an illustration of judicial self-restraint in constitutional litigation." [...] Mootness, a <b>justiciability</b> doctrine, serves to ensure that a controversy is [...] "live" [...] and in need of judicial resolution. For Brandeis, however, Atherton Mills represented the issue of collusive suits arranged to obtain fast and convenient adjudication of constitutional issues. Brandeis elaborated on this concern in Ashwander, declaring judicial review of the constitutionality of legislative acts legitimate only as a last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversies between individuals. It was never the thought that a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts, by means of a friendly suit, an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.|$|E
2500|$|Issuance of a writ is an {{exercise}} of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the 1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, [...] "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before {{it so that the}} Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, <b>justiciability</b> of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words [...] "in an unlawful manner" [...] implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.|$|E
