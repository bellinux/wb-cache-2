The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of our modifications, which included (1) use of an Alexis wound retractor (Applied Medical) to secure the surgical field through a small incision, and (2) use of a 12 -mm, 1 / 2 R, <b>insert-molded</b> taper needle with 3 - 0 nylon suture to prevent damage to the arytenoid cartilage. Study DesignThis is a retrospective non-randomized observational cross-sectional study. MethodsWe compared the operative time and skin incision length between the conventional fenestration approach and our modified procedure, and verified the improvement of patients' voice by our procedure. ResultsSeven patients underwent the conventional fenestration approach for arytenoid adduction with type I thyroplasty, whereas nine patients underwent our modified fenestration approach for arytenoid adduction with type I thyroplasty. The skin incision length with our modifications (median, 3. 0 [*]cm; interquartile range [IQR], 3. 0 – 4. 0) was significantly shorter than with the conventional procedure (median, 5. 0 [*]cm; IQR, 4. 3 – 5. 8) (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). The operative time with our modifications (median, 95 minutes; IQR, 90 – 100) was significantly shorter than without our modifications (median, 115; IQR, 100 – 130) (P[*]=[*] 0. 035). All patients who underwent our modified fenestration approach for arytenoid adduction had maximum phonation time greater than 11 seconds after surgery. ConclusionsOur two distinctive modifications reduced the operative time and skin incision length for the fenestration approach, which improved the procedure by making it less invasive...|$|E
