5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> covered the {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder. There {{they found the}} foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and {{said that in the}} night they had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{other major}} {{influence}} was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth {{is a single}} living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book Gaia: A new look at life on Earth. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills 4yard line, but were unable to score and {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up what would be a potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards. A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E

25|$|The {{town was}} founded as an unincorporated village and {{named after the}} yellow prairie <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> {{surrounds}} the area.

25|$|Pastures {{should be}} rotated when plants are grazed down to avoid {{overgrazing}} or deterioration of pasture quality. Manure management is also improved by pasture rotation; horses will not eat <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> contains {{too much of}} their own manure and such areas are {{a breeding ground for}} parasites. Decomposition of the manure needs to be allowed while the horses are kept in an alternative paddock.|$|E

In tallgrass prairie there are four dominant species, big bluestem grass (Andropogen gerardii), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Big bluestem grass is 4–8 feet tall and was the favorite food of the buffalo.|$|E

Callaloo, when boiled and served daily, kept the crews of Centaur and Sophie from scurvy and was a nice addition to a menu too long dominated by salt beef.|$|E

She ran over that distance at the Hyogo Relays meet and had three straight wins from 2005 to 2007. She finished tenth in 5000 metres at the 2005 World Athletics Final. Wangui made her international debut on <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> year at the 2005 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where her fifth-place finish in the short race made the Kenyan team a close second to Ethiopia in the team rankings.|$|E
25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In ecotone habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green <b>grass</b> <b>that</b> is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When {{they have access to}} enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use , such as termite mounds, to {{get a good look at}} their surroundings.|$|E
