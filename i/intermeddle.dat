2500|$|Some {{say that}} before the {{creation}} of the Duchy, the assets of the Earl of Cornwall (including privileges such as bailiff rights, stannaries and wrecks) were subject to Crown escheat, {{as in the case of}} Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall (died 1300). However, records contained within the foreshore dispute papers show that entry into Cornwall for the King's Escheator was often barred on grounds that the King's writ does not run in Cornwall. For example, records of the Launceston Eyre of 1284 show Edmund successfully resisting the King's attempted assertion of escheat rights over Cornwall. Edmund's advocate opened his plea with the words, [...] "my liege lord hols Corrnwall above the Lord King in Chief....so the Escheator of the Lord the King shall not <b>intermeddle</b> in anything belonging to the Sheriff of Cornwall". That same year Edmund is confirmed as having 'right of wreck' in Cornwall [...]|$|E
2500|$|When non-trustees {{interfere}} with the workings of an express trust {{to such an extent}} as to harm it, they can be deemed to be [...] "constructive trustees", or trustees de son tort. In Mara v Browne, Smith LJ stated that [...] "if one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to <b>intermeddle</b> with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee, he may therefore make himself what is called in law trustee of his own wrong - ie, a trustee de son tort, or, as it is also termed, a constructive trustee". For someone to be made a constructive trustee, they must have had the property in their possession or control before the application, and have acted in a dishonest or reckless way. If found liable, the constructive trust will be held to account personally to repay any loss suffered by the trust fund, and will be responsible for maintaining that trust property in his possession.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{types of}} {{constructive}} trust not relating to unconscionable dealings are constructive trusts over property, mutual wills, and arguably secret trusts. Where property is sold or transferred, {{the signing of}} an agreement to do so automatically transfers the equitable interest to the buyer or transferee; until the property itself is transferred, it is deemed to be held on constructive trust for the recipient. Mutual wills are irrevocable wills made by multiple people to come into force at the writer's death; similarly, these are also considered constructive trusts. Secret trusts {{are the subject of}} much debate over their classification, but one theory holds them to be constructive in nature. Related to constructive trusts are constructive trustees, or trustees de son tort; these are where [...] "one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to <b>intermeddle</b> with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee". Where their actions are reckless or dishonest, the court makes that person a constructive trustee, forcing them to account to the beneficiaries for any loss suffered and look after the trust property in their possession.|$|E
2500|$|In {{clarifying}} {{the meaning of}} intent {{in the context of}} a trespass to chattels claim of Torts states that [...] "intention is present when an act is done for the purpose of using or otherwise <b>intermeddling</b> with a chattel or with knowledge that such an <b>intermeddling</b> will, to a substantial certainty, result from the act," [...] and that, furthermore, [...] "t is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such <b>intermeddling</b> is a violation of the possessory rights of another." ...|$|R
5000|$|Intentionality. The {{interference}} must be intentional. What constitutes intention {{varies by}} jurisdiction, however, the Restatement (Second) of Torts indicates that [...] "intention is present when an act {{is done for}} the purpose of using or otherwise <b>intermeddling</b> with a chattel or with knowledge that such an <b>intermeddling</b> will, to a substantial certainty, result from the act", and continues: [...] "it is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such <b>intermeddling</b> is a violation of the possessory rights of another".|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} history of the equitable liability for assisting in a breach of trust and the current requirement that the <b>intermeddling</b> stranger must be dishonest. The position in equity is compared with the position in the criminal law and the common law and the dissertation will consider if ‘dishonesty’ is a state of mind or conduct and if it is appropriate to require the <b>intermeddling</b> stranger to be dishonest. The aim is to establish if liability in equity should be founded on the dishonesty or knowledge of an <b>intermeddling</b> stranger and to consider if the appropriate test is currently being applied...|$|R

2500|$|In sum, {{the basic}} {{elements}} of a claim of trespass to chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent to the trespass, 2) interference or <b>intermeddling</b> with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions.
