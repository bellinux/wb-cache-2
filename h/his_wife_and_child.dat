5|$|After the United Kingdom's {{entry into}} World War I in 1914, Wheeler {{volunteered for the}} armed forces.

It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by choice or not. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 1905, he {{was married}} to a divorcee, Frances Jane Wyatt, in London. In 1908, he was brought before the courts in {{bankruptcy}} proceedings, owing some ₤5,500. During the hearing he stated that he had been at sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year looking for work. He and his wife had one daughter. He was enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in September 1910, having lowered his age and given Auckland as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> at their Park Lane home in London and travelling to Sydney, Australia.

5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Wheeler {{moved into a}} top-floor flat near Gordon Square with <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex. In doing so, he produced his first publication, an academic paper on Colchester's Roman Balkerne Gate {{which was published in}} the Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society in 1920. He soon followed this with two papers in the Journal of Roman Studies; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city's Temple of Claudius which was destroyed by Boudica's revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain. He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his Doctorate of Letters; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler. He was unsatisfied with his job in the Commission, unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, and so began to seek out alternative employment.|$|E

25|$|The SS {{entered the}} camp on two {{occasions}} to commit atrocities, before finally liquidating most of the Jewish laborers in July 1944, shortly before the German retreat out of Vilnius. In November 1943, a Jewish prisoner named David Zalkind, <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> attempted {{to escape from the}} camp and were caught by the Gestapo. They were publicly executed in the camp courtyard {{in front of the other}} prisoners. On March 27, 1944, while Plagge was away on home leave in Germany, the SS carried out a Kinder Aktion ("Children Operation"). They entered the camp, rounded up the vast majority of the camp’s 250 children and then transported them away from the camp to be killed, most likely at the killing grounds of Paneriai. Thus both Plagge and his subordinates, as well as the prisoners, understood that ultimately the SS would decide the fate of the camp’s Jews.|$|E
