40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a 'postmodern' {{alternative to}} business ethics {{in the light}} of two authors: Zygmunt Bauman and Michel Foucault. Despite their <b>different</b> <b>usage</b> of the <b>concepts</b> 'ethics' and 'morality', both offer an approach to ethics that avoids the problems of a self-enclosed subject inherent in liberal as well as in communal theories. Bauman and Foucault demonstrate how the continuation of social dialogue suffers from the postulation of fixed individual and organizational identities. Managers and other participants cannot formulate ethical rules on their own, but neither can they come together as a community without tensions and difference. Instead, embodied engagement in the reciprocal play of interpretations and influences keeps us ethically attuned to the limits of reason. ...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{complementarity}} is {{of considerable}} use {{in studies of}} institutions, because {{if it can be}} correctly applied, it enables analysts to consider when and how certain institutions ‘belong’ together to form a Gestalt or overall shape, or, in contrast, to indicate when two or more institutions might be incompatible with each other. If it is possible to reach conclusions of this kind, not only is institutional analysis placed on a scientific basis, but it can also acquire relevance to policymakers and other institution builders. This article distinguishes between three <b>different</b> <b>usages</b> of the <b>concept</b> {{to be found in the}} literature, and analyses that literature as it falls within these <b>different</b> <b>usages.</b> The overall tendency of the argument is to advise caution in the use of complementarity in institutional research, though the concept is not rejected, as a distinct role will be found for it...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{information}} systems (IS) publications reveal an emerging interest in studying postadoptive system use behaviors. Compared to the well-established research stream of IS adoption and initial usage, understanding of IS use behaviors after initial implementation stage {{is still at}} its early stage. To further develop knowledge about this phenomenon, this study reviews the IS implementation stage model {{and a variety of}} post-adoptive <b>usage</b> <b>concepts</b> in extant literature. These <b>usage</b> <b>concepts</b> are classified into three types and are mapped against their corresponding implementation stages. A two dimensional view of these use concepts is then proposed as an alternative perspective to understand these post-adoptive behaviors. Implications are also discussed {{at the end of this}} paper.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is twofold. On the one hand, I will outline the diverse <b>usages</b> that the <b>concept</b> of history has taken on {{throughout}} Western history. These <b>different</b> <b>usages</b> may be grouped together in three semantic fields (history as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as a way of doing), which correspond to three ways of understanding the Philosophy of History: as Epistemology of History, as Ontology of historicity and as ethical-political Critique of the present. On the other hand, I will show that these three concepts of history (and, accordingly, the three ways of understanding the Philosophy of History) refer mutually to each other and, thus, are inseparable from each other...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the usage of Japanese {{particles}} "wa" and "ga" based on speaker's attitude of mind. To consider the education of Japanese for foreigners, hypotheses were built up pragmatically; a speaker used "wa" to lay emphasis on the following part of a sentence which particles divide, and "ga" to emphasize the preceding phrase. It was opposed to given-new information hypothesis. The first study investigated the <b>different</b> <b>usages</b> of "wa" and "ga" on the first sentences appearing in newspapers. The results showed that "wa" was much used in economic pages as "ga" was rather used in social ones. It suggested that the <b>different</b> <b>usages</b> of "wa" and "ga" were related to a writer's different attitude of mind. The second study investigated <b>different</b> <b>usages</b> by undergraduates when asked to select appropriate particles in given sentences and to write their reasons why they selected them. It suggested that the selection of the particles depended on how to lay emphasis rather than on given-new information...|$|R
