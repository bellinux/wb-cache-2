40|$|The {{increased}} {{noise level}} as trains travel over bridges is, in many situations, {{a source of}} disturbance for nearby residents. As well as the rolling noise radiated by the wheel and track, the vibration generated at the wheel-rail interface also propagates into the bridge structure and the vibration response {{of the components of}} the bridge is an important extra source of noise compared with tracks at-grade. Vibration isolation of the bridge structure from the rail is therefore used to reduce noise. This often takes the form of resilient <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Two different <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> fastenings were therefore tested on a twin track bridge by the Swiss Railways (SBB). The bridge over the river Emme at Burgdorf, is a ballastless steel bridge with timbers between the <b>rail</b> <b>fastener</b> and the bridge. Hanging steel sleepers have been added between the wooden sleepers on which the track is supported to form a continuous deck under the track. To find the best elasticity for the <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners,</b> predictions of the bridge noise were made using the Norbert model. Measurements were made on the bridge with the track in its original state to provide parameters for the model. These included rail and sleeper vibration as well as pass-by noise from service passenger and freight trains at different speeds. For the two tracks, <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners</b> from two suppliers were installed. The measurement after installation showed a clear noise reduction for the frequency range from 80 to 400 Hz of about 10 dB.

40|$|Purpose. Calculation of {{a railway}} track on the {{strength}} {{is one of the}} sections of the overall complex research problems of interaction track and rolling stock. This paper describes the experimental study of horizontal transverse stiffness of railway rails with various strands of <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Materials of this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity of rail yarns with different designs of <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners</b> was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement of rails calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load of rails was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections.

A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces. These can both be considered second-order effects and were minimized in the floating bridge application by limiting {{the height of the}} components of the system. This was achieved by using a thin wing girder along the bearing yoke surface that was stiffened by an edge beam and coping the ends of the bearer bars where they connected to the friction pendulum bearings.|$|R
30|$|According to a model {{proposed}} by Remington and Witting [46], {{the generation of}} bridge-borne noise {{can be divided into}} three steps: first, as the train passes, the wheel–rail interaction causes the rail and wheel to vibrate; second, the vibratory energy is then transmitted to the bridge structure through the rail fastening, causing various structural components of the bridge to vibrate; and third, the vibrating bridge components, rails, and wheels then radiate sound. This model used the combined wheel–rail roughness as the external excitation. Once the total power input of the bridge was calculated, the distribution of power throughout the bridge structure was determined using simple SEA. Finally, the total sound power radiated by the bridge was calculated using the radiation efficiency of each component. Because this model only accounted for the rail’s vertical bending and traveling wave, no wave transmission in the rail was modeled at frequencies below the decoupling one, which is not reasonable. Remington and Witting then compared the noise radiated by an open-deck viaduct with and without rail fastenings; the measured noise levels were compared with the ones computed by the above model. According to the theoretical calculation, the noise level would be reduced by 2  dB(A) after installing <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> fastenings; the actual reduction was 4  dB(A), indicating that the computed results were reasonable. The theoretical model was used further to investigate the effectiveness of several noise reduction measures, and <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> fastenings were shown to be the most effective (maximum noise reduction: 10  dB(A)).|$|R

"May 2012 "When a moving load is applied on an <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> with an <b>elastic</b> insulator, wave propagation can occur and become problematic after certain characteristic speeds are reached. Research of these waveforms and characteristic speeds is specifically applicable for understanding electromagnetic railgun dynamics. There are three characteristic speeds for an <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> on an <b>elastic</b> foundation: critical, shear, and bar speeds - critical speed being the slowest and the first speed reached by the armature, followed by shear and bar speeds respectively. Studying these speeds and the deformations associated with them is essential in understanding the dynamics and damage effects of rail-armature interaction. One dimensional analysis of a quasi-stationary load moving along an infinite beam on an elastic foundation reveals different waveforms between these characteristic speeds. Furthermore, two-dimensional finite element analyses of rail cross-sectional planes reveal the geometrical mode shapes and their longitudinal wave propagation within the rail. Under different excitation frequencies the magnitudes and propagation speeds of these modes change. With an elastic foundation we show that some of these modes have cut-on speeds, which result in different critical velocities in the rail-armature system. Moreover, the relationship between the critical speeds and different size, geometrical, thermal, and insulator properties are examined. Understanding the waveforms and mode shapes of a typical rail foundation is the goal of this research. With a firm understanding of the dynamics and accurate modeling, various computational scenarios are investigated to find a feasible solution that can reduce the damaging interaction between the armature and rails...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Despite {{the steady}} {{increase}} in the length of sections of continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, wooden railway sleepers, {{as one of the}} options of under-rail bearings, are still operated on a sufficiently large number of areas, in particular, remain uncontested in the curve of up to 350 m radius, {{as well as on the}} main ways of subways. The main types of fasteners in the most common types of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers are track screws and spikes. Since the «wheel-rail» system contact peculiarities existing in track curved sections have a significant impact on the processes of interaction between the railway track and rolling stock, it is necessary in this work to determine the rigidity of the track screws and spikes, which are directly involved in the formation of spatial rigidity of the intermediate rail fastening nodes under the influence of horizontal transverse forces. Methodology. The study of the track screw and spike rigidity was conducted experimentally for the two types of intermediate rail fastenings – D 0 and «Metro». To carry out experimental tests, 10 test sites were selected on the roads of the regional branch of «Southern Railway» of «Ukrzaliznytsia», and 8 – in the main routes of KP «Kharkiv Metro». Each of the test sites was in approximately the same operating conditions, but had different values of passed tonnage. Findings. The values of the track screw and spike rigidity were obtained. Originality. The authors first obtained the experimental data on variation in rigidity of track screw and spike, depending on the useful life for the main railways and subway routes. This allows calculation of the horizontal shear forces in track curved sections (particularly in curves of up to 350 m radius), as well as the forecast evaluation of their level change during operation. Practical value. Based on the experimental data, it was found that variation in rigidity of track screw and spike depending on the lifetime is nonlinear.

The applied method employs the energy state variables as time functions leading to determine the susceptibility of a given contact on the strength induced by the rail roll...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of the beam adapted for use in general-purpose software systems to analyze dynamic characteristics. The elastic properties of the beam tension, bending and torsion are taken into account. Such a model significantly expands the functional capabilities of the complexes. The mathematical model of the beam designed for the finite element method is taken as a basis. Then its adaptation is carried out {{taking into account the}} beam joint to the arbitrary points of a rigid solid, thereby having a model suitable to analyze objects with lumped parameters. Beam parameters are the material parameters, the geometric characteristics, and the coordinates of joint points to the solids. The paper describes in detail the algorithm of computations performed at each step of numerical integration of the systems of ordinary differential equations, and presents an equivalent diagram of the mathematical model of the beam. Mathematical models of <b>elastic</b> <b>rail</b> guides, cylindrical and prismatic, derived from the mathematical model of the beam are more functional compared to the models based on the kinematic equations. The prismatic rail guide (V-guide), unlike the beam, does not counteract the translational motion of solids along it, i. e. only works in torsion and bending, and a deforming part of the rail guide length is variable. The cylindrical rail guide works in bending only. These differences can be easily implemented by modifying the equations of the mathematical model of the beam. Using these models allows us to connect solids by two or more rail guides, and it does not lead to the degeneration of the Jacobi matrix (unlike models based on kinematic equations). The models are implemented in PA 8 and PA 9 software and methodological support complexes for analysis of dynamic objects developed at the Department of CAD in Bauman MSTU. </p...|$|R
