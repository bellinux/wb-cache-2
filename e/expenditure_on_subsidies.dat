30|$|In this paper, {{we set out}} to {{determine}} the impact of extension-personnel-to-farmer ratios and government expenditure on input subsidies in empirically predicting adoption of minimum tillage combined with mulching (MTM), controlling for household demographic, plot and market variables. From the probit results and subsequent simulations, we find that the likelihood of MTM adoption can be enhanced by a programme that supports farmers in acquiring inputs more cheaply (e.g. subsidies) and by increasing the extension-staff-to-farmer ratio. Generally, the results showed that both subsidy and extension can influence the probability of MTM adoption. When the extension-personnel-to-farmer ratios were compared to public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>subsidies,</b> the effect of the subsidy variable appears to have had the stronger effect on MTM adoption. When <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>subsidies</b> as a percentage of total agricultural budgets was reduced, and extension-to-farmer ratio was increased, the probability of adoption fell. Granted, these results may be contingent on the ranges of simulation values used in this study and are tentative to this extent. For example, our data do not provide evidence on the quality or content of extension services. The simulation results as well as those from the regressions analysis nevertheless point {{to the conclusion that the}} challenges of MTM adoption and diffusion are similar to (if not the same as) those that face other agricultural technologies in general. These include resource availability, market access and social capital.|$|E

We estimate that each $ 1 of government <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>subsidies</b> increases total saving by only 1 cent. In contrast, policies that raise retirement con-tributions if individuals take no action – such as automatic employer contributions to retirement accounts – increase wealth accumulation substantially.

A general equilibrium model developed for the Sri Lankan economy using the input-output table for 2000 was used for the analysis. The model consists of 5 sectors, 2 factors of production and households in 8 representative provinces. The key results of the analysis indicate that removal of the import tariff on rice along with removals of the import tariff <b>on</b> fertilizer and/or <b>subsidy</b> payments <b>on</b> other agricultural sectors could improve economic efficiency and household welfare across provinces. Contrary to the general belief that protectionism is pro-poor, an import ban on rice reduces household income and welfare even in agricultural provinces, including Uva and Sabaragamuwa.

We revisit this classic question using 45 million observations on savings {{for the population}} of Denmark.

Tax subsidies, which rely upon individuals to take an action to raise savings, have small impacts on total wealth.

In contrast, policies that raise savings automatically even if individuals take no action – such as employer-provided pensions or automatic contribu-tions to retirement accounts – increase wealth accumulation substantially.

We estimate that 85 % of individ-uals are passive savers. The 15 % of active savers who respond to price subsidies do so primarily by shifting assets across accounts rather than reducing consumption.

We ascertain the stationarity properties for all the series, separately using the ADF test, the DF-GLS test and the KPSS test. We estimate the long-run and short-run coefficients and find that a long-run negative relationship exists between Gini coefficient and subsidy-related expenditure. The long-run coefficients of direct and indirect taxation terms are positive but are significant only at 10 %. The short-run coefficients obtained from ECM show that a negative relationship exists between <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>subsidies</b> and Gini coefficient. In short run, direct tax seems to have an insignificant positive coefficient while indirect tax seems to have a significant unbalancing effect. We employ the Granger causality tests to confirm direction of causality and find that there runs a unidirectional causality from direct tax, indirect tax and subsidy to Gini coefficient, while any causality from Gini to any series is largely insignificant. The results imply that the government should use the calculated hybrid of tools like direct and indirect taxation and subsidies to have an equalizing impact on the economy. Moreover, the significant causal relationship from subsidies to Gini opens up an opportunity for the government to improve the income distribution using targeted subsidies, for example the Aadhaar-linked Direct Transfer Benefits etc...|$|E

40|$|There {{is still}} some {{ambiguity}} about what is sustainable development. From an economic point of view it involves maintaining a stock of assets for posterity that is {{equal to or greater}} than the stock of assets of the current generation. This is the basis of the capital approach to sustainable development. To measure how sustainable an economy is, based on the capital basis of sustainable development, multilateral institutions such as the World Bank use wealth accounting combined with the genuine savings approach to measure how well economies are saving for the future, net of current asset depreciation. These measures are useful for telling policy makers how their policies are contributing to sustainability and whether their economies are on a sustainable development path. Although these measures tell which assets are being depleted and the level of savings required, they do not tell why inadequate savings or inadequate investments might be occurring and how these assets are distributed among income groups within the economy. These measures are also not linked explicitly with the development prospects of the country and the needs of the current generation. This thesis attempts to assess if distributional outcomes affect how much countries save and therefore whether this has any impact on sustainability. To examine the impact of distribution on sustainability, a case study of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) is conducted. T&T has had a negative genuine savings rate {{for most of the last}} two decades, primarily due to the excessive exploitation of its natural resources (oil and natural gas) without sufficient savings or reinvestment of the revenues from these resources. Has the distribution of these resource rents had any impact on saving outcomes? An attempt is made to answer these questions by assessing how government expenditure is distributed and who benefits most from the exploitation of the natural resources. The analyses contained within the thesis show that <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> energy <b>subsidies,</b> the distribution of human capital and the overall distributions of rents are all regressively distributed...|$|R

Over {{the last three decades}} rural places worldwide have arguably been transformed by the market processes and commodification of nature that are widely seen as trademarks of neoliberalisation. Longer term socio-demographic trends have been exacerbated by a combination of globalisation and neoliberal economic policies that have profoundly restructured "the material, social and economic conditions of life in rural areas"(Cocklin et al., 2002, p. 2). The forms that this restructuring takes are varied, but include the withdrawal of or cuts in <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> services, reduced <b>subsidies</b> to agriculture, the liberalisation of international trade, and a shift to policies encouraging efficiency, self-reliance and competitiveness. Yet, while the social, economic and environmental impacts of neoliberalisation on rural communities and the farming sector are well documented (e. g., Cheshire, 2006, Coleman et al., 2004, Jaffe, 2006, McMichael, 2012, Nousiainen and Pylkkänen, 2013 and Wolf and Bonanno, 2014), there has been little systematic attempt to investigate the interplay between neoliberal principles and policies and the governing of rural environments.

Thesis also aims to asses future (post-crissis) development of the <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> state labour market policy. The theoretical part of this work examines state employment policy and its division into ALMP and PLMP, focusing on Czech Republic and ALMP tools. The practical part of this thesis analyses both absolute and relative terms <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> ALMP and PLMP between 1993 and 2014 and puts them into relation with unemployment and GDP, with government objectives and other important facts (EU entry). The total amouth of <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> state labour parket policies has been rising since 1993. The proportion of <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> ALMP and PLMP was going through significant changes and the role of ALMP increases in time. Nevertheless, the average value of <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> PLMP for the entire period is almost twice the average <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> ALMP...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{distinguishes between}} two {{components}} of government consumption, <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> final goods and <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> hours, and compares {{the effects of}} changes in these two on the current account. I find that changes in government <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> hours do not directly affect the current account and that their impact is considerably smaller than the impact produced by changes in government <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> final goods. These findings indicate that considering government consumption as entirely <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> final goods leads to overestimating its role in accounting for movements in the current account balance.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate the relationships between different factors affecting educational competitiveness, which is crucial to enhancing national competitiveness in every country, and to put forward policy implications whereby each country may raise the level of its educational competitiveness. PISA score was selected as an indicator representing the educational competitiveness of 22 OECD countries, and this included some independent variables, such as per capita GDP, total public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, and total per capita public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education (US dollars), affecting educational competitiveness. We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness. The research results show that there are three significant combinations of variables affecting educational competitiveness (PISA score). Model 1 is a configuration of four variables (high total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, high total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education to GDP, and high GDP), and includes Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Ireland. Model 2 is a configuration of five variables (low total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low ration of students to teaching staff, low private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, and low GDP, and includes Poland. Model 3 is a configuration of five variables (low total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of students to teaching staff, and high GDP), and includes Japan. Finally, the study suggests that each country should endeavour to enhance its own educational competitiveness, considering how the factors associated with this relate to each other...|$|R
