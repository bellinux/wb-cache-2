25|$|Corvid {{ingenuity}} {{is represented}} through their feeding skills, memorization abilities, use of tools, and <b>group</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Living in large social groups {{has long been}} connected with high cognitive ability. To live in a large group, a member {{must be able to}} recognize individuals and track the social position and foraging of other members over time. Members must also be able to distinguish between sex, age, reproductive status, and dominance, and to update this information constantly. It might be that social complexity corresponds to their high cognition.|$|E
500|$|Sociological social {{psychology}} focuses on micro-scale social actions. This area may {{be described as}} adhering to [...] "sociological miniaturism", examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups. Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts {{in terms of human}} social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, group dynamics, prejudice, aggression, social perception, <b>group</b> <b>behaviour,</b> social change, non-verbal behaviour, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with psychological emphasis. In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the experimental method (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction.|$|E

40|$|Nonapeptides are {{important}} regulators of social behaviour across vertebrate taxa. While {{their role in}} simple <b>grouping</b> <b>behaviour</b> has been explored in estrildid finches, other taxa are understudied, prompting us to investigate nonapeptide influences on shoaling behaviour in zebrafish. Subjects received injections of isotocin, an isotocin antagonist, vasotocin, a vasotocin antagonist, or saline, followed by a test of <b>grouping</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Vasotocin decreased social interaction with the shoal. Unexpectedly, the vasotocin antagonist also reduced social interaction with the shoal, as well as general shoaling behaviour. Isotocin and its antagonist had minimal effects on <b>grouping</b> <b>behaviours.</b> These results suggest social interaction and shoaling are discrete aspects of sociality differentially influenced by vasotocin, although we cannot discount possible anxiogenic effects of vasotocin. Contrasting these results with studies in other systems demonstrates that each nonapeptide’s role in social behaviour varies across taxa, and cautions against a simplistic characterisation of nonapeptides as prosocial regulators of behaviour...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the creation of}} groups of characters which, through the use simple actions, cooperate and coordinate to survive together. These groups are created automatically using Evolutionary Computation methods. A Common Pool Resource dilemma is chosen from the social science and economic literature which models a group 2 ̆ 7 s use of a shared resource. Previous studies of human behaviours with this game environment allow for the comparison of the automatically generated solutions against expected behaviours and human performance. It is shown that by introducing irrationality into the solution creation, human-like play can be generated automatically. The traditional dilemmas are expanded by introducing notions of spatiality {{and the notion of}} character roles. This provides several benefits including modelling a familiar convention within computer games as well as providing context based constraints for the evolutionary process. The <b>group</b> <b>behaviours</b> being created must now involve cooperation and coordination, as individuals within the group try to survive in the abstract game world. A range of parameters and their effects are shown on the creation of <b>group</b> <b>behaviours</b> in this abstract game environment. A selection of parameters is chosen to illustrate the behaviours possible under various conditions. Simulated dynamic elements, derived from likely interactions or experiences an AI character may encounter in a computer game, are introduced. A simulated computer game environment is created to assess the performance of <b>group</b> <b>behaviours</b> created in an abstract world. By using various selection criteria, it is shown that solutions automatically created in an abstract environment can, without much modification or translation, be suitable for a computer game environment. It is also shown that, by using an appropriate environment, the application of simple individual actions can lead to <b>group</b> <b>behaviours</b> that exhibit both cooperation and coordination in order to survive in a changing world...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grouping</b> <b>behaviours</b> (e. g. schooling, {{shoaling}} and swarming) {{are commonly}} explicated through adaptive hypotheses such as protection against predation, access to mates or improved foraging. However, {{the hypothesis that}} aggregation can result from manipulation by parasites to increase their transmission has never been demonstrated. We investigated this hypothesis using natural populations of two crustacean hosts (Artemia franciscana and Artemia parthenogenetica) infected with one cestode and two microsporidian par- asites. We found that swarming propensity increased in cestode-infected hosts and that red colour intensity was higher in swarming compared with non-swarming infected hosts. These effects likely result in increased cestode transmission to its final avian host. Furthermore, we found that microsporidian-infected hosts had both increased swarming propensity and surfacing behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated using experimental infections that these concurrent manipulations result in increased spore transmission to new hosts. Hence, {{this study suggests that}} parasites can play a prominent role in host <b>grouping</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|We {{currently}} report {{three studies}} investigating group members' expressions of dissatisfaction and discontent with the behaviour {{and attitudes of}} their in-group members. Our analysis examines {{the context in which}} group members will deviate from actual <b>group</b> member <b>behaviour.</b> We argue that highly identifying group members will challenge fellow <b>group</b> member <b>behaviour</b> when that <b>group</b> member <b>behaviour</b> is perceived to violate injunctive group norms. Further, we predicted that high identifiers would still challenge such <b>group</b> member <b>behaviour</b> even if that behaviour were conducted by a majority of group members. Thus, high identifiers were predicted to express descriptively deviant opinions when the behaviour of other members contravenes injunctive group norms. In Studies 1 and 2, group-level self-definition served as a moderator in the relationship between the expression of discontent and perceived injunctive norm violation; in Study 3, group-level self-investment served as this moderator. The findings supported our predictions. This support was particularly strong when a majority of group members violated group norms. Implications for the analysis of the relationship between social identification and deviance are discussed. 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that African savanna elephants Loxodonta africana produce 31 different call types (Langbauer 2000). Various researchers have described these calls by associating them with specific behavioural contexts. More recently Leong et al. (2003) have attempted to classify elephant call types based on their physical properties. They classified 8 acoustically distinct call types from a population of captive elephants. This study focuses on one of these call types, the rumble, in a wild population of elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa. A single family group of elephants was followed to record <b>group</b> <b>behaviours</b> and vocalizations from January through August 2001. By measuring the physical properties of 663 rumbles and subjecting these to cluster analysis, we present evidence that shows that rumbles can be categorized by their physical properties and that the resulting rumble types are associated with specific <b>group</b> <b>behaviours.</b> We characterize three types of rumbles that differ significantly by ten acoustic parameters. Two rumble types were associated with the elephant group feeding and resting, while the third was associated with socializing and agitation...|$|R

40|$|G regariousness is {{a common}} {{behavioural}} trait observed in many large mammalian herbivores.
