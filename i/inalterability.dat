40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} geminate consonant phenomena known as integrity and <b>inalterability</b> {{with an eye}} toward providing a general characterization of geminate behavior as well as a deeper understanding of geminates in a principled and systematic way under the Optimality Theoretic framework. The fundamental proposal made in this dissertation is to have the range of surface geminate patterns follow from varying the ranking of key constraints. Depending on the ranking of the key constraints, languages select different output forms from the same input form. Thus, the key constraints not only conspire to produce anti-integrity/anti-inalterability effects, but they also determine what a language does "do" with its input geminates (i. e. integrity/inalterability), giving rise to different resolutions to the geminate puzzle. A chapter is devoted to an indepth discussion of integrity effects in geminates. For this purpose, seven key constraints are proposed: MAX-IO, DEP-IO, ONS, PROSHIER, ALIGN(WD-R, M-R), PLONS, NOBREAKING. By varying the key constraints, we can make several predictions about the possible geminate patterns according to the positions in which they occur. Several patterns are exemplified in this dissertation. We have also provided a discussion of the gaps between what is predicted to exist and what cases are attested. Another chapter is devoted to a more detailed analysis of <b>inalterability</b> effects in geminates. In particular, it is claimed that geminate <b>inalterability</b> matters only when we deal with weakening processes (e. g. spirantization, sonorantization, etc.). It is also proposed that the constraints IDENT-IO(μSF) and NOBREAKING play a pivotal role in explaining typological differences between weakening and assimilation, and other types of inalterability/anti-inalterability concerning geminates. The most interesting part of this dissertation is that we can explain both integrity/inalterability and anti-integrity/anti-inalterability cases uniformly depending on the ranking of the key constraints, without assuming any ad hoc conditions or procedures. Thus, those anti-integrity and anti-inalterability effects are produced as a natural consequence of the interaction of the constraints, just as in the cases of integrity and <b>inalterability.</b> Finally, unlike previous rule-based approaches, our theory allows for a unified account of integrity and <b>inalterability</b> through the interaction of a set of key constraints, making predictions available about both phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Indian grammarians knew of {{linguistic}} variation: in Pāṇini's Aṣṭhādyāyī we already find rules to describe Vedic usages, marginal and preferred usages, even regionally restricted usages. Still, this awareness conflicts with a likewise deeply rooted {{belief in the}} intrinsic <b>inalterability</b> of language that Dehspande calls the "theology of Eternal Sanskrit". This leads, as far as Pāṇini is concerned, to a description of Sanskrit language as a panchronistic flatland, i. e. as a totality which includes "all known diachronic and synchronic facts of Sanskrit" (Deshpande 1985 : 124). Pāṇinian grammar {{is based on a}} common set of rules which represents all the shared facts of Sanskrit, including what we would consider Vedic facts, {{as long as they are}} not exclusively Vedic. Of course Pāṇini and his commentators distinguish restricted domains inside this totality i. e. they identify rules which apply exclusively in the domain of mantras (mantre), in the domain of the Vedic hymns (chandasi), in the domain of ordinary language and so on. The present paper will focus on the codification of such domains by later commentators and in particular in the (linguistic) domain of śāstra and what it can tell us about tradition as codified by ancient grammarian...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory Phonology 10 Tashlhiyt Berber has {{contrastive}} singleton and lexical geminate consonants in all positions. In addition, it has {{two types}} of phonologically derived geminates: concatenated and assimilated ones. Within CV phonology, geminates, including post-lexical ones, are represented as single melodic units associated to two prosodic positions. This study examines the way these abstract autosegmental representations {{are reflected in the}} phonetic details of speech production. In particular, it investigates two questions: what are the acoustic and articulatory differences between singletons and lexical geminates; and are there any acoustic differences between the three types of geminates. Results show that the primary correlate which distinguishes singletons from geminates is duration, even for voiceless stops after pause. This primary correlate is enhanced by additional correlates which are crucial to perception of absolute initial and final geminates. The comparison between the three types of geminates shows that they all display the same temporal values which supports the assignment of the same timing representation to these three types of geminates. However, while assimilated geminates, like underlying ones, are enhanced by additional acoustic attributes, concatenated geminates are not. Implications of these results for the general issue of geminate behaviour are discussed, with particular interest on geminate Ambiguity and geminate <b>Inalterability...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis talk {{deals with}} the phonetic {{implementation}} and the phonological representation {{of different types of}} geminate consonants in Tashlhiyt Berber (Morocco). It continues a rich history of research on the structure and phonetic implementation of geminate consonants, including the acoustic and perceptual cues to gemination (Abramson 1986, Lahiri and Hankamer 1988), the phonetics and phonology of gemination resulting from assimilation (Ohala 1990), the articulatory gestures differentiating singleton and geminate consonants (Smith 1995), and the acoustic correlates of lexical and derived geminates (Ladd and Scobbie 2003). Tashlhiyt Berber is an excellent test case to deal with these issues since, most unusually, it has contrastive lexical geminates initially and finally as well as medially, and presents two types of phonologically derived geminates: concatenated and assimilated ones. We first examine the acoustic, articulatory and perceptual correlates of gemination within monomorphemic lexical items. The acoustic study examines the effect of gemination on various temporal and non-temporal parameters for voiced and voiceless obstruents in different prosodic positions. The articulatory and perceptual studies deal with the specific case of utterance-initial singleton and geminate voiceless stops (e. g. [ks] 'feed on' vs. [kks] 'take off'), and examines whether the length contrast is encoded articulatorily (based on electropalatographic data) and whether listeners perceive the distinction for these voiceless stops in this position. We further consider how lexical geminates differ from concatenated and assimilated geminates based on acoustic data. Implications of the results for the general issue of geminate representation and geminate behavior will be discussed, with particular attention to ambiguity and <b>inalterability</b> effects...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} a {{range of}} phenomena in the phonology of Modern Irish, in particular the initial consonant mutations, distinctive palatalization and epenthesis and compensatory lengthening. A convergence of evidence from these different domains argues for the theoretical frameworks adopted, in particular those of Feature Geometry Theory and Moraic Theory. The articulated structures of Feature Geometry Theory allow for a more principled account of the initial consonant mutations than is possible within other theories. The epenthesis and lengthening processes may be accounted for only within a prosodic theory based on syllable weight. Issues bearing on Underspecification Theory are also addressed. ^ In Chapter 2, the initial consonant mutations that express morphological distinctions in Irish are discussed. The following claims are argued for: First, these mutations {{are the result of}} rules, rather than morphological affixation. Second, these rules are blocked by linked heteromorphemic structure, however, this <b>Inalterability</b> effect cannot be captured by current proposals in the literature. Rather, a more general condition on structural conditions on rule application is proposed. Third, vowel stems in Irish are argued to have underspecified onsets. The range of prothetic consonants that occur preceding vowel-initial stems in certain morphological environments is shown to be the surface realizations of these onsets. ^ Chapter 3 focusses on the Place features and palatalization. It is argued, on the basis of evidence involving the initial consonant mutations and assimilation, that the primary and secondary place features must be represented independently. Of further interest are data involving consonant-vowel interaction which argue for context-sensitive Radical Underspecification, whereby lexical and default feature values are relativized to the categories for which they are defined. ^ In Chapter 4 a unified prosodic account is given of a number of epenthesis and vowel-lengthening processes in Irish. The epenthesis process discussed is not conditioned in an obvious syllabic way, nor is the vowel-lengthening a typical case of compensatory lengthening following deletion of segmental material. Rather, both processes are the result of the transfer, and thereby the preservation, of prosodic weight within the syllable. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{church of}} Santa Maria Annunciata at San Carlo Borromeo Hospital in Milan {{is a prime}} example of {{contemporary}} architecture. The church was built between 1964 and 1967 by Gio Ponti (1891 - 1979), one of the main protagonists of XX Century Italian architecture. The unconventional choice of materials and shapes is the result of the architect's specific intent so their preservation is an important task in the conservation planning. The restoration project, through a careful analysis of the exterior facades degradation, highlighted a complex situation connected to contemporary art. The processes of surface alteration, synergistically caused by exposure to weathering, compositional aspects, constructive and material characteristics, show phenomena that cannot be found in historical buildings [1]. Particular attention was devoted to the external ceramic facing, made of glazed porcelain stoneware (or grès) tiles. The critical conservation status of the ceramic elements required an intervention for the consolidation of diffuse micro-cracking in the glassy coating and the protection of the still intact material. Silica thin films synthesized by sol-gel process, according to the technology developed by the Chemistry for Cultural Heritage research group (Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova), was used to perform an innovative protective treatment. This method involves a new synthetic path to obtain highly pure glassy silica thin films operating at low temperatures and in a neutral environment. The deposition of films is performed closely to neutral pH conditions, in order to avoid degradation of objects sensitive to acidic or basic environment. The slow drying process carried out at ambient temperature does not require the heat treatments necessary for the traditional sol-gel method and thus avoids possible damages to the substrate [2]. Phenomena involved in weathering, as well as chemical and morphological characteristics of the ceramic materials, were analysed and considered in planning the protective treatment. Compatibility with the glass substrate, stability to solar radiation, chemical corrosion and biological degradation resistance, durability and <b>inalterability</b> of the optical characteristics of the material are all features in accordance with the restoration needs. The encouraging results obtained show that this new technology can be widely used as an effective alternative to traditional methods, often based on the use of synthetic organic polymers...|$|E
40|$|Dendara, July 16, 54 BCE, {{began the}} {{reconstruction}} of the temple dedicated to the goddess Hathor. Founded under Ptolemy XII, the temple studied here stands {{at the end of an}} architectural tradition developed over three millennia. Its state of conservation is exceptional. It is the latest preserved monumental cult building of the pharaonic civilisation. It is a particularly well-suited testimony for an attempt to comprehend the architectural conception of a culture with which no modern society has kept any direct connection. The starting point of this study is a precise survey which constitutes the scientific documentation. The establishment of these data went along with the observation of indications, dimensions, orientations and alterations which allows to identify constant characteristics belonging to the process of designing the structure of the temple. This study uses no technical methodology but rather presents a research of knowledge through observation, hypotheses and verification. There is no pretension to exhaustiveness. This study tries to find, from the territory to the details, breaches, or to give access, into the knowledge belonging to the way of designing. The plans and sections are accompanied by a research which begins with a presentation of the nature of the architectural study of the building belonging to a disappeared culture. Then follows the study of the Egyptian temple and of the technical details of the survey. A building belongs to a territory. The absence of any documentation, the disappearance of vestiges dug out since the end of the 19 th century as well as the actual policy of land reclaiming on the site made a cartography of the whole area of the ancient city necessary as a salvage. This led to some thoughts about the urban shape around the temple and about the limits of the space between the divine and the civil world. The reconstruction of a temenos wall brought with it a large reorganisation and renovation of the city and caused an important tabula rasa of civil districts. A global description of the building precedes the chapter concerning the organisation of the space. The world being set up around the god, it progresses from the most holy place towards the civil environment. The system underlying the height of the different spaces can only be determined when taking the heart of the temple as point of origin. Particular attention was devoted to the means which the ancient builders had at their disposal in order to control the precision of their accomplishment. Although rules concerning the outer measurements of the naos and the inner volume of the cella could be determined, it is impossible to reduce the dimensioning of the Egyptian space to a system of constant proportions. The study of the use of the space confirms this statement as it reveals that the functional elements of doors and windows do not follow any ideal formal rules. They are the result of a topological conception where geometric accuracy sacralises different needs; sometimes trivial when one considers light as a physical agent necessary to the daily functioning of human beings in a structure belonging to the divine. The intelligence and the accuracy of these accomplishments clearly required a global and initial conception of the architectural object. The durability of the building was the ultimate reason for the designers' research of technical quality. No single part of the construction, from the foundations to the top of the cornices, escaped this ancient concern. This led to an evolution towards a monolithic character of the masonry and the integration of solutions to contain factors of degradation, such as the rain. This concern also includes a tradition of a seismic culture as well as an execution which optimises the performance of labour and the materials. In parallel to this evolution on can observe the emergence of an ancient analysis of the phenomenon of differential sinking and the development of details which allow a dynamic management of major sources of destruction. Computer modelling helped to check the pertinence of some of these ultimate systems of management of deformation. From the temple of Hathor at Dendara one can conclude that the competence of building has attained a high degree of complexity and of meaning as far as the production of an architectural form is concerned which had to obey to an ideal of perfection and <b>inalterability.</b> Beyond the secular world, the formal conceptualisation of the divine universe also became an intellectual challenge with various referential levels. The architectural composition went along with an active research of technical solutions in order to optimise the art of building...|$|E
