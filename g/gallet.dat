5|$|In May 1900, Teuruarii journeyed {{with a few}} island dignitaries to Papeete on the {{invitation}} of Gustave <b>Gallet,</b> the French governor, to discuss the possibility of annexing the island. On May 11, Teuruarii signed a statement of annexation, officially bringing Rurutu under French control. Months later, the L'Aube brought <b>Gallet</b> to Rurutu, where he officially took possession of the island. On August 25, in a formal ceremony witnessed by Governor <b>Gallet,</b> the officers of the L'Aube, the French officials aboard, the former king and the native population, {{the flag of the}} protectorate was lowered and the French tricolor raised in its place; this moment, like the ceremony of 1888, was celebrated by a 21-gun salute from the French vessel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Galleting</b> is the {{practice}} of inserting chips of stone into the mortar joints of masonry. Its long and enduring history is not explained by the belief that it is primarily decorative and a convincing purpose is sought. Information is not only in short supply but also inconsistent in the unsubstantiated views expressed. A detailed understanding of <b>galleted</b> masonry is necessary for its correct conservation. To better understand the subject {{a wide range of}} <b>galleted</b> mortar joints were photographed, questionnaires were sent to professionals and their views correlated and a separate convenience survey conducted. The geographical spread of <b>galleting</b> was plotted and the origins of <b>galleting</b> sought through secondary data sources. Finally, a series of new and innovative tests was devised to establish the influence of <b>gallets</b> on the strength and durability of lime mortar joints. A definition and taxonomy was devised to aid positive identification of <b>galleting.</b> Lime mortar joints are susceptible to early failure due to the slow progression of carbonation, exposure to weathering and the build-up of stresses. It was found that the incorporation of <b>gallets</b> into joints resolved this by significantly increasing compressive strength and reducing shrinkage. The <b>gallets,</b> being stronger than the mortar, accommodate the shear stresses and minimise the risk of failure. At the same time, they increase the durability of a wall and reduce damage due to weathering. Results show that <b>galleting</b> has been in use for many centuries, is more widespread than is generally recognised and almost certainly started out as a significant structural element in masonry construction. The true purpose of <b>galleting</b> and its relationship to the mortar in which it is bedded throws new light onto the use of non-hydraulic lime mortar in construction and conservation work. This will help conservationists and operatives to understand the complex nature of this traditional form of building...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} claimed {{that in the}} {{build-up}} to World War I, de Gaulle agreed with Pétain about the obsolescence of cavalry and of traditional tactics {{in the age of}} machine guns and barbed wire, and often debated great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war with his superior. Lacouture is sceptical, pointing out that although Pétain wrote him glowing appraisals in the first two quarters of 1913, it is unlikely that he stood out among the 19 captains and 32 lieutenants under his command. De Gaulle would have been present at the 1913 Arras Maneouvres, at which Pétain criticised General Le <b>Gallet</b> to his face, but there is no evidence in his notebooks that he accepted Pétain’s ideas about the importance of firepower. De Gaulle stressed how French armies of the Napoleonic period had relied on infantry column attack, and how French military might have declined in the nineteenth century because of – supposedly – excessive concentration on firepower. He also appears to have accepted the then fashionable lesson drawn from the recent Russo-Japanese War, of how attacks by infantry with high morale had succeeded in the face of enemy firepower.|$|E
500|$|In 1663 Scottish {{mathematician}} James Gregory {{had suggested}} in his Optica Promota that observations of a transit {{of the planet}} Mercury, at widely spaced points {{on the surface of}} the Earth, could be used to calculate the solar parallax and hence the astronomical unit using triangulation. Aware of this, a young Edmond Halley made observations of such a transit on 28 October O.S. 1677 from Saint Helena but was disappointed to find that only Richard Towneley in Burnley, Lancashire had made another accurate observation of the event whilst <b>Gallet,</b> at Avignon, simply recorded that it had occurred. Halley was not satisfied that the resulting calculation of the solar parallax at 45" [...] was accurate.|$|E

500|$|The premiere, {{originally}} planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th {{because of the}} illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis <b>Gallet,</b> who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as [...] "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..." [...] The audience's appreciation was not reflected {{in the majority of}} the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that [...] "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a [...] "claque" [...] of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.|$|E
500|$|In June 1872, Bizet {{informed}} Galabert: [...] "I {{have just}} been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [...] Meilhac and [...] Halévy are doing my piece". The subject chosen for this project was Prosper Mérimée's short novel, Carmen. Bizet began the music {{in the summer of}} 1873, but the Opéra-Comique's management was concerned about the suitability of this risqué story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment, and work was suspended. Bizet then began composing Don Rodrigue, an adaptation of the El Cid story by Louis <b>Gallet</b> and Édouard Blau. He played a piano version to a select audience that included the Opéra's principal baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure, hoping that the singer's approval might influence the directors of the Opéra to stage the work. However, on the night of 28–29 October, the Opéra burned to the ground; the directors, amid other pressing concerns, set Don Rodrigue aside. It was never completed; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture, Patrie.|$|E

50|$|In his {{libretto}} for Massenet's Thaïs he employed an unrhymed {{free verse}} that he termed, in Parnassien fashion, poésie melique which, like its classical Greek predecessors, {{was designed for}} a declamation with accompaniment (melodrama). In <b>Gallet's</b> hands declamation rose by degrees into a freely-structured aria that was raised above the level of prose by its sonorities and syntactical patterns, formulas that were finely suited to the musical techniques of both Saint-Saëns and Massenet. After <b>Gallet's</b> death, Saint-Saëns wrote:I wish I knew what {{to say about the}} man himself, his unwearying goodness, his loyalty, his scrupulousness, his good humor, his originality, his continual common sense, and his intellect, alert to everything unusual and interesting.|$|R
