500|$|Throughout his career, Bacon {{consciously}} {{and carefully}} avoided explaining the meaning behind his paintings, and pointedly observed {{that they were}} not intended as narratives, nor open to interpretation. When Bragg challenged him with the observation that Triptych, May–June 1973 was the nearest the artist had come to telling a story, Bacon admitted that [...] "it is in fact the nearest I've ever done to a story, because you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the triptych of how [...] was found". He {{went on to say that}} the work reflected not just his reaction to Dyer's death, but his general feelings about the fact that his friends were then dying around him [...] "like flies". A borderline alcoholic himself, Bacon continued to explain that his dead friends were [...] "generally heavy drinkers", and that their deaths led directly to his composition of a series of meditative self-portraits which emphasised his own aging and awareness of the passage of time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact <b>that</b> you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>was</b> and is eternally all-powerful and <b>that</b> impotence <b>is</b> not possible for Him. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>is</b> omniscient of the past and present and <b>that</b> ignorance <b>is</b> not possible for Him. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>knows</b> everything <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> everything <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> and how things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not would be if they <b>were.</b> And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>is</b> eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and that He does not have need of sense organs. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>is</b> eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>is</b> not like physical bodies, and <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>is</b> not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He <b>is</b> One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than He is contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if you <b>know</b> all of <b>that</b> you <b>know</b> the oneness of God.|$|R
