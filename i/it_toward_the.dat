5|$|Homer and Burns are {{beset by}} cabin fever {{and attempt to}} kill each other. After a vicious struggle, Burns ignites the cabin's propane tank, {{launching}} the building out of the snow and propelling <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> horrified onlookers. Once {{it comes to a}} halt, Burns reminds everyone of the contest, and all the workers hurry inside. Lenny is the last person in the cabin, and is fired. Burns is informed that the completion time of the competition has set a new record, and decides that no one will be fired after all.|$|E
5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E
50|$|In {{the classic}} Pulfrich effect experiment, a subject views a {{pendulum}} swinging {{in a plane}} perpendicular to the observer's line of sight. When a neutral density filter (a darkened lens—typically gray) is placed in front of, say, the right eye, the pendulum seems to take on an elliptical orbit, appearing closer as <b>it</b> swings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> right and farther as <b>it</b> swings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> left, so {{that if it were}} to theoretically be viewed from above, it would appear to be revolving counterclockwise. Conversely, if the left eye is covered, the pendulum would appear to be revolving clockwise-from-top, appearing closer as <b>it</b> swings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> left and farther as <b>it</b> swings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|R

5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

25|$|The LBK did {{not begin}} with this range and only reached <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of its time. It began in regions of densest {{occupation}} on the middle Danube (Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary) and spread over about 1,500km along the rivers in 360 years. The rate of expansion was therefore about 4km per year, which can hardly be called an invasion or a wave by the standard of current events, but over archaeological time seems especially rapid.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown giant squid feed on deep-sea fish and other squid species. They catch prey using the two tentacles, {{gripping}} it with serrated sucker rings on the ends. Then they bring <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> powerful beak, and shred it with the radula (tongue with small, file-like teeth) before it reaches the esophagus. They {{are believed to be}} solitary hunters, as only individual giant squid have been caught in fishing nets. Although the majority of giant squid caught by trawl in New Zealand waters have been associated with the local hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) fishery, hoki do not feature in the squid's diet. This suggests giant squid and hoki prey on the same animals.|$|E
25|$|SIUE hosted Missouri State in a Tuesday night MVC match. The Bears, {{riding a}} three-game win streak, struck early, {{tallying}} on a 3rd minute corner that was {{headed into the}} net. The Cougars got the tying goal in the 34th minute, when MSU was called for a handball in the box, and Ledbetter nailed his third penalty kick of the season. The game then became a typical Valley defensive struggle, as both offenses pushed, but both defenses pushed back harder. Late in regulation time, the Bears turned away a Cougar corner kick, but McHugh sent it back in to Ledbetter, who headed <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> goal and McLean. who scored his second game-winner with only {{a minute and a}} half left on the clock. The win upped the Cougars' unbeaten run to five games.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few more}} hours, the strikers {{attempted}} to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors are ambush predators, {{so often}} lie {{in wait for}} an {{appropriate}} prey to come along, when they attack. However, they have also been known to actively hunt, particularly in regions with a low concentration of suitable prey, and this behaviour generally occurs at night. The boa first strikes at the prey, grabbing it with its teeth; it then proceeds to constrict the prey until death before consuming it whole. Unconsciousness and death likely result from shutting off vital {{blood flow to the}} heart and brain, rather than suffocation as was previously believed; constriction can interfere with blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation. This would lead to unconsciousness and death very quickly. Their teeth also help force the animal down the throat while muscles then move <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stomach. It takes the snake about 4–6 days to fully digest the food, {{depending on the size of}} the prey and the local temperature. After this, the snake may not eat for a week to several months, due to its slow metabolism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{position}} of the cupola varied.

Some conductors preferred to have the cupola toward the front, others liked <b>it</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear of the train, and some just did not care. [...] ATSF conductors could refuse to be assigned to a train if they did not have their cabooses turned to face the way they preferred. [...] However, this would be a rare union agreement clause that could be used, but was not a regular issue.|$|E
