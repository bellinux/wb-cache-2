40|$|AbstractPreviously {{we showed}} that {{preincubation}} of cells with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) resulted in a marked increase in Fe uptake from both 59 Fe-transferrin (Tf) and 59 Fe-citrate (D. R. Richardson, E. Baker, J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 13972 – 13979; D. R. Richardson, P. Ponka, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1269 (1995) 105 – 114). This Fe uptake process was independent of the transferrin receptor {{and appeared to be}} activated by free radicals generated via the iron-catalysed Haber-Weiss reaction. To further understand this process, the present investigation was performed. In these experiments, cells were preincubated for 3 h at 37 °C with FAC or metal ion solutions and then labelled for 3 h at 37 °C with 59 Fe-Tf. Exposure of cells to FAC resulted in Fe uptake from 59 Fe-citrate that became saturated at an Fe concentration of 2. 5 μM, while FAC-activated Fe uptake from Tf was not saturable up to 25 μM. In addition, the extent of FAC-activated Fe uptake from citrate was far greater than that from Tf. These results suggest a mechanism where FAC-activated Fe uptake from citrate may result from direct interaction with the transporter, while Fe uptake from Tf appears indirect and less efficient. Preincubation of cells with FAC at 4 °C instead of 37 °C prevented its effect at stimulating 59 Fe uptake from 59 Fe-Tf, suggesting that an active process was involved. Previous studies by others have shown that FAC can increase ferrireductase activity that may enhance 59 Fe uptake from 59 Fe-Tf. However, {{there was no difference in}} the ability of FAC-treated cells compared to controls to reduce ferricyanide to ferrocyanide, suggesting no change in oxidoreductase activity. To examine if activation of this Fe uptake mechanism could occur by incubation with a range of metal ions, cells were preincubated with either FAC, ferric chloride, ferrous sulphate, <b>ferrous</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> gallium nitrate, copper chloride, zinc chloride, or cobalt chloride. Stimulation of 59 Fe uptake from Tf was shown (in order of potency) with ferric chloride, ferrous sulphate, <b>ferrous</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> and gallium nitrate. The other metal ions examined decreased 59 Fe uptake from Tf. The fact that redox-active Cu(II) ion did not stimulate Fe uptake while redox-inactive Ga(III) did, suggests a mechanism of transporter activation not solely dependent on free radical generation. Indeed, the activation of Fe uptake appears dependent on the presence of the Fe atom itself or a metal ion with atomic similarities to Fe (e. g. Ga) ...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Asexual {{sporulation}} is {{a common}} reproductive mode for {{a diverse group of}} fungi and the ultimate limiting factor in fungal biomass production. Approach: Delaying sporulation may increase the biomass in terms of mycelial production and the same time increase production of enzymes. Results: In order to delay the sporulation different levels of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (10, 12 and 14 %) were added in culture media as nitrogen source for fungus. It was observed that addition of 14 % <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was the best concentration to add in culture during Solid State Fermentation (SSF) of substrate (Palm Kernel Cake (PKC) + Rice Bran) by Aspergillus niger to delay sporulation. Adding <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> also increased the digestibility of fiber in the Fermented Substrate (FS). In addition very low sporulation was observed even after 72 h of fermentation. The development of spore forming was inhibited or delayed when <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was added compared to the control. Similarly, both NDF and ADF content of FS were decreased in the treatment groups. The higher the <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> added to the medium, the lower the NDF and ADF contents of FS although the differences of NDF content were not significant after 3 days or 4 days fermentation.. Conclusion/Recommendations: It was concluded that adding 14 % <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> significantly delayed sporulation and increased fungal biomass production in a solid state fermentation system...|$|R
