In line with this aim, {{the association}} initiates, sponsors and supports the <b>holding</b> <b>of</b> <b>seminars</b> on the teaching of history in Manila and {{in different parts of}} the country. Projects: Akademyang PangkasaysayanIn 1996, the association brought one step higher its mission of enhancing the teaching of history. It had been widely observed that many teachers of Philippine history in the secondary and tertiary levels are not majors in history. The association sought the endorsement of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports and the Commission on Higher Education to allow it to conduct accreditation seminars that would be carried out under the program called Akademyang Pangkasaysayan. As far as it was possible, the seminars would be held in Northern Philippines, Southern Philippines, National Capital Region, Visayas and Mindanao.|$|E

These share many features: both are composed of sub-units organised according to conventional rules; both vary pitch, temporal and rhythmic features to convey meaning; they utilise specific writing systems; and they organise coordinated or joint social actions. However, the debate is still open concerning the evolutionary relationship between language and music, their boundaries (what is unique and specific to each) {{and whether or not they}} belong to separate domains/modules. Such issues are being explored through these seminars, with a focus on: 1. Development and Evolution; 2. Meaning and Entrainment; 3. Literacy and Interaction/Pragmatics...|$|R

40|$|The SUV {{has grown}} from a small group of members in 1994, and over a period of ten years has been {{successful}} in the fulfillment of its primary objective, the strengthening of relations among members who are academic archivists in universities and research institutions thru the <b>holding</b> <b>of</b> annual <b>seminars</b> and conferences. Little has been done, sadly, towards the promotion of a very important objective, i. e., archival cooperation in the fields of documentation, bibliographic access, digitization, open access scholarly publishing, and related activities that would enhance the networking and linkage capabilities among academic archivists, particularly those in. the disadvantaged regions as well as in developing nations. The strategic development of archives in the region through collaboration, partnering schemes, and networking can create an information-rich environment, and wide opportunities to benefit from shared information resources. Part of the success of ICA-SUV will largely depend on how well its members can exploit these networking opportunities, and contribute to the development and growth of archival knowledge on a global scale. This paper aims to bring out the spirit of cooperation among the members by promoting the development of sustainable short-term projects that are doable and mutually beneficial, and thereby contribute to the increased access to archival knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The <b>holding</b> <b>of</b> a <b>seminar</b> on {{the future}} for ‘small farms’ {{requires}} us to consider {{what is meant by}} a ‘small farm’. This is not as straightforward as might be imagined. It presupposes an unambiguous definition of what constitutes ‘a farm’ and a means of distinguishing those farms which are considered to be ‘small’ from the remainder of other farms, that is larger farms. This in turn presupposes an accepted measure of farm size (or amalgam of such measures) and adoption of an agreed size threshold below which farms might be described as ‘small’. However the choices in respect of measure of farm size and threshold for a farm being considered as ‘small’ may depend, respectively, on the particular policy context (for example, contribution to output or employment or land use) and the size distribution of farms within the country(ies) in question. In particular, and analogous with the definition of poverty, there is a choice to be made as to whether farm size is to be assessed in absolute or relative terms. If the former, virtually all farms in some countries may be considered to be small; if the latter, the existence of a ‘small farm’ sector will inevitably continue.
