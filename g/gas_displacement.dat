The <b>gas</b> (He) <b>displacement</b> pycnometry system, Accupyc™ II 1340 by Micromeritics is much more accurate and easier to use. It is faster than liquid-based techniques because the gases fill the pore spaces easily, quickly, and thoroughly.|$|R

40|$|Density {{perturbations}} {{in the hot}} gas in galaxy clusters can {{be caused}} by a variety of processes, e. g. shocks and sound waves, slow <b>gas</b> <b>displacements</b> in pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas, bubbles of relativistic plasma, etc. Each type of perturbations will appear different in soft- and hard-band X-ray images, since the former is only density-dependent, while the latter is also temperature-dependent. High spatial resolution of Chandra allows us to probe statistics of density perturbations on a broad range of spatial scales, down to microphysical scales. I will show the results of auto- and cross-spectra analysis of fluctuations in soft and hard bands in the core of the Perseus cluster which reveal the primary energy-transporting mechanism in the radio-mode feedback. The analysis shows big potential, although low photon statistics and lack of high-spectral-resolution data significantly limit the analysis. Future X-ray missions with large effective area, similar to Chandra spatial resolution and few eV spectral resolution, like X-ray Surveyor, will allow us to use the whole power of such statistical methods. At the end of my talk I will briefly discuss future perspectives with X-ray Surveyor...|$|R
30|$|Carbon dioxide {{flooding}} is {{an effective}} means of enhanced oil recovery for low permeability reservoirs. If fractures are present in the reservoir, CO 2 may flow along the fractures, resulting in low <b>gas</b> <b>displacement</b> efficiency. Reservoir pore pressure will fluctuate to some extent during a CO 2 flood, causing a change in effective confining pressure. The result is rock deformation and a reduction in permeability with the reduction in fracture permeability, causing increased flow resistance in the fracture space. Simultaneously, gas cross flowing along the fractures is partially restrained. In this work, the effect of stress changes on permeability was studied through a series of flow experiments. The change in the flowrate distribution in a matrix block and contained fracture with an increase in effective pressure were analyzed. The results lead to an implicit comparison which shows that permeability of fractured core decreases sharply with an increase in effective confining pressure. The fracture flowrate ratio declines and the matrix flowrate ratio increases. Fracture flow will partially divert to the matrix block with the increase in effective confining pressure, improving <b>gas</b> <b>displacement</b> efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} of miscible and near-miscible gas injection processes {{is available through}} conventional finite difference (FD) compositional simulation. Streamline methods have also been developed in which fluid is transported along the streamlines instead of using the finite difference grid. In streamline-based simulation, a 3 D flow problem is decoupled into a set of 1 D problems solved along streamlines. This reduces simulation time relative to FD simulation, and suppresses the numerical dispersion errors that are present in FD simulations. Larger time steps and higher spatial resolution can be achieved in these simulations. Thus, streamline-based reservoir simulation can be orders of magnitude faster than the conventional finite difference methods. Streamline methods are traditionally only applied to incompressible flow processes. In this paper, the method is adopted and assessed for application to compressible flow processes. A detailed comparison is given between the results of conventional FD simulation and the streamline approach for <b>gas</b> <b>displacement</b> processes. Finally, some guidelines are given on how the streamline method can potentially be used to good effect for <b>gas</b> <b>displacement</b> processes...|$|E

Two sets of identical calculations were conducted: 1 D and 2 D immiscible <b>gas</b> <b>displacement</b> of oil. Subsequently, numerical models of compressible and incompressible gas injection scenarios were simulated. For both 1 D and 2 D cases, varying parameters included injected gas (CO_ 2, CH_ 4 and N_ 2), as well as initial and maximal reservoir pressures (see Table  2).|$|E
30|$|Upon {{injection}} (A on Fig.  2), the displacing gas (CO 2 /CH 4) will diffuse and dissolve {{rapidly in}} the (crude oil + brine)-rich phase (AB).

In some fractured reservoirs, a gas pressure gradient {{of the order}} of 0. 1 psi/ft may be established in the fractures due to flow. Such a pressure gradient could result in recovery enhancement of the matrix oil. Several tests were conducted to study viscous displacement in fractured porous media.

Numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental data. In Task 5, the authors propose a method which accounts for reinfiltration and capillary continuity not only within a grid cell, but also between various grid cells. A reinfiltration term is added to the dual-porosity model and the exchange term between the matrix and the fracture is calculated in a simple manner.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the viability of these non-gravitational torques to take the gas off the plane. We show that magnetically generated warps are clearly flawed because they would wrap up into a spiral {{in less than two}} or three galactic rotations. The inclusion of any magnetic diffusivity to dilute the wrapping effect, causes the amplitude of the warp to damp. We also consider observational consequences of the accretion of an intergalactic plane-parallel flow at infinity. We have computed the amplitude and warp asymmetry in the accretion model, for a disc embedded in a flattened dark matter halo, including self-consistently the contribution of the modes with azimuthal wavenumbers m= 0 and m= 1. This model predicts quite asymmetric warps, maximum <b>gas</b> <b>displacements</b> on the two sides in the ratio 3 : 2 for the preferred Galactic parameters,and the presence of a fraction ~ 3. 5 % of U-shaped warps, at least. The azimuthal dependence of the moment transfer by the ram pressure would produce a strong asymmetry in the thickness of the HI layer and asymmetric density distributions in z, in conflict with observational data for the warp in our Galaxy and in external galaxies. The amount of accretion that is required to explain the Galactic warp would give gas scaleheights in the far outer disc that are too small. We conclude that accretion of a flow with no net angular momentum, cannot be the main and only cause of warps. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

50|$|Gas {{injection}} or {{miscible flooding}} is presently the most-commonly used approach in enhanced oil recovery. Miscible flooding {{is a general}} term for injection processes that introduce miscible gases into the reservoir. A miscible displacement process maintains reservoir pressure and improves oil displacement because the interfacial tension between oil and water is reduced. This refers to removing the interface between the two interacting fluids. This allows for total displacement efficiency.Gases used include CO2, natural gas or nitrogen. The fluid most commonly used for miscible displacement is carbon dioxide because it reduces the oil viscosity and is less expensive than liquefied petroleum <b>gas.</b> Oil <b>displacement</b> by carbon dioxide injection relies on the phase behavior of the mixtures of that gas and the crude, which are strongly dependent on reservoir temperature, pressure and crude oil composition.|$|R

30|$|To {{study how}} {{widespread}} triggered star formation is, {{it is necessary}} to distinguish it from spontaneous star formation. A strong evidence for triggering is considered to be an observation of two or more star forming regions separated by appropriate time intervals, and a morphological structure suggesting that the regions are causally connected. Another piece of evidence comes from the comparison of the mass of the observed objects with analytical estimates predicted for observed density, luminosity and age. Observations (e.g., Deharveng et al. 2010; Simpson et al. 2012; Seleznev, in prep.) and numerical simulations (e.g., Dale et al. 2015) suggest that unambiguous identification of triggered star formation suffers from several limitations, mainly the uncertainty in dating young stellar objects and <b>gas</b> <b>displacement</b> due to feedback; however they indicate that approximately 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of massive star formation is triggered.|$|E
30|$|The Fang- 48 fault block oil {{reservoir}} {{is an extremely}} low permeability reservoir, {{and it is difficult}} to produce such a reservoir by waterflooding. Laboratory analysis of reservoir oil shows that the minimum miscibility pressure for CO 2 drive in Fang- 48 fault block {{oil reservoir}} is 29 MPa, lower than the formation fracture pressure of 34 MPa, so the displacement mechanism is miscible drive. The threshold pressure gradient for gas injection is less than that for waterflooding, and the recovery by gas drive is higher than waterflooding. Furthermore, the threshold pressure gradient for carbon dioxide injection is smaller than that for hydrocarbon gas, and the oil recovery by carbon dioxide drive is higher than that by hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> <b>displacement,</b> so carbon dioxide drive is recommended for the development of the Fang- 48 fault block oil reservoir.|$|E
40|$|An {{acoustic}} {{model is}} developed {{to predict the}} acoustic pressure waves generated by rotary positive <b>displacement</b> <b>gas</b> meters. The meter is approximated, in the long wavelength limit, to a small, rigid and circular piston, pulsating with harmonic time dependence inside an infinite baffle. The acoustic source volume velocity is first derived from the geometry of the measuring part of the meter. Rayleigh's formulation is then applied to derive the acoustic pressure fields of the meter for both the unducted and the ducted situations. The effects of the self-induced pressure waves on the registration of the meter are then considered. The performance of the meter {{is dependent on the}} configuration of the pipe network to which the meter is attached. The meter calibration curve can be seriously distorted by the self-induced acoustic pressure waves. The effectiveness of concentric Helmholtz type resonators to suppress undesired sound pressure waves in meter systems is discussed.
