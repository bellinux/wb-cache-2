He <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of {{the running of the}} club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement {{that he would not be}} sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

They noted investigators could not interview any {{of the most important}} figures in the scandal, and contended that Mastro had a conflict of interest since his firm was politically tied to Christie. Wisniewski and Weinberg, co-chairs of the legislature investigative committee, criticized the report as incomplete and potentially biased since it was prepared by lawyers hired by the Christie administration, and the lawyers did not interview key figures in the scandal.

Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report {{was turned over to}} the state attorney general for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, [...] "I don't see anything in this audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going to be excited about."

500|$|On January 24, 1994, {{prosecutors}} {{announced that}} they would be not bringing charges against Evan Chandler for attempted extortion as Jackson's camp has been slow to report the extortion claim to the police and had tried to negotiate a settlement with Chandler for several weeks. Evan had first made his demand for a financial settlement on August 4, 1993, and the Jackson camp filed extortion charges against Evan and his attorney Barry K. Rothman in late August 1993. After tape recordings supporting the extortion claim were released to the media on August 30, a lawyer for Jackson explained they had not gone to the police earlier because, [...] "It was our hope that this would all go away. We tried to keep it as much in-house as we could." [...] Jackson had already experienced years of bizarre rumors and speculation. In the extortion investigation, a search warrant was never sought to search the homes and offices of Evan Chandler and Barry Rothman and no grand jury was convened when both men <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> by police. In contrast, the police searched Jackson's residences solely based on Jordan's allegations reported by a psychiatrist with no particular expertise in child sexual abuse and increased their efforts to investigate Jackson after no supporting evidence was found in their raids and after questioning almost 30 children (Jackson's phonebooks were seized) and their families, all of whom said Jackson had done nothing wrong. Officers flew to the Philippines to interview two ex-housekeepers who had sold a molestation story to the tabloids but decided it lacked credibility. Several parents also complained to one of Jackson's attorneys of aggressive investigative techniques by the police; allegedly frightening their children with lies, e.g. ‘We have nude photos of you', to pressure them into accusing Jackson and unequivocally telling parents their children had been molested even though their children had denied being victimized.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Domestic/international Gastroenterology Surveillance Study (DIGEST) {{examined}} {{the prevalence of}} upper gastrointestinal symptoms among the general population in 10 countries, {{and the impact of}} these symptoms on healthcare usage and quality of life. This report discusses the validation of the DIGEST sample and reviews the response rates from the survey. METHODS: External validation of the DIGEST sample was conducted by comparing the age, age by gender and annual household incomes of the sample with census-derived data. A comparison was also made between Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) scores from study subjects in the Scandinavian countries and the USA and the total sample population norms. RESULTS: Under- and oversampling, defined as > or = 5 % difference from the population norms, was evident in eight out of 10 countries, but no systematic bias was evident. The final distribution of the sample by gender was 51 % female and 49 % male. Although differences in PGWBI scores were noted between DIGEST subjects and population norms, these differences were < 0. 30 standard deviations [...] markedly below the difference considered as relevant for the PGWBI. Response for the survey in individual countries ranged from 17 % in the USA to 61 % in Norway, with a survey-wide rate of 27 %. The overall response rate, including primary non-respondents, was 13. 4 %. The majority of nonresponse (51. 4 %) <b>was</b> attributed <b>to</b> failure to establish contact with the subjects, with 41. 7 % of subjects <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> and the remaining 6. 9 % of subjects not meeting the age and sex criteria used for the survey.
