Shortly afterwards a fifteen car pile up at the first corner caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. After losing the lead Cecotto was fending off an attack from Leimer through Sainte Dévote but it was not possible for Cecotto to maintain his line and he understeered straight into the barrier. Leimer was trapped in the manoeuvre and mounted the left-hand corner of Cecotto's car in response. Palmer took avoiding action by spinning on the inside line causing the turn to be blocked. Palmer avoided injury when Leal's front wing came close to striking his helmet.|$|E

Giovinazzi similarly made a good start and passed Leclerc for third and attempted an overtaking manoeuvre on Juncadella. By the time the two got to the braking area for the turn, Giovinazzi muscled himself to the inside of Juncadella and the front-right wheel of Giovinazzi's car made contact with Juncadellla's left-rear tyre. Juncadella was sent spinning across the track and into the inside barrier. Tveter was battling with Dennis for position but had no room to negotiate and slammed into the stationary Juncadella. Tveter was hit in turn by Ilott which resulted in the latter's hand becoming bruised and cut. Behind the duo, Jensen struck the rear-end of Albon and the resulting pile up that partially blocked the circuit necessitated the deployment of the safety car.|$|E

50|$|Shortstops are {{required}} to cover second base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman. They also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base, but only when a left-handed hitter is batting. This is because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base, resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base. Shortstops also must cover third at various times, including the rotation play; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base, requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it. Shortstops generally are given precedence on catching pop-ups in the infield as well, so they end up calling off other players many times, although on deep pop-ups they generally fall back when called off by an outfielder. They often become the cutoff man on balls to {{any part of the}} outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base. Depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left <b>field</b> <b>heading</b> home; however, this is usually the job of the third baseman.|$|E
