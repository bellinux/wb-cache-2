5|$|With a {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted {{for several days}} prior {{to the arrival of}} the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30; this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> date for the first hurricane since 1967. Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high pressures {{to the north of the}} hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Hurricane Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour, and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{play has}} been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov's cold-war stage parody, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. The 1961 film of West Side Story—set among New York gangs–featured the Jets as white youths, {{equivalent}} to Shakespeare's Montagues while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of Romeo and Juliet and names many {{of the characters in}} ways that reflect the characters in the play. In 2006, Disney's High School Musical made use of Romeo and Juliet plot, placing the two young lovers in different high school cliques instead of feuding families. Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet. The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times, including John Madden's 1998 Shakespeare in Love, in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called Romeo x Juliet, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success. In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of Romeo and Juliet. The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad. The film was released internationally in April 2014.|$|E
