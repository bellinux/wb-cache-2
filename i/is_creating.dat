5|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{presents}} evidence that globalization <b>is</b> <b>creating</b> a new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E
5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything.

The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change <b>is</b> <b>creating</b> other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E

5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain <b>is</b> <b>creating.</b> Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E
