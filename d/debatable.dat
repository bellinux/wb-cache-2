5|$|The {{validity}} of these accounts is <b>debatable.</b> In Roman political culture, insanity and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba's date {{of birth}} {{including}} his birthplace remains unknown and is <b>debatable</b> {{due to lack of}} evidence and no definitive information exists to prove it.|$|E
5|$|These maps also {{differed}} {{somewhat in}} the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the Aegean Sea and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman Rumelia) was <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension is <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nielsen did not record {{any of his}} works. However, three younger {{contemporary}} conductors who {{had worked}} with him, Thomas Jensen, Launy Grøndahl, and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first LP recording of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete Carl Nielsen Edition has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly <b>debatable</b> due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, because of the color pattern around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner and the outer walls, {{and a number of}} smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is <b>debatable</b> for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is <b>debatable.</b> The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000, Florentino Pérez {{was elected}} club president. He vowed in his {{campaign}} to erase the club's €270million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro. It is <b>debatable</b> whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed {{to win a major}} trophy for the next three seasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is <b>debatable</b> as to which band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to {{identify}} as Christian metal. Stryper gained attention with their way of throwing Bibles to the audience at their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is <b>debatable,</b> and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is <b>debatable,</b> and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is <b>debatable</b> whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is <b>debatable</b> {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E
5|$|John FitzAlan {{was born}} at Lytchett Matravers in Dorset on 14 February 1408. He {{was the son of}} John FitzAlan, 3rd Baron Maltravers (13851421) and Eleanor (d. 1455), {{daughter}} of Sir John Berkeley of Beverstone, Gloucestershire. John FitzAlan the elder, through his great-great-grandfather Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, made a claim on the earldom of Arundel after the death of Thomas FitzAlan, 5th Earl of Arundel, in 1415. The claim was disputed, however, by Thomas's three sisters and their families, foremost among these Elizabeth FitzAlan, who had married Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. It is <b>debatable</b> whether Maltravers ever held the title of Earl of Arundel; he was summoned to parliament under this title once, in 1416, but never again. When he died in 1421, the dispute continued under his son, and it was not until in 1433 that the younger John FitzAlan finally had his title confirmed in parliament. Four years earlier, in July 1429, he had received his late father's estates and title.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{response}} to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued {{when it was clear}} that Louis VII of France would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is <b>debatable</b> whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about Quantum Praedecessores. In any case, Abbot Suger and other nobles were not in favour of Louis' plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted Bernard of Clairvaux, who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis' crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.|$|E
5|$|Much of the city's {{housing stock}} was damaged during the war. The {{wreckage}} was cleared {{in an attempt}} {{to improve the quality of}} dwellings after the war, though before permanent accommodation could be built, Portsmouth City Council built prefabs for those who had lost their homes. Between 1945 and 1947, more than 700 prefab houses were constructed– some were erected over bomb sites. The first permanent houses were built away from the city centre to new developments such as Paulsgrove and Leigh Park, with construction of council estates in Paulsgrove being completed in 1953. In Leigh Park, the first housing estates were completed in 1949, though building work in the area continued until 1974. Developers still occasionally find unexploded bombs in the area, such as on the site of the destroyed Hippodrome theatre in 1984. Despite improvements made by the city council to build new accommodation, a survey made in 1955 concluded that 7000 houses in Portsmouth were unfit for human habitation. Following a controversial decision, a whole section of central Portsmouth, including Landport, Somerstown and Buckland, was demolished and replaced by council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The success of the project and the quality of the 70s homes are <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until {{the thirteenth}} century the borders with England were very fluid. Northumbria and Cumbria were annexed to Scotland by David I, but lost under his {{grandson}} and successor Malcolm IV in 1157. The Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) fixed {{the borders of the}} Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, close to the modern boundaries. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the fourteenth century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to annexe a large slice of the Lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. In 1482, Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in Medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for what was to be the final change of hands. The only uncertain area was the small region of the <b>Debatable</b> Lands at the south-west end of the border, which would be divided by a French-mediated commission in 1552.|$|E
25|$|If the {{minority}} objects, those motions are <b>debatable</b> (and therefore {{subject to a}} filibuster) and divisible (meaning {{the minority}} can force them to be debated, and filibustered, separately). Additionally, after the first two motions pass, but before the third does, senators can offer an unlimited number of motions to give the special committee members non-binding instructions, which are themselves <b>debatable,</b> amendable, and divisible. As a result, a determined minority can cause {{a great deal of}} delay before a conference.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} dolphin-safe {{standards}} {{on the price}} of tuna is <b>debatable.</b> While the trend in cost has been downward, critics claim that the price would have dropped much further without the dolphin-safe standards.|$|E
25|$|Rajabov {{suggests}} 3 more syntactical cases, namely possessive 1 (-łay), possessive 2 (-xu) and abessive (-tay). However, {{their status}} is <b>debatable,</b> {{as they seem}} to show both inflectional as well as derivational tendencies.|$|E
25|$|The colours bleu celeste and the U.S. Institute of Heraldry-invented buff have {{sometimes}} been treated (with {{respect to the}} rule of tincture) as if they are metals, though such a treatment is certainly of <b>debatable</b> propriety.|$|E
25|$|This part {{is still}} <b>debatable</b> as Pakistan is {{dependent}} completely on China {{to support them}} in generating energy. Thereby, Pakistan has to wait more years while India has surpassed Pakistan in case of energy dependency.|$|E
25|$|On a {{more general}} level, it remains <b>debatable</b> whether {{recognition}} of one's mirror image implies self-awareness. Likewise, the converse may also false—one may hold self-awareness, but not present a positive result in a mirror test.|$|E
25|$|The {{volcanic}} activity of Nemrut occurred in three stages: {{the formation of}} a cone (pre-caldera stage), the post-caldera stage, and the late stage. Further, divisions are <b>debatable</b> and are based on different interpretations of the stratigraphic data.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>debatable</b> {{point is}} Thietmar's claim that Mieszko subordinated {{himself to the}} King. Most historians {{believe that it was}} only a matter of {{recognition}} of Otto's royal authority. Some suggest that a fealty relationship could in fact be involved.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the playful}} music that accompanies Merry and Pippin in the cornfield is used when Bilbo {{is running out}} of his home. Whether or not there is a {{recurring}} leitmotif contained within the music is <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Their {{operations}} {{were marked by}} prolonged marches through extremely difficult terrain, by underfed troops often weakened by diseases such as malaria and dysentery. There is controversy over the extremely high casualty rate and the <b>debatable</b> military value of {{the achievements of the}} Chindits.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Gilligan's revived {{version of}} {{maternal}} feminism {{say that to}} assume women are all essentially mothers, and that a male culture should be replaced in schools by a female culture, are both <b>debatable</b> in a democracy with diverse views about gender, sexuality and maternal roles.|$|E
25|$|While {{it may be}} <b>debatable</b> whether McCarron's {{vision is}} better or worse for the International Carpenters Union as a whole, {{they are one of}} only a very few International Unions in America whose {{membership}} has been maintained or grown while most other Unions have seen large declines in membership.|$|E
25|$|While most nudists and naturists condemn {{any sort}} of overt sexual activity, the issue of non-sexual {{spontaneous}} erections is highly <b>debatable.</b> Unfortunately, this topic is routinely ignored by anthropologists who study traditional cultures, {{and it is not}} widely known what rules of etiquette exist among peoples who have lived nude since antiquity.|$|E
25|$|An {{article by}} Russell T Davies in the Doctor Who Annual 2006 states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Last Great Time War against the Daleks (see below), which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed. As with all {{spin-off}} media, its canonicity {{in relation to}} the television series is <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, {{a signal}} that {{is closely related to}} black hole Hawking {{radiation}} (see analog gravity) was claimed to have been observed in a laboratory experiment involving optical light pulses. However, the results remain unverified and <b>debatable.</b> Other projects have been launched to look for this radiation within the framework of analog gravity.|$|E
25|$|Exactly {{how much}} {{and the quality of}} Leadbetter's service to the Confederate Army is <b>debatable.</b> Military {{historian}} Ezra J. Warner states he was usually highly thought of by several of his superiors; however Edward Porter Alexander, whom Leadbetter served with during the Knoxville operations, was critical in post-war writings of his involvement and influence in the campaign.|$|E
