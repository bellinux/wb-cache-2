5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} felt <b>guilty</b> <b>as</b> he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were singing about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E

They competed in ECW for approximately six months, until the promotion closed in January 2001 and were on the company's final pay-per-view <b>Guilty</b> <b>as</b> Charged, where they suffered a loss to Jerry Lynn and Cyrus.

5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were <b>guilty</b> <b>as</b> indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} <b>guilty,</b> <b>as</b> {{had been expected}} based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

25|$|A {{statistical}} test procedure {{is comparable to}} a criminal trial; a defendant is considered not <b>guilty</b> <b>as</b> long as his or her guilt is not proven.
