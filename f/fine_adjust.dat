40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reversible watermarking scheme for the 2 D-vector data (point coordinates) which are popularly used in geographical information related applications. This reversible watermarking scheme exploits the high correlation among {{points in the}} same polygon in a map and achieves the reversibility of the whole scheme by an 8 -point integer DCT, which ensures that the original 2 D-vector data can be watermarked during the watermark embedding process and then perfectly restored during the watermark extraction process, with the watermark accurately extracted at the same time. In our scheme, we use an efficient highest frequency coefficient modification technique in the integer DCT domain to modulate the watermark bit " 0 " or " 1 ", which can be determined during extraction without any additional information to indicate. To alleviate the visual distortion in the watermarked map caused by the coefficient modification, we propose an improved reversible watermarking scheme based on the original coefficient modification technique. Combined with this improved scheme, the embedding capacity can be greatly increased while the watermarking distortion is otherwise deduced compared to the original coefficient modification scheme. To control the distortion between the watermarked 2 D-vector data and its original version, we design an error estimation method to prevent those data which are able to cause large distortions in the coefficient modification process from being watermarked. This distortion limitation scheme can <b>fine</b> <b>adjust</b> the watermarking distortion and capacity for the proposed coefficient modification based reversible watermarking scheme according to different practical requirements...|$|E

40|$|Osteoclasts are {{specialised}} bone-resorbing cells. This particular ability makes osteoclasts irreplaceable for {{the continual}} physiological process of bone remodelling {{as well as}} for the repair process during bone healing. Whereas the effects of systemic diseases on osteoclasts have been described by many authors, the spatial and temporal distribution of osteoclasts during bone healing seems to be unclear so far. In the present study, healing of a tibial osteotomy under standardised external fixation was examined after 2, 3, 6 and 9 weeks (n = 8) in sheep. The osteoclastic number was counted, the area of mineralised bone tissue was measured histomorphometrically and density of osteoclasts per square millimetre mineralised tissue was calculated. The osteoclastic density in the endosteal region increased, whereas the density in the periosteal region remained relatively constant. The density of osteoclasts within the cortical bone increased slightly over the first 6 weeks, however, there was a more rapid increase between the sixth and ninth weeks. The findings of this study imply that remodelling and resorption take place already in the very early phase of bone healing. The most frequent remodelling process can be found in the periosteal callus, emphasising its role as the main stabiliser. The endosteal space undergoes resorption in order to recanalise the medullary cavity, a process also started in the very early phase of healing at a low level and increasing significantly during healing. The cortical bone adapts in its outward appearance to the surrounding callus structure. This paradoxic loosening is caused by the continually increasing number and density of osteoclasts in the cortical bone ends. This study clearly emphasises the osteoclastic role especially during early bone healing. These cells do not simply resorb bone but participate in a <b>fine</b> <b>adjusted</b> system with the bone-producing osteoblasts in order to maintain and improve the structural strength of bone tissue...|$|R

Methods This study explored the role of p 53, p 16, bcl- 2, ki- 67, c-myc, Rb and EGFR, by using Immunohistochemistry assay, in 45 SBT and 39 NSBT patients in comparison with 16 schistosomal chronic cystitis (SC), 28 non-schistosomal chronic cystitis (NSC), and 20 normal control (CTL) subjects. The studied markers in SBT and NSBT were correlated with different clinicopathological criteria namely, tumor histopathology, grading, invasiveness, stage, and presentation of the disease. Results SBT was associated with high grade invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) while NSBT was associated with lower grade less invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). The expression of p 53, bcl- 2, c-myc, and EGFR was higher in SBT than in NSBT while Rb was higher in NSBT than in SBT. However, p 16 and ki- 67 were not different between SBT and NSBT. The profile of molecular markers in SC was similar to NSC except for EGFR which was higher in SC than in NSC. Both SC and NSC showed higher level of p 53, bcl- 2, ki- 67, and EGFR than in CTL group while p 16, Rb, and c-myc were not different. p 53 was associated with high grade SCC in both SBT and NSBT. Bcl- 2 was associated with high grade invasive tumors in SBT and NSBT. P 16 was associated with low grade, late stage, and recurrent SBT and high grade, invasive, late stage, and recurrent NSBT. Rb was associated with SCC in SBT, invasive tumors in NSBT, and late stage and recurrent presentation in both SBT and NSBT. C-myc was associated with high grade, invasive, and late stage SBT and SCC, high grade, invasive, and late stage NSBT. EGFR was associated with invasive SCC in SBT and invasive, high grade, and late stage TCC in NSBT. ki- 67 was associated with invasive SBT and high grade late stage NSBT.

40|$|Although {{there are}} many pogresses in the trauma {{surgical}} research, there are healing complications in about ten to twenty percent of fracture therapies (Haas, 2000). The purpose of the trauma surgical treatment is a fast and total restoration of {{the function of the}} musculosceletal system. This is only possible with {{a better understanding of the}} complex interaction between the mechanical and biological factors during the <b>fine</b> <b>adjusted</b> process of fracture healing. In a previous animal study the magnitude for shear movements, inducing on the one hand a perfect and on the other a less effective healing, was defined. Based on a validatet musculosceletale model of the sheep’s hind leg, a special shear-flexible external fixator was designed for this project, which creates mechanical conditions known to hinder the healing process in the clinic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of determined critical mechanical conditions on the callus modulation and differentiation in comparison to the healing results induced by perfect mechanical conditions from a previous study. For this study 32 sheep were stabilized by a monolateral critical external fixator. All sheep underwent a standardized osteotomy of the right tibia with an identical three millimetre wide osteotomy-gap. After the observation period of two, three, six or nine weeks the animals were sacrificed, and then radiological, biological and biomechanical analyses were performed. During the observation time of nine weeks all sheep showed an incomplete fracture healing of the osteotomy gap. After nine weeks all sheep showed a small continous fracture line in the fracture callus, which histologically consists of cartilage and connective-tissue. By comparing with the results of the previous study, the hypothesis is confirmed, that the critical mechanical conditions in this study induced a delayed fracture healing: under perfect mechanical conditions, bony bridging occured in most of the tibiae after six and in all tibiae after nine weeks. The poor torsional stiffness after six and nine weeks also suggests a hardly advanced healing progress. In 50 percent of the cases the biomechanical testing was not possible due to immature callus tissue. Between six and nine weeks no increase in torsional stiffness was found in biomechanical testing. The reasons of the delayed bone healing are the very critical mechanical conditions. The results demonstrate that the process and the score of the bone healing are influenced by the biomechanical circumstances. To make a more precise statement of the healing process and its healing results, the chosen observation time period of nine weeks is too short. After nine weeks a delayed bone healing with activ courses of the healing was observed, which could presumably lead to a healing of the fragments in the future but may also end in a hypertrophic pseudarthrosis. To evaluate this precisely, the testing period must be longer, which is already planned in a further project. The new perceptions about the histological steps of the delayed fracture healing under defined mechanical circumstances could help to figure out the possibilities and boundaries of an osteosynthesis. In this way a non-problematic healing could be realized even for complex fractures...|$|R
