40|$|The nickel-base {{superalloy}} MAR- 246 (Hf) was {{studied to}} determine the factors affecting basic morphology and fatigue properties. Of particular interest was the degradation of fatigue properties with deviation from the 001 growth orientation. Examination of directionally solidified samples showed a dependence of carbide shape and <b>interdentritic</b> <b>segregation</b> on growth rate. Heat treatment studies focused on the gamma prime structure, determining that it reaches maximum growth after twenty-four hours but its size and stability depends on {{the temperature of the}} treatment. Fatigue test specimens were oriented crystallographically in the failed and unfailed regions and found to have rotated their orientation during the testing if they were located a significant distance from 001. This would place increased strain on the crystal and precipitate early failure...|$|E
