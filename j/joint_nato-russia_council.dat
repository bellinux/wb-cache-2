5000|$|The {{heads of}} state for NATO Allies and Russia gave a {{positive}} assessment of <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> achievements in a Bucharest summit meeting in April 2008, though both sides have expressed mild discontent {{with the lack of}} actual content resulting from the council. In January 2009, the Russian envoy to NATO Dmitry Rogozin said the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>council</b> was [...] "a body where scholastic discussions were held." [...] A US official shared this view, stating: [...] "We want now to structure cooperation more practically, in areas where you can achieve results, instead of insisting on things that won't happen." ...|$|R
50|$|The 2002 Rome summit was an {{exceptional}} (and thus unnumbered) NATO summit of NATO and Russia {{at the level}} of Heads of State and Government. NATO Allies and the Russian Federation created the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council,</b> which replaced the <b>NATO-Russia</b> Permanent <b>Joint</b> <b>Council.</b> The summit was held in the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base outside Rome because of outstanding security requirements soon after the 9/11 attacks.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> {{was created}} on 28 May 2002 during the 2002 NATO Summit in Rome.

On 28 May 2002, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Russian Federation adopted a Declaration in Rome on "NATO-Russian Relations: A New Quality. " The Declaration replaced the Permanent Joint Council (PJC) with the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> (NRC) {{as the new}} venue for consultation, cooperation, joint decision and joint action. This thesis analyzes the origins and prospects of the NRC. It provides background on Moscow's relations with NATO from 1990 to 1997. It analyzes the PJC, which was established by the May 1997 Founding Act, notably {{with regard to the}} key events in the PJC's history and its merits and shortcomings. Although the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States led to a new era in NATO-Russia relations, each side has pursued this new relationship because of its own motives. The thesis analyzes the Rome Declaration and discusses the key differences between the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> and its predecessor, the PJC. It also assesses the NRC's progress to date and its visible and potential problems. The thesis concludes that the prospects for the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> depend in large part on the political will of the participating governments. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
50|$|In Sept 2010, in New York, the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> met for {{the first}} time after {{relations}} were suspended as a result of the 2008 Russia-Georgia war of 2008; on the eve of the meeting, the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO, Ivo Daalder, mentioned the hypothetical possibility of Russia joining NATO.|$|R
50|$|In July 2017, the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> met in Brussels. Following the meeting, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg {{said that}} Allies and Russia {{had had a}} ″frank and {{constructive}} discussion″ on Ukraine, Afghanistan, and transparency and risk reduction. The two sides briefed {{each other on the}} upcoming Russia′s/Belarus′ Zapad-2017 exercise, and NATO′s Exercise Trident Javelin 2017, respectively.|$|R
2500|$|Berlusconi {{advocated}} the accession of Turkey to the EU (notwithstanding {{the opposition of}} coalition partner Lega Nord) and at the 2002 Rome summit a <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> was set up.

5000|$|... "Joint {{decisions}} and actions", taken under <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> agreements, include fighting terrorism, military cooperation (joint military exercises and personnel training), cooperation on Afghanistan (Russia providing training courses for anti-narcotics officers from Afghanistan and Central Asia countries {{in cooperation with}} the UN), transportation by Russia of non-military freight in support of NATO's ISAF in Afghanistan, industrial cooperation, cooperation on defence interoperability, non-proliferation, and other areas.|$|R
5|$|The <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> {{meeting was}} mostly {{noted by the}} absence of both Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin and of any progress concerning the ratification of the adapted CFE treaty or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia and Moldova. NATO leaders further welcomed progress made by Ukraine towards membership in the NATO-Ukraine Commission meeting and discussed some general and mostly symbolic topics with its non-NATO counterparts during the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council meeting.|$|R
25|$|The United States and Russia have {{conducted}} joint military maneuvers, training and counter-terrorist exercises in Germany. This {{was done in}} hopes to strengthen relations with the United States and Russia. The Russian president has also proposed that the United States and Russia put a joint missile defense system in Azerbaijan, a proposal being considered by the United States. In 2008, in response to tensions over Georgia, the United States had cancelled its most recent <b>joint</b> <b>NATO-Russia</b> military exercises.|$|R
50|$|Meetings between Canadian and Russian representatives {{regularly}} {{occur at}} the highest levels. Prime Minister Harper and President Putin met {{for the second time}} at the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm. They first met at the G8 Summit in St. Petersburg in 2006, where they issued joint statements on Canada-Russia Relations and Canada-Russia Energy Cooperation. Canada and Russia cooperate extensively {{within the framework of the}} UN, G8, APEC, <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council,</b> and other multilateral fora.|$|R
50|$|In October 2010, Rasmussen {{announced}} that Russian President Dimitry Medvedev would {{be present at}} the summit. Medvedev agreed to attend after meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The summit then held {{the first meeting of}} the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> since it was created in 2002. Relations between Russia and the alliance had been strained following the 2008 South Ossetia war, when Russia supported and recognized the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia.|$|R
5000|$|Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation, {{arrived in}} Bucharest to {{participate}} in Friday's <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> session. President Putin will present {{to the members of}} the Alliance Moscow's point of view regarding the future collaboration in the Council, and the challenges that the contemporary world faces. President Putin attended the summit with a positive attitude and wanted to avoid the disputes relating to recognition of the Kosovo province or the missile shield, and the speech of the Russian President was expected to be moderate.|$|R
5000|$|During {{a speech}} on the second conference day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg {{described}} the situation between the West and Russia from the Alliance's perspective. He called Russia's actions an attempt to destabilize and intimidate the Western security order and Russia's western-oriented neighbors. In response to this strategy, Stoltenberg reaffirmed the joint solidarity among NATO members and stressed the readiness of the Alliance for collective defense. He also called for the examination of renewed talks within the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council.</b> Stoltenberg stated: [...] "We {{do not want a}} new Cold War with Russia".|$|R
500|$|The 2004 Istanbul summit {{consisted}} of four main meetings, all {{held in the}} Istanbul Lütfi Kırdar Convention and Exhibition Center: the North Atlantic Council (NATO's highest decision-making body, attended by heads of state and government {{from each of the}} 26 Alliance member countries); the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> (which met only at the level of foreign ministers, since Russian President Vladimir Putin stayed away, reflecting ongoing tension between NATO and Russia over NATO enlargement and the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty); the NATO-Ukraine Commission; and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (46 countries including many former Eastern bloc and former Soviet states).|$|R

5000|$|During the 2004 Ukrainian presidential {{election}}, Putin twice visited Ukraine {{before the}} election to show his support for Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, who was widely seen as a pro-Kremlin candidate, and he congratulated him on his anticipated victory before the official election returns had been in. Putin's personal support for Yanukovych was criticized as unwarranted interference {{in the affairs of}} a sovereign state (See also The Orange revolution). [...] According to a document uncovered during the United States diplomatic cables leak Putin “implicitly challenged" [...] the territorial integrity of Ukraine at the April 4, 2008, <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> Summit in Bucharest, Romania.|$|R

5000|$|In early March 2014, {{tensions}} increased between NATO and Russia as {{a result}} of the Ukrainian crisis and Russia's move to annex of Crimea: NATO urged Russia to stop its actions and said it supported Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. On 1 April 2014, NATO issued a statement by NATO foreign ministers that announced it had [...] "decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between NATO and Russia. Our political dialogue in the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> can continue, as necessary, at the Ambassadorial level and above, to allow us to exchange views, first and foremost on this crisis". The statement condemned Russia’s [...] "illegal military intervention in Ukraine and Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity".|$|R
500|$|One of Clark's most debated {{decisions}} {{during his}} SACEUR command was his attempted operation to attack Russian troops at Pristina International Airport, {{immediately after the}} end of the Kosovo War in June 1999. A <b>joint</b> <b>NATO–Russia</b> peacekeeping operation was supposed to police Kosovo. Russia wanted their peacekeeping force to operate independently of NATO, but NATO refused. British forces were supposed to occupy Pristina International Airport, but a contingent of Russian troops arrived before they did and took control of the airport. Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana, who told him [...] "you have transfer of authority" [...] in the area. General Clark then issued an order for the NATO troops to attack and [...] "overpower" [...] the armed Russian troops.|$|R
40|$|After the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, Russia pinned its {{hopes on}} the {{dissolution}} of NATO and on the OSCE becoming the major regional security organisation in the Euro-Atlantic area. However, taking advantage of Russia’s weakness, NATO went through several enlargement rounds, even incorporating parts of the former Soviet Union. Russia has now recovered and considers that the era of unipolarity is giving way to a "polycentric international system". The war in Georgia and the financial crisis have demonstrated that sufficient critical mass has been achieved to transform the international system. Russia is proposing to fix de jure the political commitments undertaken within the OSCE and the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council.</b> Russia wants a legally binding document, a European Security Treaty. The question is to what extent {{this is in the}} interest of the West...|$|R
5000|$|The {{major new}} {{gameplay}} feature {{is a system}} called [...] "Close-Range Assault" [...] (CRA), which aims to increase the intensity and bring the action closer to the player. The game features two modes of control, named [...] "Optimum"", which prevents the player from doing full rolls, and [...] "Original", which gives the players full control of the aircraft. Co-operative missions and free-for-all Deathmatch have returned, but two new modes named [...] "Capital Conquest" [...] and [...] "Domination" [...] {{were added to the}} game. This is also the first Ace Combat title with a plot mostly written by non-Japanese writers, with noted author Jim DeFelice at the helm. Set in 2015-2016, the game's story mainly focuses on members of the United Nations' 108th Task Force, a <b>joint</b> <b>NATO-Russia</b> military organization primarily assigned to quell a rebellion spreading over East Africa.|$|R

In addition, Russia argued that it faced new threats on its southern borders: the possibility of missile launches from Iran {{and the expansion of}} Islamist terrorism, which required - in the perspective of Russia - Russian military presence in Georgia and Armenia. Colonel Anatoli Tesiganouk, Head of Russia's Military Forecasting Center, argued that NATO took no notice of Russia's position because NATO's leaders still had the same mental stereotypes that took shape during the Cold War; that {{a large part of the}} Western elite still regarded Russia as a kind of USSR, ignoring the fact that Russia [...] has not only new borders, but also new aspirations, new international partners, and new threats. These stereotypes could have wittingly or unwittingly affected the relations in the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|R
40|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War and the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO and Russia concluded that «they no longer regarded each other as adversaries» (NATO, 1997). They also soon began a gradual rapprochement. In 1997, the Founding Act was created, and in 2002, the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> (NRC) was established. The aim of the NRC was to treat the actors as equal partners, build trust, practical cooperation and become the main forum for crisis and security consultation between NATO and Russia (NATO, 2002). Building on Karl Deutsch's (1961) theory, particular emphasis will be put on an incorporation of 'transaction density' and 'mutual responsiveness' as crucial characteristics for the NRC in forwarding a path towards a 'Security Community' between NATO and Russia. From 2002 to 2009, an assessment {{of whether or not the}} NRC has been a success will be presented...|$|R
50|$|Mirroring the {{creation}} in May 2002 of the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council,</b> {{a major step}} forward in NATO's cooperation with Russia, the Assembly created the NATO-Russia parliamentary Committee (NRPC). Until it was discontinued in April 2014, the NATO-Russia Parliamentary Committee met twice a year during each of the Assembly’s sessions in an “at 29” format and had become the main framework for direct NATO-Russia parliamentary relations. It consisted {{of the leaders of the}} Assembly’s 28 member delegations and the leaders of the Russian delegation to the Assembly. In addition to the dialogue held within this the Committee, a 10-person delegation of the Russian Federal Assembly participated in the Assembly's Plenary Sessions as well as in many Assembly Committee and Sub-Committee meetings and seminars. In April 2014, the NATO PA decided to withdraw the Russian Parliament's associate membership of the Assembly, thus effectively ending regular institutional relations with the Russian Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|The US {{supported}} Ukraine's bid to join NATO {{launched in}} January 2008 {{as an effort}} to obtain the NATO Membership Action Plan. Russia strongly opposed any prospect of Ukraine and Georgia becoming NATO members. According to the alleged transcript of Putin’s speech at the 2008 <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> Summit in Bucharest, Putin spoke of Russia’s responsibility for ethnic Russians resident in Ukraine and urged his NATO partners to act advisedly; according to some media reports he then also privately hinted to his US counterpart at the possibility of Ukraine losing its integrity in the event of its NATO accession. According to a document in the United States diplomatic cables leak Putin [...] "implicitly challenged the territorial integrity of Ukraine, suggesting that Ukraine was an artificial creation sewn together from territory of Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and especially Russia {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister of Russia, wields {{less power}} than his [...] "alpha dog" [...] {{image in the}} media portrays. He is alleged to bribe Kremlin figures, or else many of his edicts are not implemented. American diplomats have raised {{concerns}} over personal corruption, calling Putin's Russia a [...] "mafia state". The Swiss oil-trading company Gunvor is [...] "rumored {{to be one of}} Putin's sources of undisclosed wealth", allegedly [...] "bringing its owners billions of dollars in profit". Diplomats have also discussed Putin's very close relationship with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and [...] "the pair enjoyed such a close relationship that they shared a 'direct line'". It is suspected that Berlusconi personal relationship with Putin influenced the sale of part of Russian state-owned Gazprom's oil subsidiary Gazpromneft to Italian Eni. At the April 4, 2008, <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> Summit in Bucharest, Romania Putin [...] "implicitly challenged" [...] the territorial integrity of Ukraine.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDue {{to the recent}} creation of the new <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> on May 28, 2002, driven by the alliance {{in the war against}} terrorism spurred by the September 11, 2001 attacks, it is necessary to explore the implications of possible Russian membership in NATO. Although the creation of this new institution does not indicate the immediate entry or pursuit of a "Membership Action Plan" by Russia into NATO, it does signal the end of nearly a half-century of confrontation between NATO and Russia. It also symbolizes the entrance of a new era of security cooperation, post-Cold War but also post- September 11. The long-term stability and security of North America, Europe, and Russia remain unresolved. To date, the best and most successful security institution in Europe has been NATO. If not today, then sometime in the near future Russian membership in NATO must be addressed. If Russia were to join, then these implications could be a planning guide to ease the entry of Russia into NATO. Captain, United States Arm...|$|R
5000|$|On 20 June 2017, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg {{answering}} {{a question about}} the exercise said: ″We are going to follow and monitor the Zapad exercise area here closely, and all nations have the right to exercise their forces but it is important that nations, be it Belarus or Russia, exercise their forces that they do that in accordance with well established guidelines and agreements and international obligations and we have something called the Vienna document which outlines how exercises have to be notified and be subject to international inspections and we call on Russia and also Belarus to do that in accordance with the Vienna document so that we have transparency, predictability related to Zapad 2017. We are also working in the framework of the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> to have more transparency, predictability, connected to military posture but also exercises, and that is always important but especially important now when we see more military presence along our borders in this region. It’s even more important to have transparency, international observation of exercises like Zapad.″ ...|$|R
50|$|Russia is {{a member}} of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Union of Russia and Belarus, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Paris Club, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). It signed the NATO Partnership for Peace {{initiative}} on 22 June 1994. On 20 May 1997, NATO and Russia signed the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which the parties hoped would provide the basis for an enduring and robust partnership between the Alliance and Russia—one that could make an important contribution to European security architecture in the 21st century, though already at the time of its signing doubts were cast on whether this accord could deliver on these ambitious goals. This agreement was superseded by the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> that was agreed at the Reykjavik Ministerial and unveiled at the Rome NATO Summit in May 2002. On 24 June 1994, Russia and the European Union (EU) signed a partnership and cooperation agreement. In recent years, tensions have heightened, as NATO members in Eastern Europe, especially Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, feel threatened by Russia. European Union imposed sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals in 2014, regarding the annexation of Crimea and alleged support for separatists during Donbass War.|$|R
25|$|As {{one of five}} {{permanent}} members of the UN Security Council, Russia {{plays a major role in}} maintaining international peace and security. The country participates in the Quartet on the Middle East and the Six-party talks with North Korea. Russia is a member of the G8 industrialized nations, the Council of Europe, OSCE, and APEC. Russia usually takes a leading role in regional organisations such as the CIS, EurAsEC, CSTO, and the SCO. Russia became the 39th member state of the Council of Europe in 1996. In 1998, Russia ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. The legal basis for EU relations with Russia is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which came into force in 1997. The Agreement recalls the parties' shared respect for democracy and human rights, political and economic freedom and commitment to international peace and security. In May 2003, the EU and Russia agreed to reinforce their cooperation on the basis of common values and shared interests. Former President Vladimir Putin had advocated a strategic partnership with close integration in various dimensions including establishment of EU-Russia Common Spaces. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia has developed a friendlier relationship with the United States and NATO. The <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council</b> was established in 2002 to allow the United States, Russia and the 27 allies in NATO to work together as equal partners to pursue opportunities for joint collaboration.|$|R
40|$|In {{order for}} NATO to remain {{credible}} and efficient, its new Strategic Concept must address and find solutions to fundamental issues which {{are likely to}} define the Alliance's missions over the next decade, of which the most important ones concern member states' ability to ensure and reinforce their mutual defense and burden-sharing commitments. The challenge of NATO's new Strategic Concept is {{to strike a balance}} between the objectives of deterrence and defense, and stronger security guarantees for member states, on the one hand, as well as greater reassurance to Russia, on the other hand. The document expected to be adopted by NATO member states at the Lisbon Summit should aim at building greater internal commitment and mutual confidence, while identifying more venues of political cooperation with Russia, even outside the <b>NATO-Russia</b> <b>Council.</b> The paper looks closely at those factors which influence the options made by allies when dealing with topics like forward defense, nuclear deterrence and strategic reassurance. The Alliance's new strategic concept is likely to acknowledge the danger posed by unconventional security threats but there are little chances for article 5 of the Washington Treaty to suffer major alterations, although the scope of potential threats has broadened. NATO's nuclear posture will continue to remain strongly linked to that of the United States, while Allies take note of the rising profile of other major nuclear powers on the international scene, the most prominent one being China...|$|R
