500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Russell Tovey would appear in Sherlock series two in its second episode. Tovey, who liked Sherlock for staying true to the style of the novels despite its modern twist, said of the experience: [...] "It's amazing {{to be a part of}} it", adding, [...] "I got to act with Benedict and Martin which was awesome". The actor also explained that during his scenes, [...] "We did about two and a half weeks of night shoots in Cardiff and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> jetlag." [...] In terms of Henry's character, Tovey did not want him to be a [...] "jibbering wreck", but rather mature and truthful as well as damaged and haunted. Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{were made}} for Paynter to run {{additional}} races before the Breeders' Cup Classic in the fall. [...] His next race was the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on July 27, 2013. Shortly after his arrival at Del Mar racetrack in early July, Paynter was profiled on TV, showing that his usual temperament was back to normal, as the camera showed him attempting to nip Baffert. [...] Running {{for the first time}} on a different synthetic surface, Polytrack, in the grade 2 race, Paynter was the 3–5 favorite, and at 122 pounds carried the most weight. [...] After running close to the [...] pace and taking the lead in the homestretch, he lost by a half-length to a late-running horse, Kettle Corn, at the finish. Jockey Bejarano believed the polytrack surface was a factor in his loss. [...] "He never seemed comfortable out there, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> plenty of horse, but he just wasn't liking what he was doing... he didn't have enough at the end." [...] Nonetheless, purse money for his placing put him over one million dollars in lifetime winnings.|$|E
2500|$|He {{turned his}} {{basement}} into [...] practice {{space for a}} band he formed with high-school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high-school shows or other events, he decided {{to drop out of}} high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated when he told her, and he still feels that he owes her for the disappointments in her life. [...] "All the shit I put her through," [...] he says, [...] "on top {{of the fact that she}} just lost her husband. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make sure that it was worth it. I wanted to show her that I was a professional, that I was working hard, and wasn't just a fuckin' lunatic." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jill Lawler: “I felt so disgusting, but I {{just did}} {{what he told me}} to do, which was basically, like, {{manually}} jerk him off. I hated doing it.

2500|$|Blue was {{an almost}} instant {{critical}} and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced [...] "Carey" [...] was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions ("All I Want", [...] "A Case of You"), while others such as [...] "Blue", [...] "River" [...] and [...] "The Last Time I Saw Richard" [...] were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of Blue, [...] "I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, {{but at the time}} of Blue, our pop stars never admitted these things." [...] In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in [...] "California"). Mitchell later remarked, [...] "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Extra at the Vevo Certified SuperFanFest on 8 October 2014, Azalea commented that she was [...] "really excited" [...] about her upcoming release saying that the new material was [...] "uptempo and fun," [...] adding that she [...] "did a lot more collaborations because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> doors open for me and I {{had the opportunity to}} collaborate with artists that I didn't have before when I made my first album, so this time I got to kind of call whoever I wanted up and do my dream collaborations – it's really exciting!" [...] During yet another interview with Radio.com backstage at the CBS Radio We Can Survive concert at the Hollywood Bowl on 24 October 2014, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Ellie Goulding and after meeting several times she was approached by Goulding about a song that would become [...] "Heavy Crown", recalling [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration," [...] because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] Most notably, the track shows off an edgier side of Goulding, whose voice Azalea called [...] "unique and ethereal sounding." [...] "She loved it because she felt like she doesn't do things that are as aggressive as our song together," [...] Azalea explained.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} a young biracial child suffering through domestic violence within their household. The child's parents are dressed as llama/alpaca puppet [...] "monsters". Wentz has stated [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is realizing that your {{place in the world}} is maybe not just what you thought it was growing up. I grew up as a weird kid in a place where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> didn't fit it. It wasn't until punk/rock and stuff where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> found other people who similarly didn't fit in." ...|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{qualifying}} {{session was}} completed, Logano stated, [...] "The track was dirty. When I {{went out there}} and got to that trouble spot, I got loose a little bit and didn't get to the bottom as well as I wanted to. So <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> left a tenth and a half a second or so right there, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> nailed Turns 2 and 3 pretty well. I was hoping {{it would be in the}} top five, and it ended up being good enough." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mackay {{decided to}} leave the Dragons due to a poor {{relationship}} with coach Brian Smith, later saying, [...] "Brian had signed an extension on his contract and so <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> needed a change or I'd go down the drain as a player." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{first record}} came {{together}} very naturally,” Buddy says. “But on this second record <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> {{was not as}} sure of myself or what <b>I</b> was doing. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was riding this wave of energy but not really sure how it felt {{at the end of}} the day. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the record but it didn’t feel authentically me. I think we had an identity crisis. It was a hard decision to put it aside because we had spent a ton of time on it, but there was something missing. I had a responsibility to really stand behind something and focus on the longevity of the project. It should be the best we could do and this wasn’t it. It was really risky. It stopped everything.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Colton {{says that}} the song [...] "sums up my American Idol experience.

5000|$|In 1979 Mitchell reflected, [...] "The Blue album, there's {{hardly a}} dishonest {{note in the}} vocals. At that period of my life, I had no {{personal}} defenses.
