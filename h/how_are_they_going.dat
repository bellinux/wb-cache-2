Enemies that you would watch and say, 'Oh, boy, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> {{to get out of}} this one?' I don't think the Kazon hit the bill." [...] Mulgrew felt the crew's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as [...] "great big stupid giants".|$|E
2500|$|Weeks later, on 10 April, Franklin {{wrote to}} Crick for {{permission}} to see their model. Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson-Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She {{is reported to have}} commented, [...] "It's very pretty, but <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to prove it?" [...] As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson-Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science. Most of the scientific community hesitated several years before accepting the double helix proposal. At first mainly geneticists embraced the model because of its obvious genetic implications.|$|E
2500|$|Fifty {{motions to}} reopen divorce cases {{that had been}} handled by Garson were {{received}} by New York's chief administrative judge for matrimonial cases. Of those, three or four were granted a hearing, and eventually settled. However, even in cases that involved both Garson and Siminovsky, rulings were not necessarily reviewed or overturned. To receive a hearing, parties were required to demonstrate some likelihood {{that they had not}} received a fair trial. Criticizing a process that required parties who did not have subpoena powers or wiretaps to prove corruption in each case, the President of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women said: [...] "The burden of proof is going to fall on them to show the case is corrupted; and <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to do that?" ...|$|E

Formerly, an office {{consisting}} of one employee, {{under the umbrella of}} the History, Arts, and Libraries, staffing levels grew to six employees after film incentives were introduced in 2008. Michelle Begnoche, Public Relations Manager of the Michigan Film Office explains the goal of the film incentive: [...] "The goal of the incentive is not to incentivize the movies that will make the most money; the goal of the film incentive is to incent those movies who will spend the most money in Michigan. So we are not looking at whether or not they get their money back.

In Session 7, by contrast, when Nakyato first presented the colour books, the group was full of questions: <b>How</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to handle them? Should they take them home? Were <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to go through them with their children? At the same time, the participants became far readier to answer Nakyato’s questions. At first the answers usually came from only two people, but later Kirabo noticed that the hands were “shooting up”.

They are understandably worried about their next step as musicians: <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to enter the industry? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to make a living? And because of that, that can trickle down. The nice thing at Oberlin is that they are immensely talented, but they're not really concerned about their future. They might be a little bit, but it's not what occupies their thoughts. They are thinking about music as an art form. They're preoccupied with how they're going to change the artistic culture. And I think that's actually very important." ...|$|E

In time the other sons of Matlebjane, including Mogashoa, got worried that their father would give the kingship to Photo. So this became a sore affair. The issue was very unsettleing also to the other wives. So out of this a bloody political plan was cooked. The three sons Seloane, Masemola, Phaahla including Mogashoa colluded and planned that Matlebjane their father and King of Batau must die. They wanted to kill him.
