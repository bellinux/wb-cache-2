5|$|The {{earliest}} known coins of the Western {{world were}} minted {{in the kingdom}} of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Islamic <b>dirham,</b> the Indian rupee {{from the time of the}} Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.|$|E
5|$|Raju and his team, now {{disguised}} as Sabarimala pilgrims, rent a van {{hoping to catch}} Jayan. Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla (Abu Salim), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai (Joy Mathew). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is {{waiting for him in}} the van. Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 <b>Dirham</b> Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one would suspect the gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is also aware of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh go. It is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji (Suresh Krishna), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.|$|E
25|$|After the {{increase}} the average water tariff varied between <b>Dirham</b> 3.20 per m3 (US$0.29) in Meknes and <b>Dirham</b> 7.18 per m3 (US$0.66) in Casablanca. The sewer tariff varied between <b>Dirham</b> 0.59 per m3 (US$ 0.05) in Oujda and <b>Dirham</b> 1.64 per m3 (US$ 0.15) in Marrakech. In 2002 {{it was decided}} that the sewer tariff in small towns served by ONEP should become uniform for all towns, using an increasing-block structure. The average ONEP sewer tariff was <b>Dirham</b> 1.50 per m3 in 2009. Although a decision has been taken in 2004 to increase the sewer tariff to <b>Dirham</b> 2.00 per m3.

25|$|The {{investments}} {{in the water and}} sanitation sector increased substantially between 2003 and 2005. In urban water distribution it increased from <b>Dirham</b> 0.9bn to 1.5bn, in rural water supply from <b>Dirham</b> 0.5bn to 0.8bn, in water production from 0.3bn to 0.6bn, and in sanitation from <b>Dirham</b> 1.1bn to 2.8bn.

25|$|Furthermore, {{according}} to a World Bank study of 2008, there is a cross-subsidy of about <b>Dirham</b> 1bn from electricity users who are charged distribution tariffs that are above costs. This allows the concessionnaires and the Régies to generate the revenue necessary {{to pay for the}} inflated tariffs for bulk water, which in turn allows ONEE to cross-subsidize rural water supply and sanitation at an amount that is also about <b>Dirham</b> 1bn.|$|E

ONEE is nominally financially autonomous through its tariff revenues, but it receives investment subsidies of <b>Dirham</b> 150 million per year for rural water supply and half its sanitation investments are financed by the government budget and municipalities.
