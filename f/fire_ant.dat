5|$|The red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> {{was first}} introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America. The ants were carried in the soil used as ballast on those ships. They have spread throughout the South and Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> and European <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E

The response of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) to the presence of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (Solenopsis invicta) during the first 6 days post-hatching was examined in a 9 -week-field experiment during spring and summer 1993 in southeastern Texas. Behavior of a focal animal was recorded continuously for 15 min in a 30 M 2 area from which <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> had been removed and in a similar, adjacent area with natural densities of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Activities of a focal animal were categorized as: response to <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> locomotion, inactive, sleeping, and pecking at food. Results suggested red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> can alter the daily activity budgets of northern bobwhite chicks. Time spent responding directly to <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> affected {{the amount of time spent}} performing other behaviors such as locomotion, sleeping, and pecking at food. The degree to which chick behavior was altered depended on season, which affected ant activity levels, and age of the chick, which influenced allotment of time to all activities, including response to <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Shifts in the daily activity budgets of chicks during the first 6 days post-hatching may have cumulative effects that manifest themselves later in life. Ultimately, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may exert natural selection pressures affecting seasonality of nesting in northern bobwhites and other ground-nesting birds...|$|R

5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
25|$|The red {{imported}} ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking S. richteri. The {{two species}} {{can be distinguished}} from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In S. richteri, {{the sides of the}} head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers. The red imported fire ant's promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of invasive species, mainly the red <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> {{has been known}} to disrupt the beetle’s environment. Shallow caves in which the beetle live are relatively easy to enter and make them vulnerable to invasion of fire ants and other exotic species. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies occur in two different forms: single-queen colonies and multiple-queen colonies. It is the multiple-queen colonies that pose a threat because they occur in very dense concentrations of about 750–5000 mounds per acre. They can enter through the cave entrance or crawl through small holes or cracks and attack the karst species where humans cannot observe. Slow moving adults, nymphs, and eggs are most vulnerable to <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> predation. More than 50% of the caves observed had fire ants present. This is a large sign that the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> has taken over or will eventually take over the habitat. Even if the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> does not prey on the beetle it is likely to change the links that are critical in the food chain.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. I compared patch use patterns of deer mice foraging in the presence and absence of a non-conventional predation hazard, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Deer mice foraged for 60 min in an experimental arena containing two rich and two poor resource patches. All patches either had <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> or did not have <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> and were filled with 5 or 16 whole sunflower seeds mixed in with 250 ml sand. Foraging strategy was identified by examining two aspects of patch use: density-dependence of resource harvest and over/underuse of rich patches relative to poor. Deer mice switched from a fixed search time strategy in the absence of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> to a Bayesian strategy in their presence. Resource harvest was density-independent in the absence of <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> meaning the mice harvested the same proportion of seeds from rich and poor patches. In the presence of <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> mice biased effort toward rich patches, resulting in positively density-dependent resource harvest. Mice also made significantly more patch visits, made more out-of-patch foraging bouts (taking seeds to protective cover), and spent more time foraging out of the resource patches in the presence of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Despite any increased costs or lost time due to taking seeds to protective cover, mice harvested the same number of seeds in the same total time at the same overall harvest rate in the presence and absence of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> The increased costs associated with foraging in the presence of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> were compensated for by biasing effort toward rich patches. Mice harvested more seeds, spent more time, and had a disproportionately higher harvest rate in rich patches in the presence of fire ants; there were no differences between use of rich and poor patches in their absence...|$|R

40|$|Studying nonnative species {{soon after}} their {{introduction}} {{is critical to}} understanding their risk of becoming widely invasive and determining effective methods of control. I conducted laboratory and field experiments on the Rasberry crazy ant (Paratrechina sp. nr. pubens), which was introduced to Pasadena, TX in 2002 and has since been spreading rapidly. These experiments focused on intraspecific aggression, {{as well as individual}} and colony-level interactions between crazy ants and red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (Solenopsis invicta), which are dominant in the crazy ant's introduced range. Crazy ants displayed no intraspecific aggression. In individual aggressive encounters with <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> crazy ants had higher mortality than <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> but in colony-level clashes, crazy ants had less mortality and better control of food resources. These findings suggest that crazy ant abundance is key to their competitive success, and <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may provide biotic resistance to crazy ants in some areas...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, the red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> {{first arrived}} in the seaport of Mobile, Alabama, by cargo ship between 1933 and 1945. Arriving with an estimated 9 to 20 unrelated queens, the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> was only rare at the time, as entomologists were unable to collect any specimens (with the earliest observations first made in 1942, preceded by a population expansion in 1937); the population of these ants exploded by the 1950s. Since its introduction to the United States, the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> has spread throughout the southern states and northeastern Mexico, negatively affecting wildlife and causing economic damage. The expansion of red imported fire ants may be limited since they are almost wiped out during Tennessee winters, thus they may be reaching their northernmost range. However, global warming may allow the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> to expand its geographical range. As of 2004, the ant is found in 13 states and occupies over 128 million hectares of land, {{and as many as}} 400 mounds can be found on a single acre of land. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that they expand 193km (120mi) per year.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{and genetic}} {{data suggest that}} the red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> and the black imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis richteri) differ from each other, but they do share a close genetic relationship. Hybridisation between the two ants occurs in areas where they make contact, with the hybrid zone located in Mississippi. Such hybridisation has resulted from secondary contact between these two ants several decades ago, when they first encountered each other in southern Alabama. Based on mitochondrial DNA, examined haplotypes do not form a monophyletic clade. Some of the examined haplotypes form a closer relationship to S. megergates, S. quinquecuspis and S. richteri than they do with other S. invicta haplotypes. The occurrence of a possible paraphyletic grouping suggests that the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> and S. quinquecuspis are possible cryptic species groups composed of several species that cannot be distinguished morphologically.|$|E

25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} are strong competitors with many ant species. They {{have managed to}} displace many native ants {{which has led to}} a number of ecological consequences. However, studies show that these ants are not always superior competitors that suppress native ants. Habitat disturbance prior to their arrival, and recruitment limitations, are more plausible reasons why native ants are suppressed. Between Tapinoma melanocephalum and Pheidole fervida, the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is stronger than both species but shows different levels of aggression. For example, they are less hostile towards T. melanocephalum in contrast to P. fervida. Mortality rates in T. melanocephalum and P. fervida when fighting with red imported fire ants are high, being 31.8% and 49.9% respectively. The mortality rate for red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers, however, is only 0.2% to 12%. The imported crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva) exhibits greater dominance than the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> and has been known to displace them in habitats where they encounter each other in. Larger colonies of pavement ants (Tetramorium caespitum) can destroy red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies, leading entomologists to conclude that this conflict between the two species may help impede the spread of the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> Individuals infected by SINV-1 can be killed faster than healthy individuals by Monomorium chinense. This means that ants infected with SINV-1 are weaker than their healthy counterparts and more than likely will be eliminated by M. chinense. However, major workers, whether they are infected or not, are rarely killed.|$|E
25|$|The red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta), {{also known}} as the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> or RIFA, is a species of ant native to South America. A member of the genus Solenopsis in the subfamily Myrmicinae, it was described by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi as a variant in 1916. Its current name invicta was given to the ant in 1972 as a separate species. However, the variant and species were the same ant, and the name was preserved due to its wide use. The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is native to South America but it has been accidentally introduced in Australia, New Zealand, several Asian and Caribbean countries and the United States. The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is polymorphic as workers appear in different shapes and sizes. The ant's colours are red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or black gaster. However, males are completely black. Red imported fire ants are dominant in altered areas and live {{in a wide variety of}} habitats. They can be found in rain forests, in disturbed areas, deserts, grasslands, alongside roads and buildings, and in electrical equipment. Colonies form large mounds constructed from dirt with no visible entrances because foraging tunnels are built and workers emerge far away from the nest.|$|E
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} have spread beyond North America. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) reports the ant inhabiting from {{three of the}} Cayman Islands. However, the sources the ISSG cited give no report about them on the island, but recent collections indicate that they are present. In 2001, red imported fire ants were discovered in New Zealand, but they were successfully eradicated several years later. Red imported fire ants {{have been reported in}} India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. However, these reports were found to be incorrect as the ants collected there were incorrectly identified as the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> In Singapore, the ants were most likely misidentified as well. In India, surveyed ants in Sattur Taluk, India listed the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> there in high populations; meanwhile, no reports of the ant were made outside the surveyed area. In 2016, scientists state that despite no presence of the ant in India, the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> will more than likely find suitable habitats within India's ecosystem if given the opportunity. The reports in the Philippines most likely misidentified collected material as the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> as no populations have been found there. It was discovered in Hong Kong and mainland China in 2004, where they have spread into several provinces as well as Macau and Taiwan. No geographic or climatic barriers prevent these ants from spreading further, thus it may spread throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. In Europe, a single nest was found in the Netherlands in 2002.|$|E

The team was broken up again in September 2011, when Castagnoli signed with WWE.|$|E
25|$|The ant faces many {{respiratory}} challenges due to {{its highly}} variable environment, which can cause increased desiccation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and hypercapnia can result from red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> may possibly be related to its physiological tolerance to abiotic stress, being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to desiccation stress than S. richteri. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress. Although S. richteri has higher water body content than the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> S. richteri was more vulnerable to desiccation stress. The lower sensitivity to desiccation {{is due to a}} lower water loss rate. Colonies living in unshaded and warmer sites tend to have a higher heat tolerance than those living in shaded and cooler sites.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA variation occurs substantially in polygyne societies (nests with multiple queens), but no variation is detected in monogyne societies (nests {{with a single}} queen).

Despite its spread, S. geminata has a greater geographical range than the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> but it can be easily displaced by it. Because of this, almost all of its exotic range in North America has been lost and the ant has almost disappeared there. On roadsides in Florida, 83% of these sites had S. geminata present when the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> was absent, but only 7% when it is present.
