40|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{interfacial}} area transport equation for the interfacial transfer terms in the two-fluid model, accurate data sets on axial development of local parameters such as void fraction, interfacial area concentration, interfacial gas velocity and Sauter mean diameter are indispensable to verify the modeled source and sink terms in the interfacial area transport equation. From this point of view, local measurements of both group 1 spherical/distorted bubbles and group 2 cap/slug bubbles in vertical upward air–water two-phase flow in a large diameter pipe with 200 mm in inner diameter and 26 m in height were performed at three axial locations of z/D = 41. 5, 82. 8 and 113 as well as 11 radial locations from r/R = 0 – 0. 95 by using four-sensor probe method. Here, z, r, D and R are the axial distance from the inlet, radial distance from the pipe center, pipe diameter and pipe radius, respectively. The liquid flow rate and the void fraction ranged from 0. 0505 m/s to 0. 312 m/s and from 1. 98 % to 32. 6 %, respectively in the present experiment. The flow condition covered extensive region of bubbly <b>flow,</b> <b>cap</b> turbulent flow {{as well as their}} transition. The extensive analysis on the radial profiles of local flow parameters and their axial developments demonstrate the development of interfacial structures along the flow direction due to the bubble coalescence and breakup and the gas expansion. The significant decrease in void faction and interfacial area concentration and the increase in Sauter mean diameter and interfacial velocity were observed when the gradual flow regime transition occurred. Finally, the net change in the interfacial area concentration due to the bubble coalescence and breakup was quantitatively investigated in the present paper to reflect the true transfer mechanisms in observed two-phase flows...|$|E

40|$|Because of its {{long-lived}} (Late Miocene to Pleistocene) post-subduction {{volcanic activity}} and location, the San Borja volcanic field (SBVF) {{is a key}} area for understanding the physical mechanisms controlling the spatial distribution of post-subduction volcanism on the Peninsula of Baja California. In this paper, we study the distribution and general characteristics of individual eruptive centers in the SBVF, aiming to {{provide insight into the}} changing physical nature of post-subduction magmatism and the control on vent location in a very unique tectonic setting. Volcanic activity has built more than 227 high-magnesium andesites (HMA) monogenetic scoria cones and thick lava <b>flows</b> <b>capping</b> large mesas during the last 12. 5 Ma. The average (mean) eruptive center in the SBVF has a height of 85 m, a basal diameter of 452 m and a slope angle of 30 °. Our volcanic alignment analysis of this field is based on field data, satellite images, and a quantitative method for detecting volcanic center alignments. The morphologic data, together with new ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar geochronology data have been used to refine our alignment analysis and to better delineate the temporal evolution of post-subduction volcanic activity in this field. The available ages vary from 3. 53 ± 0. 18 to 10 ± 0. 23 Ma suggesting that the long-lived HMA volcanism occurred almost continuously (with some concentration of pulses) throughout Late Miocene and extending to the Pleistocene and even into the Quaternary, replacing the arc-related activity of the Comondú arc which vanished in this area around 12. 5 Ma. Alignment analysis confirms a NW-SE direction as the preferred orientation of volcanic alignments and shows that vent elongations do not display a strong parallelism in any particular direction, marking the absence of matches between lineaments defined by multiple vents and orientations of vent elongation. The results of the volcanic alignment analysis allowed us to infer the direction of the maximum instantaneous extension (S 1 _local) at SBVF from Late Miocene to Quaternary. We compared this value to the direction of maximum instantaneous extension for the Baja California Peninsula at a regional scale (S 1 _regional), which can be estimated from regional tectonic reconstruction. The comparison of S 1 _regional and S 1 _local allows us to quantify the influence of tectonic stresses in controlling the localization of monogenetic volcanism at the SBVF. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The uplifted {{and deeply}} eroded {{volcanic}} succession of Porto Santo (central East-Atlantic) {{is the product}} of a wide spectrum of dynamic processes that are active in shoaling to emergent seamounts. Two superimposed lapilli cones marking the base of the exposed section are interpreted as having formed from numerous submarine to subaerial phreatomagmatic explosions, pyroclastic fragmentation being subordinate. The lower basaltic and the upper mugearitic to trachytic sections are dominated by redeposited tephra and are called 'lapilli cone aprons'. Vertical growth due to accumulation of tephra, voluminous intrusions, and minor pillowed lava flows produced ephemeral islands which were subsequently leveled by wave erosion, as shown by conglomerate beds. Periods of volcanic quiescence are represented by abundant biocalcarenite lenses at several stratigraphic levels. The loose tephra piles became stabilized by widespread syn-volcanic intrusions such as dikes and trachytic to rhyolitic domes welding the volcanic and volcaniclastic ensemble into a solid edifice. Shattering of a submarine extrusive trachytic dome by pyroclastic and phreatomagmatic explosions, accentuated by quench fragmentation, resulted in pumice- and crystal-rich deposits emplaced in a prominent submarine erosional channel. The dome must have produced an island as indicated by a collapse breccia comprising surf-rounded boulders of dome material. Subaerial explosive activity is represented by scoria cones and tuff cones. Basaltic lava flows built a resistant cap that protected the island from wave erosion. Some lava flows entered the sea and formed two distinct types of lava delta: 1. closely-packed pillow lava and massive tabular lava flows along the southwestern coast of Porto Santo, and 2. a steeply inclined pillow-hyaloclastite breccia prism composed of foreset-bedded hydroclastic breccia, variably-shaped pillows, and thin sheet <b>flows</b> <b>capped</b> by subhorizontal submarine to subaerial lava flows along the eastern coast of Porto Santo. The facies architectures indicate emplacement: 1. on a gently sloping platform in southwestern Porto Santo, and 2. on steep offshore slopes along high energy shorelines in eastern Porto Santo. Growth of the pillow-hyaloclastite breccia prism is dominated by the formation of foreset beds but various types of syn-volcanic intrusions contributed significantly. Submarine flank eruptions occurred in very shallow water on the flanks of the hyaloclastite prism in eastern Porto Santo. The island became consolidated by intrusion of numerous dikes and by emplacement of prominent intrusions that penetrate the entire volcanic succession.
