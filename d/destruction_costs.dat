With the aid of these analyses, the potentials for improving the thermodynamic efficiency and for reducing the overall cost and the overall environmental impact are revealed. The objectives of this paper are to demonstrate (a) the potential for generating electricity while regasifying LNG and (b) some of the capabilities associated with advanced exergy-based methods.

40|$|Network {{disconnection}} {{problems are}} defined from a network attacker's point of view. In a centralized network where flows are supplied {{from a source}} node to the other nodes, called demand nodes, a network attacker aims to block the supply to demand nodes by destroying edges. As destroying edges incurs expenses, an attacker considers the following three different strategies. The first problem, denoted by (NDP 1), is to maximize the unsatisfied flow demands while keeping {{the total cost of}} destroying the edges no more than a given budget. The second problem, denoted by (NDP 2), is to minimize the edge <b>destruction</b> <b>cost</b> needed to make a certain amount of demand unsatisfied. The last problem, denoted by (NDP 3), is to minimize the ratio of the edge <b>destruction</b> <b>cost</b> to the unsatisfied demand. In this paper, we derive the properties of the optimal solutions for the above three problems and show that the last one and the linear programming relaxations of the first two ones can be solved in a strongly polynomial time by using a parametric network flow algorithm.

As such, they are independent of the dismissed worker's skill level. We establish that, for young workers, unemployment incidence increases with skill in high-firing-tax countries, while the opposite holds in economies with low firing taxes. The model is able to replicate these observations, while maintaining unemployment duration and the unemployment rate as decreasing functions of skill in all countries. Because of constant firing taxes, the effective tax rate diminishes with skill. Hence, the size of job <b>destruction</b> <b>costs</b> decreases with skill. Also, high-skill vacancies are more profitable, implying tighter markets. These two reasons generate the skill-incidence pattern.

40|$|Exergoeconomic {{analysis}} of {{a nuclear power plant}} is a focus of this dissertation. Specifically, the performance of the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in Arizona is examined. The analysis combines thermodynamic second law exergy analysis with economics in order to assign costs to the loss and destruction of exergy. This work was done entirely with an interacting spreadsheets notebook. The procedures are to first determine conventional energy flow, where the thermodynamic stream state points are calculated automatically. Exergy flow is then evaluated along with destruction and losses. The capital cost and fixed investment rate used for the economics do not apply specifically to the Palo Verde Plant. Exergy costing is done next involving the solution of about 90 equations by matrix inversion. Finally, the analysis assigns cost to the exergy destruction and losses in each component. In this work, the cost of electricity (exergy), including capital cost, leaving the generator came to 38, 400 $/hr. The major exergy destruction occurs in the reactor where fission energy transfer is limited by the maximum permissible clad temperature. Exergy <b>destruction</b> <b>costs</b> were: reactor [...] 18, 207 $/hr, the low pressure turbine [...] 2, 000 $/hr, the condenser [...] 1, 700 $/hr, the steam generator [...] 1, 200 $/hr. The inclusion of capital cost and O&M are important in new system design assessments. When investigating operational performance, however, these are sunk costs; only fuel cost needs to be considered. The application of a case study is included based on a real modification instituted at Palo Verde to reduce corrosion steam generator problems; the pressure in the steam generator was reduced from 1072 to 980 psi. Exergy <b>destruction</b> <b>costs</b> increased in the low pressure turbine and in the steam generator, but decreased in the reactor vessel and the condenser.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal production lot size decisions for clinical trial supply chains. One unique aspect of clinical trial supply chains {{is the risk}} of failure, meaning that the investigational drug is proven unsafe or ineffective during human testing and the trial is halted. Upon failure, any unused inventory is essentially wasted {{and needs to be}} destroyed. To avoid waste, manufacturers could produce small lot sizes. However, high production setup costs lead manufacturers to opt for large lot sizes and few setups. To optimally balance this tradeoff of waste and destruction versus production inefficiency, this paper generalizes the Wagner-Whitin model (W-W model) to incorporate the risk of failure. We show that this stochastic model, referred to as the failure-risk model, is equivalent to the deterministic W-W model if one adjusts the cost parameters properly to reflect failure and <b>destruction</b> <b>costs.</b> We find that increasing failure rates lead to reduced lot sizes and that properly incorporating the risk of failure into clinical trial drug production can lead to substantial cost savings as compared to the W-W model without the properly adjusted parameters. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{production and}} inventory decisions made within clinical trial supply chains {{in order to}} reduce drug supply costs. By investigating the SEC filings of public companies, we find that drug supply costs frequently account for a significant portion of pharmaceutical companies ’ R&D spending. To unlock value tied up in clinical trial supply chains, three unique aspects of clinical trial supply chains are explored and associated supply chain decisions are optimized. The first unique factor that differentiates the supply chains for clinical trials is the risk of failure, meaning that the investigational drug is proven unsafe or ineffective during human testing. Upon failure, any unused inventory is essentially wasted and needs to be destroyed. We ex-plore the effect of this failure on production planning decisions and find the planner’s decision to be a balancing act between waste and <b>destruction</b> <b>costs</b> versus production inefficiency.

40|$|Significant coastal {{vulnerability}} (CV) in the United Kingdom (UK) endangers {{the population and}} the infrastructure and distorts the national economy, yet present and proposed literature only quotes previous circumstances that failed to deliver factual fiscal assessment. The current estimate models for {{coastal vulnerability}} are useful for decision-making in some magnitudes, but coastal vulnerability models need to be extended to comprise a wider choice of economic effects. These are real problems {{that need to be}} addressed for an estimation of fiscal coastal vulnerability with novel models of science and economics to limit <b>destruction</b> <b>costs</b> or spend with greater resilience. To address the current research gap, this study appraised coastal vulnerability by establishing an innovative model: a Fiscal Coastal Vulnerability Index (FCVI) with fiscal parameters by 2 Path analysis (2 PA). It identifies the coastal vulnerability hotspots in Path One (P 1) and develops an FCVI and GIS maps in Path Two (P 2). Primary results revealed that 11 sites across the UK (seven in England, three in Wales, and one in Scotland) were identified as fiscally vulnerable coastal areas. Identified sites currently contain £ 22. 36 billion worth of coastal vulnerability, and > 100, 000 people are at high risk of flooding, erosion, storm surge, and high winds. The Fiscal Coastal Vulnerability Index can be adapted depending on kind of coastal environment and used as a planning tool to establish economic susceptibility.

The ORC configurations studied are: a simple organic Rankine cycle (SORC), an ORC with an internal heat exchanger (HORC) and a regenerative organic Rankine cycle (RORC). Exergoeconomic analyses are performed with the specific exergy costing (SPECO) method. First, energy and exergy analyses are applied to the combined cycles. Then, a cost-balance, as well as auxiliary equations are developed for the components to determine the exergoeconomic parameters for the combined cycles and their components. The three combined cycles are compared considering the same operating conditions for the GT-MHR cycle, and a parametric study is done to reveal the effects on the exergoeconomic performance of the combined cycles of various significant parameters, e. g., turbine inlet and evaporator temperatures and compressor pressure ratio.

The carbon productivity concept is a cause of production increase that offset production decrease factor depending on green-house gas reduction. The potential environment pollution index presents the possibility of environment pollution through construction phase. The carbon productivity is ‘Construction cost/Carbon emission’.

The selected case study, a Community Centre located in London, underwent a deep-energy retrofit in 2011, becoming the first ‘non-domestic Passivhaus’ retrofit in the country. As the building was retrofitted per Passivhaus standards, which is based solely on First Law analysis, a thermodynamic investigation can provide a novel means by which to assess its exergy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As such, {{the aim of this}} paper is to conduct a comprehensive exergy and exergoeconomic analysis, presenting novel performance indicators for the pre-retrofit and post-retrofit Passivhaus building. First law outputs show that the improvement presents high levels of energy savings (75. 6 %), reductions in carbon emissions (64. 5 %), and occupant thermal comfort improvement (28. 8 %). Second law outputs present a reduction in primary exergy input reduction of 56. 4 % and exergy destructions of 60. 4 %, leading to improve building exergy efficiency from 9. 8 % to 18. 0 %. Nevertheless, exergoeconomically the building did not perform as expected due to high capital <b>cost</b> and exergy <b>destructions</b> <b>cost</b> rates.

Both active and passive technologies were analysed using two calibrated archetype non-domestic buildings as case studies (an office and a primary school). A novel cost-benefit indicator which accounts for building exergy <b>destruction</b> <b>cost,</b> retrofit annual capital cost, and project annual revenue is presented.

The {{objective is to}} ascertain how the variant in the intercooler effectiveness affects the exergy-based parameters.

The considered cycles include: the non-specific cycle (Case 1) comprising a gas turbine (GT), intercooler (IC), heat exchanger (HE) and reheat system (REH), others include (GT+H+REH +ST, Case 2), (GT+HE +IC +REH +ST+FWH, Case 3) and (GT+HE+IC+REH +ST+ 2 FWH, Case 4). The calculated cycle efficiencies (Cases 1 – 4) varies from 17. 59 % to 28. 84 % for intercooler effectiveness of 0. 75 and 0. 95. The exergy destruction within this range was 0. 97 %, 1. 26 %, 0. 89 % and 1. 23 % (Cases 1, 2 3 and 4) respectively.

Livestock exhibitions provide an opportunity for animal diseases to spread by convening large numbers of animals from geographically disperse areas, comingling these animals at the exhibition site, and subsequently dispersing them to potentially be comingled with commercial animals making livestock exhibitions a crucial part of livestock traceability. ^ The purpose of this research is to identify the potential for disease spread originating at livestock exhibitions and to identify the economic value of alternative measures to prevent or control a disease outbreak. Specifically, this research addresses the issues in the context of potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease and pseudorabies originating from the Indiana State Fair. The North American Animal Disease Spread Model is utilized to simulate hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease and pseudorabies outbreaks affecting the cattle and swine industries in a three county region in West Central Indiana under alternative policies aimed at containing the disease events. ^ Results indicated that exhibition animals that have been exposed to PRV or FMD at the state fair and return to the home farm would devastate commercial animal agriculture in that region. Resulting disease outbreaks would result in the destruction {{of the majority of the}} animals in the three county area. Additionally, results indicated that changes within a range of traceability levels for small cattle and swine farms resulted in less than a 2 % change in the number of animal destroyed in this region. This is primarily due to the small sample sized used in this research. However, these results suggest that policies which prevent or control the disease outbreak along with improving animal traceability should be implemented. The expected economic benefits of policies analyzed in this research are determined based on a range of probabilities of a disease outbreak occurring.

Constructing roads into relatively pristine areas, however, has the expected effect of increasing agricultural land use and the rate of deforestation. Furthermore, our out of sample model evaluation exercises suggested that changes in land clearing tend to precede, rather than follow, changes in transport costs.
