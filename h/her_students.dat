5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with <b>her</b> <b>students,</b> to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of <b>her</b> <b>students</b> {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with her}} {{dedication}} to <b>her</b> <b>students,</b> the University of Siegen houses its mathematics and physics departments in {{buildings on the}} Emmy Noether Campus.|$|E

5000|$|Mary Kay Fualaau (daughter): famously {{arrested for}} raping (and being {{impregnated}} by) <b>her</b> 12-year-old <b>student</b> while employed as his teacher. While on probation and forbidden to contact <b>her</b> former <b>student,</b> was again arrested after being found raping <b>her</b> former <b>student</b> {{in a car}} (and impregnated with her second child by <b>her</b> former <b>student).</b> Upon release from prison, she later married him.|$|R
5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because <b>her</b> <b>students</b> were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching <b>her</b> <b>students</b> if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that <b>her</b> <b>students</b> liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Eddy became {{close to}} another of <b>her</b> <b>students,</b> Ebenezer Johnson Foster, a homeopath and {{graduate}} of the Hahnemann Medical College. He was 41 and she was 67, but apparently in need of affection and loyalty she adopted him legally in November that year, and he {{changed his name to}} Ebenezer Johnson Foster Eddy.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{showed a}} devotion to her subject and <b>her</b> <b>students</b> that {{extended}} beyond the academic day. Once, when {{the building was}} closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their {{plans for the future}} and mathematical concepts.|$|E

5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from <b>her</b> <b>students.</b> Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{teaching}} music at Hull House, Smith {{served as the}} choral director. She also composed songs and arranged music specifically for <b>her</b> <b>students</b> to perform. She initiated an annual Christmas concert which also included a dramatic presentation and was eagerly anticipated by the neighborhood for its holiday pageantry. Under her direction of the music school, the Hull House Boy's Band developed, which included immigrant boys from the neighborhood who would later become noted jazz performers. Jazz pianist Art Hodes recalled {{that one of the}} first jam sessions he ever had occurred when a young clarinetist named Benny Goodman joined the Boy's Band. James Petrillo, who would later become the leader of the musician's union, the American Federation of Musicians, was {{also a member of the}} group.|$|E
5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left alone, the Christian Science message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and <b>her</b> <b>students</b> taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|During Levy's tenure, {{the synagogue}} had several congregants who were famous, or would become so. Ray Frank, the first Jewish woman to preach {{formally}} from a pulpit in the United States, settled in Oakland around 1885, and taught Hebrew Bible studies and Jewish history at First Hebrew Congregation's Sabbath school, {{where she was}} superintendent. <b>Her</b> <b>students</b> there in the 1880s included Gertrude Stein, later to become a famous writer, and Judah Leon Magnes, who would become a prominent Reform rabbi. Magnes's views of the Jewish people were strongly influenced by First Hebrew's Rabbi Levy, {{and it was at}} the building on 13th and Clay that Magnes first began preaching—his bar mitzvah speech of 1890 was quoted at length in The Oakland Tribune.|$|E
5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and <b>her</b> <b>students.</b> In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5|$|Eddy copyrighted her book, {{then called}} The Science of Life, in July 1874. Three of <b>her</b> <b>students,</b> George Barry, Elizabeth Newhall and Daniel Spofford, paid a Boston printer, W. F. Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce the}} first edition. The printer began work in September 1874, but stopped {{whenever}} the advance payment ran out, so progress was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E

5|$|In April 10, 2015 Marylin Zuniga, {{a teacher}} at Forest Street Elementary School in Orange, New Jersey, was {{suspended}} without pay after asking <b>her</b> <b>students</b> to write letters to Abu-Jamal, who fell ill in prison due to complications from diabetes, without approval from the school or parents. Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. On the other hand, community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed their support and condemned Zuniga's suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others signed a letter calling for her immediate reinstatement. On May 13, 2015 The Orange Preparatory Academy board voted to dismiss Marylin Zuniga after hearing from her and several of her supporters.|$|E
5|$|Kate is {{surprised}} {{the next day}} when she is thrown a baby shower by her colleagues. She reconciles with Dave, putting his comments behind them. At home, Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie's sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and <b>her</b> <b>students</b> accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell was {{a member}} of the {{international}} arts group Société Anonyme and was asked by artist and patron Katherine Dreier to be on its board of directors in 1928. Lazzell later joined the New York Society of Women Artists and the Society of Independent Artists. Lazzell began incorporating abstract designs into her woodblocks and created designs for hooked rugs toward the end of the decade. She returned to Morgantown in the winter of 1929 and offered art lessons. Among <b>her</b> <b>students</b> was Ella Sophonisba Hergesheimer.|$|E

5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with <b>her</b> <b>students,</b> Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home economics principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that <b>her</b> <b>students</b> were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting <b>her</b> <b>students</b> to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E
30|$|Instrumental and socioemotional {{mentoring}} {{are typically}} conceptualized as positive mentoring behaviors. As with most meaningful relationships, however, mentoring relationships {{can also have}} difficult moments (see Wood and Duck 1995). Negative mentoring occurs when the mentor engages in practices that undermine the mentoring bond (Eby et al. 2010; Eby et al. 2000). For instance, a mentor who routinely cancels meetings with <b>her</b> <b>student</b> or makes demeaning remarks about <b>her</b> <b>student’s</b> work is engaged in negative mentoring.|$|R
