5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so the search is narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that someone close to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) {{but they are not}} the culprits. They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst <b>Helen</b> <b>was</b> on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a conversation about her father.|$|E

In June 1972, Itasca County notified Bryan that the mobile home was subject to US$147.95 in taxes. The Bryans could not afford to pay the tax, and contacted the Leech Lake Reservation Legal Services Project (Legal Services) for help, noting that the mobile home was on Indian land.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone <b>Helen</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to bring gale-force winds to Darwin, Australia since 1985. The fourth named storm of the 2007–08 Australian region cyclone season, Helen developed {{out of a}} weak {{area of low pressure}} in late December over the Top End region of Australia. Generally tracking westward, the system eventually intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given the name Helen on 2January. By this time, it was situated over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and was beginning to retrograde eastward. Late on 4January, the storm made landfall near Channel Point with winds of 95km/h (60mph) though rapidly weakened to a tropical low within 12hours. Gradually accelerating, the remnants of Helen moved over the Gulf of Carpentaria before striking land again on 6January. The system was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula on 7January.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon <b>Helen</b> <b>was</b> {{the most}} {{destructive}} tropical cyclone to strike Japan during the 1972 Pacific typhoon season. Originating from a tropical disturbance on September11 near the Northern Mariana Islands, Helen gradually intensified {{as it moved}} northwestward. By September14, it reached typhoon strength and soon turned northeast towards Japan. Accelerating due to a trough over the East China Sea, Helen rapidly approached the country and made landfall near Cape Kushimoto as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, a weakened Helen emerged into the Sea of Japan. After merging with an upper-level low, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19 and was last noted two days later after moving through southern Hokkaido.|$|E
