5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E

500|$|Carlos Mencia, host of {{the former}} Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, is portrayed in [...] "Fishsticks" [...] as knowingly {{stealing}} credit for a joke he did not write; this is a reference to accusations other comedians <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people. Mencia's death scene in the episode, {{as well as his}} claims that he uses a catheter to relieve himself, are a reference to Lalin, a character who uses a wheelchair in the 1993 crime film Carlito's Way.|$|E

500|$|Seward {{accompanied}} Lincoln to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in November 1863, where Lincoln was {{to deliver}} a short speech, that would become famous as the Gettysburg Address. [...] The night before the speech, Lincoln met with Seward. There is no surviving evidence that Seward authored any changes: he stated after the address, when asked if had had any hand in it, that only Lincoln could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> speech. Seward also proposed to Lincoln that he proclaim a day of national thanksgiving, and drafted a proclamation to that effect. [...] Although post-harvest thanksgiving celebrations had long been held, this first formalized Thanksgiving Day as a national observance.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Eric Goldman {{praised the}} performances of John Slattery and Peyton List, and said the episode [...] "took three of the show's best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways, telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving, and delivering one of the show's best episodes ever in the process. This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E

It hurts my {{feelings}} but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. The blog post drew substantial media attention; Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, but in the end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego." [...] Carlos Mencia, host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, was also spoofed in [...] "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people.

500|$|The Volunteers {{started at}} their 27-yard line {{to begin the}} drive, but went three and out and punted back to the Hokies without gaining a first down. The kick was {{returned}} to the Tech 39-yard line, where the Hokies' offense started with 31 seconds remaining in the quarter. On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> catch, we could have gotten back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a lot out of us." [...] After Still's dropped pass, DeShazo threw two incomplete passes and Virginia Tech punted back to Tennessee. The kick was caught by near the Tennessee 10-yard line, and returned {{all the way to the}} Virginia Tech 37-yard line. At the end of the third quarter, Tennessee still led, 3516.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} track features sharp {{criticism by}} Scott-Heron of then-US president Richard Nixon and his vice-president Spiro Agnew, among other politicians {{involved in the}} scandal; the Watergate incident had yet to reach its conclusion when the song was recorded. Scott-Heron introduces the song with a short speech discussing the blues and referencing current events: [...] "But lately we had Frank Rizzo with the 'Lie Detector Blues'/We done had the United States government talkin bout the 'Energy Crisis Blues'". The final chorus line directly references Nixon and the scandal: [...] "And {{there are those who}} swear that've seen King Richard/Beneath that cesspool–Watergate". His lyrics range from humor to critical diatribes of political corruption and social issues. It shares lyrical similarities to Stevie Wonder's anti-Nixon song [...] "You Haven't Done Nothin'" [...] (1974). The album concludes with a reprisal of the opening track. Music writer Karl Keely said of its significance, [...] "The return of the refrain from 'Peace Go with You Brother' adds a sense of wholeness to end the record, an idea that the album has travelled through Gil Scott-Heron's worries, fears, pleasures, hopes, and finally, his pronounced disliking of Richard Nixon, before returning to the opening statement, in the hopes that the record may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> selfish brother think more about his world and those in it, instead of moving along in a self-imposed bubble." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2001, The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that Manchester United was planning an [...] "audacious" [...] attempt to sign Vieira; manager Sir Alex Ferguson, a long-term admirer of the player, {{was given the}} green light by his board to make a bid. In the summer period, Vieira disparaged Arsenal's transfer activity and was adamant the club would not finish [...] "in the top five in the league – and forget the Champions League," [...] saying about his future: [...] "As far as I'm concerned, the matter is resolved. I am leaving Arsenal and I <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> perfectly clear." [...] The club refused to respond to his comments, but vice-chairman David Dein was privately irked at Vieira's agent, Marc Roger, for letting the situation become unsettling. Wenger attributed the saga {{at the hands of}} Manchester United: [...] " [...] made an approach to Patrick without contacting us, and that does not really respect the rules." [...] Vieira turned up for pre-season training in July 2001 as normal and was later named the club vice-captain, to ensure he would succeed Tony Adams as captain. Success finally came for Vieira in the 2001–02 season; Arsenal regained the league and beat Chelsea in the 2002 FA Cup Final to complete a second double.|$|E
2500|$|Randwick then {{defeated}} Melrose in the semi-final 16-15. Campese {{opened the}} scoring of the semi-final with a try that he converted to give Randwick a 6-0 lead. The scores were level at halftime 6-6. Campese scored first for Randwick {{in the second}} half with a try that he again converted to make the score 12-6. However, Melrose leveled the scores again, and with two minutes remaining Melrose captain Craig Chalmers kicked a penalty goal for a 15-12 lead. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that, “Randwick looked briefly flustered but Campese, skipping through on a 30m run, rescued the game with 60 seconds remaining, to send the Australians through 16-15.” Graham Law in The Scotsman reported on the final moments of the semi-final and wrote that, [...] "Randwick secured ball from the kick-off and when Melrose infringed at a ruck full-time had been reached but, correctly, referee Jim Fleming allowed play to continue and Walker released Campese from nearly halfway. Chalmers, with the first engagement, and Purves both made tackles but Campese, now domiciled in Italy, seemed to expand and aquaplaned to the goal-line. It was no-side and Keith Robertson’s men were out. The Sunday Herald of Scotland wrote that, [...] "No-one else in the tournament would have had the pace and verve to squeeze in at the right corner to deny the hosts..." [...] Following the tournament Campese admitted that, ““If it had not been wet, I would not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> try against Melrose.” ...|$|E
