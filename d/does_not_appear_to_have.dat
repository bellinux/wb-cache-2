The cinema was designed by Alastair Macdonald, son of the Prime Minister Ramsay, and was in operation from 1933 until being demolished in 1981.

5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E

Victoria <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E

The marriage <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, {{there is no evidence of}} a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April 1345, he {{was granted}} a canonry in the diocese of Dunkeld with {{expectation}} of a prebend, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> obtained this in practice, although he did obtain a different Dunkeld canonry with prebend on 12 May 1352. This he retained until his consecration as Bishop of Dunblane in 1361. Walter also obtained a fourth prebend in this period. He had been pursuing a benefice in the diocese of St Andrews, {{and while he was}} granted this on 28 March 1351, the grant was still not effective by 16 April 1353, when he {{was granted a}} prebend in the diocese of Moray instead. This was not effective either, but Walter did eventually obtain a St Andrews diocese benefice, namely the church of Inverarity in Angus, which had become vacant on the death of its incumbent, William de Coventre, probably Walter's older brother. On 7 December 1345, Walter was appointed (provided) as Archdeacon of Dunblane, his most substantial benefice to date, but the appointment <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been carried through.|$|E
5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated {{about a man who}} plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been extant in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a legatus legionis (who had {{an officer}} staff of 6 tribuni militum and one praefectus castrorum), an {{auxiliary}} praefectus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed {{the support of}} purely staff officers. The possible exception is an attested beneficiarius ("deputy"), {{who may have been}} the praefectus' second-in-command, if this title was a regular rank and not simply an ad hoc appointment for a specific task. Also attached to the praefectus were the regiment's vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole unit) and cornucen (horn-blower).|$|E

5|$|Cubitt's eldest brother, Bertram Blakiston (b. 1862), {{attended}} Balliol College, Oxford {{before entering}} the civil service; he would later serve as the private secretary to the Conservative politicians Edward Stanhope, Secretary of State for War, in 1890-91, and St John Brodrick, Under-Secretary of State for War, in 1896-98. He was knighted in 1920. The middle brother, Julian Francis (b. 1869) studied at Selwyn College, Cambridge, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had an active public career. Their one sister, Helen, married a German economist, Dr. Moritz Julius Bonn, in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal {{and largely}} solitary, the banded houndshark preys on benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. After mating during summer, females bear {{as many as}} 42 pups following a gestation period of 9–12 months. The banded houndshark poses no danger to humans and adapts well to captivity. It is caught as bycatch off Japan, Taiwan, and likely elsewhere in its range; it may be eaten but is not as well-regarded as related species. Because fishing <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diminished this shark's population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E
