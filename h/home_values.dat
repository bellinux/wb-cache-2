25|$|In some cases, {{longtime}} black renters {{have been}} priced out of inner city neighborhoods because of rising rents caused by gentrification. Owners {{who want to}} move to smaller housing cannot afford it. In other cases, rising <b>home</b> <b>values</b> increase property tax assessments to a level which longtime homeowners cannot afford.|$|E

About 91% of the {{population}} has attained high school or higher, and there were 5,524 companies located in the city.|$|R
25|$|This wealth {{inequality}} {{is apparent}} in the share of assets held. In 2010, the top 5% wealthiest households had approximately 72% of the financial wealth, while the bottom 80% of households had 5%. Financial wealth is measured as net worth minus <b>home</b> <b>values,</b> meaning income-generating financial assets like stocks and bonds, plus business equity.|$|E
25|$|Nantucket is {{a tourist}} {{destination}} and summer colony. Due to tourists and seasonal residents, {{the population of}} the island increases to at least 50,000 during the summer months. In 2008, Forbes magazine cited Nantucket as having <b>home</b> <b>values</b> {{among the highest in the}} US. Home prices per square foot are considered much higher than those in the Hamptons on Long Island.|$|E
25|$|Among homeowners with {{household}} incomes {{in the top}} 10%, those {{earning more}} than $120,000 a year, <b>home</b> <b>values</b> were considerably higher while houses were larger and newer. The median value for homes in this demographic was $256,000 while median square footage was 2,500 and the median year of construction was 1977. The vast majority, 80%, had two or more bathrooms.

50|$|A {{homestead}} exemption is {{most often}} only on a fixed monetary amount, such as the first $50,000 of the assessed value. The remainder is taxed at the normal rate. In that case, a <b>home</b> <b>valued</b> at $150,000 would then only be taxed on $100,000; a <b>home</b> <b>valued</b> at $75,000 would be taxed only on $25,000.|$|R
25|$|The African-American {{population}} of Willingboro increased throughout the 1960s; by 1964 there were 50 African-American families. By 1970, African Americans represented about 11% of the population. During the early 1970s, several homeowners {{said they were}} approached by local real estate agents and told that their neighborhood was becoming increasingly African-American and <b>home</b> <b>values</b> could decline {{if they did not}} sell quickly; a practice known as blockbusting. While the Human Relations Council could not prove these claims, it made recommendations to help foster better relations between ethnic communities in the township and calm concerns.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1958, {{there were}} reports of an {{emerging}} lending crisis in Marshall Heights. Many homeowners in the neighborhood reported being unable to qualify for a mortgage or home repair loan, since their incomes were too low and the value of their homes practically nonexistent. Private developers were unable to purchase land, because title to parcels were murky. The lending crisis continued into 1960 and 1961. Low <b>home</b> <b>values</b> {{as well as a number}} of empty lots drew middle-class African Americans into Marshall Heights throughout the 1960s. By the late 1960s, the area had a substantial number of small businesses and retail establishments as well.|$|E
25|$|After a {{property}} revaluation {{was completed in}} 2013 and based on changes in tax levies by the municipality and the local school districts, the property tax rate increased by almost 50%, from $2.01 per $100 in assessed value in 2012 to $2.93 in 2013. A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that <b>home</b> <b>values</b> had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the revaluation complied with all state legal requirements.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{meltdown}} of {{the subprime}} mortgage industry in March 2007, Schumer proposed {{a federal government}} bailout of subprime borrowers {{in order to save}} homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring <b>home</b> <b>values.</b> As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer has pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to relocate from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.|$|E
500|$|The 2008–2012 global {{recession}} {{significantly affected}} the United States, with output still below potential {{according to the}} Congressional Budget Office.

2500|$|According to some, however, Greenspan's {{policies}} of adjusting {{interest rates to}} historic lows contributed to a housing bubble in the United States.
