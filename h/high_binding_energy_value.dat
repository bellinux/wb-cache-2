40|$|The {{charge state}} of Au {{nanoparticles}} deposited on MgO/Fe(001) ultrathin films {{has been investigated}} experimentally by means of X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy and theoretically by performing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The binding energy of the Au 4 f 7 / 2 core level peak has been studied {{as a function of}} the Au coverage and of the MgO film thickness. The Au 4 f 7 / 2 peak presents a <b>high</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> <b>value</b> (about 600 meV higher than bulk Au) for the smallest Au nanoparticles deposited on thick MgO films. The binding energy shift is only 200 meV for the very thin MgO films, indicating a different electronic configuration for the Au particles inthis case. For larger Au coverages the binding energy of the Au 4 f 7 / 2 peak converges to the bulk value for both thick and thin MgO films. In view of the results from DFT calculations, we show that this behavior is consistent with the occurrence of a charge flow from the MgO/Fe(001) interface to the Au nanoparticles. We also show that on ultrathin MgO films, the Au 4 f 7 / 2 photoemission linewidth is much sharper than for thicker oxide films, a result which is rationalized based on the different growth mode of Au nanoclusters when a charge transfer process takes place...|$|E

40|$|Tetra(4 -carboxyphenyl) {{porphyrin}} (TCPP) adsorbs strongly onto nanoparticulate TiO 2 {{and serves}} as an efficient photosensitizer for solar-energy conversion by TCPP-sensitized TiO 2 electrodes. Nanoparticulate TiO 2 electrodes were prepared from Degussa P 25 TiO 2 powder in the standard manner for a Grätzel cell. Adsorption studies of TCPP onto these sintered TiO 2 electrodes gave a saturation surface coverage of 47 ímol/g. Adsorption studies of TCPP onto colloidal dispersions of Degussa P 25 in ethanol gave a saturation surface coverage of 77 ímol/g. The difference between the saturation coverages is attributed to {{the reduction of the}} available surface area in the TiO 2 films after sintering, from 55 m 2 /g as a free colloid to about 34 m 2 /g as a sintered electrode. The nature of the binding of TCPP onto the TiO 2 electrodes was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (RRS). In the XPS spectra of TiO 2 with adsorbed TCPP, the O (1 s) and Ti (2 p 3 / 2) peaks of TiO 2 were shifted to a <b>higher</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> <b>value,</b> by about 0. 3 eV, and the O (1 s) and N (1 s) peaks of TCPP were shifted to a <b>higher</b> <b>binding</b> <b>energy,</b> by about 0. 7 eV. Upon adsorption of TCPP, one of the Ti (2 p 3 / 2) peaks of TiO 2 disappeared, suggesting complexation and removal of surface states.
