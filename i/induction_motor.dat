5|$|In {{order to}} avoid its {{dependence}} on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> that is lighter and more efficient than the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric cars in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials. The Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S use a similar motor.|$|E
5|$|Tesla also {{explained}} {{the principles of}} the rotating magnetic field in an <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end, using a device that he constructed known as the Egg of Columbus and introduced his new steam powered oscillator AC generator.|$|E

Chess grandmaster, Nigel Short grew up in Atherton and attended St Philip's School. Architect Arthur John Hope (1875–1960), a partner in Bradshaw Gass & Hope was born and lived in Atherton. Edward Ormerod, mining engineer at Gib Field Colliery, invented the Ormerod detaching hook, an important mining safety device.|$|E

Single-phase <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> are used extensively for smaller loads, such as household appliances like fans.

VFDs offer especially important energy savings opportunities for existing and prospective <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> in variable-torque centrifugal fan, pump and compressor load applications. Squirrel cage <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> are very widely used in both fixed-speed and variable-frequency drive (VFD) applications.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the master’s thesis dealing with the {{increasing}} efficiency of <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> there are briefly presented basic information about <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> followed by an overview of the losses of <b>induction</b> <b>motors.</b> The next part deals with the ways to increase efficiency of <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> without increasing tooling costs. The practical part consists of four measurements of four <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> with their various mechanical adjustments to make comparing benefits of these modifications possible. The measured results are compared by a finite element method in Maxwell 2 D Design program, in which the same motors are simulated as measured. Theoretical knowledge about the increase of efficiency is practically applied while being implemented in the simulations...|$|R

5|$|In July 1888, Brown and Peck {{negotiated}} a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> and transformer designs for $60,000 {{in cash and}} stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($ in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.|$|E
5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>motors</b> may {{be further}} divided into Squirrel Cage <b>Induction</b> <b>Motors</b> and Wound Rotor <b>Induction</b> <b>Motors.</b> SCIMs have a heavy winding {{made up of}} solid bars, usually {{aluminum}} or copper, joined by rings {{at the ends of}} the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.|$|R

50|$|Despite their name, not all linear <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> produce linear motion; some linear <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> are {{employed}} for generating rotations of large diameters where {{the use of}} a continuous primary would be very expensive.|$|R
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5|$|The AC {{electric}} motor {{used in a}} VFD system is usually three-phase <b>induction</b> <b>motor.</b> Some types of single-phase motors or synchronous motors advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase induction motors are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E
25|$|An <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> is an {{asynchronous}} AC motor where {{power is}} transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E

25|$|The <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> Tesla {{patented}} in the U.S. {{is considered}} {{to have been an}} independent invention since the Europe Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris published a paper on a rotating magnetic field based <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> on 11 March 1888, almost two months before Tesla was granted his patent.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{starting}} performance of squirrel-cage <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> the so-called 'skin effect' becomes very serious, which causes a highly uneven distribution of rotor-bar currents. The corresponding conduction losses of {{the upper and lower}} portions of rotor bars create high thermal stress, which may damage the rotor bars, particularly at the junction of rotor bars and end-rings. Hence, it is important to predict the starting and operating characteristics of <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> more accurately for the purpose of ensuring the reliability of motor operation.

However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B.

40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>motors</b> are {{the most}} {{predominant}} motors used in the industry. They use two-thirds of the total electrical energy generated in the industrialized countries. Motors fail due to many reasons and many are rewound two or more times during their lifetimes. It is generally assumed that a rewound motor is not as efficient as the original motor. Precise estimation of efficiency of a refurbished motor or any existing motor is crucial in industries for energy savings, auditing and management. Full-load and partial load efficiency can be determined by using the dynamometer procedure which is a highly expensive way and available only in well-equipped laboratories. An inexpensive and easily applied procedure for efficiency estimation is therefore a target of researchers and engineers in the field. In this Ph. D. work, two novel methods for estimating repaired, refurbished, or any existing induction motors’ efficiency are proposed. The two methods (named Method A and Method B) require only a DC test (including temperature measurement), nameplate details, and RMS readings of no-load input power, input voltage, and input current. Experimental and field results of testing a total of 196 <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> by using Method A are presented {{and the degree of}} accuracy is shown by comparing the estimated efficiencies to the measured values. Method B was validated by testing 8 <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> with acceptable accuracy. To provide the necessary credits to the proposed techniques, an error analysis study is conducted to investigate the level of uncertainty through testing three <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> and the results of uncertainty of the direct measurements and no-load measurements using the proposed technique are declared. Derating is a necessary procedure to protect <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> from overheating which is the main reason of motor failures. The overheating is caused by operating <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> with unbalanced voltages, over or undervoltage, or harmonics rich power supplies. To derate a machine, its full-load efficiency with balanced undistorted voltages and with unbalanced or distorted voltages must be measured. In many situations in industry and due to critical processes, it is not allowed to interrupt induction machines operation. Hence, an in situ efficiency estimation technique is most required. In this thesis, three novel in situ efficiency estimation algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm is to estimate the full-load and partial loads efficiency of <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> operating with balanced undistorted voltages. The algorithm is validated by testing 30 <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> with acceptable accuracy. The second proposed algorithm is for full-load efficiency estimation of <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> operating with unbalanced voltages. The technique is evaluated by testing 2 <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> with different levels of voltage unbalance. The results showed an acceptable accuracy. The third proposed algorithm is for full-load efficiency estimation of <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> operating with distorted unbalanced voltages where the harmonics effect is added. The technique is evaluated by testing 2 <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> with different levels of voltage unbalance. The results showed an acceptable accuracy. The three novel algorithms are designed by using Genetic Algorithm, pre-tested data, and IEEE Method F 1 calculations...|$|R
