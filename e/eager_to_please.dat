5|$|The French Spaniel has a {{friendly}} and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient. It {{is not a}} naturally aggressive dog, is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> and thus can be trained easily. A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master, being typically a working dog. It has {{a high level of}} stamina and requires vigorous exercise.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please,</b> they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E

Yet there he sat, patiently conning the page again and again, stimulated by no boyish ambition, for he was the common jest and scoff even of the uncouth objects that congregated about him, but inspired by the one <b>eager</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>please</b> his solitary friend.|$|R
50|$|The King Shepherd is self-confident with a {{well-balanced}} {{personality and}} healthy nervous system. They should not exhibit any shyness or nervousness. They are extremely intelligent, easy <b>to</b> train and <b>eager</b> and faithful <b>to</b> <b>please</b> their owners. This breed makes a fine sheep-herder and working dog. They {{are also a}} naturally courageous guard and watchdog, showing courage, strength, and hardiness in their role of protector. They make very nice companions and are friendly to other animals and children.|$|R
25|$|Boston is {{a gentle}} breed that {{typically}} has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humour.

25|$|Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers {{are known}} to be very intelligent, curious, alert, outgoing, and high-energy dogs. They are affectionate, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please,</b> busy, and get along well with children. They are good family dogs, however during the {{decision}} process potential owners should be weary of the physical and mental commitment that is required in order to keep a Toller busy. Physical stimulation should be provided for these dogs each day since they may become destructive when they are not exercised enough or left alone for too long.|$|E
60|$|The two {{poisoned}} ones {{went over}} the side yesterday. Since then we have taken the census. Two men only have not appeared, and they are Bob, the fat and overgrown feebling youth, and, of all creatures, the Faun. It seems my fate that I had to destroy the Faun--the poor, tortured Faun, always willing and <b>eager,</b> ever desirous <b>to</b> <b>please.</b> There is a madness of ill luck in all this. Why couldn't the two dead men have been Charles Davis and Tony the Greek? Or Bert Rhine and Kid Twist? or Bombini and Andy Fay? Yes, and in my heart I know I should have felt better had it been Isaac Chantz and Arthur Deacon, or Nancy and Sundry Buyers, or Shorty and Larry.|$|R

25|$|In July 1695, {{the city}} of Namur, {{occupied}} for three years by the French, was besieged by William III of England, {{at the head of}} an allied army. After the death of the Duke of Luxembourg, the French army was led by the Duke of Villeroi, a mediocre strategist but close to the king. The king, irritated at the recent turn of events, urged Villeroi to destroy Bruges or Ghent in a surprise attack. Villeroi, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> the king, instead suggested that bombarding Brussels would have more of an effect in drawing the enemy to a place in which the French could attack them strategically.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{characteristics of the}} American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes {{it one of the}} most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.|$|E
25|$|Nathaniel Martin is an Anglican priest whom Maturin meets as a parson, a {{thin and}} shabby {{literary}} gentleman in The Ionian Mission. He shares Maturin's love {{of nature and}} lack of maritime knowledge. Martin has an unfortunate tendency to buy his knowledge of living creatures {{at the expense of}} personal injury, including the loss of an eye to an owl, but his knowledge of anatomy and former experience in stuffing birds make him an obvious choice for surgeon's mate under Stephen. Martin first serves as assistant to Maturin in Treason's Harbour (Chapter 4), when Martin stays too long on the Dromedary inspecting Maturin's new diving bell, purchased to inspect the sea bottom. One notable show of his skills is when Martin sutures Maturin's long cut on the forehead; he is with the Surprises for the entire Red Sea mission, but not taken aboard the Surprise once she is repaired. He serves in this capacity through several novels. He is assistant surgeon on the Surprise sailing as a privateer in The Letter of Marque. Later, Martin serves as Surprise's surgeon during Stephen's absence (Thirteen-Gun Salute and The Nutmeg of Consolation). Sailors, who normally consider churchmen unlucky on board a ship, are often prepared to accept him in this medical capacity, further comforting themselves with the mistaken belief that he is only aboard because he was defrocked for having an affair with his Bishop's wife (from The Letter of Marque), though by that time he is a solid married man. At first meeting, Martin is a young man (younger than Stephen) who is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> and to be pleased; these qualities, along with his interest in nature, slowly fade with time. Martin's career at sea ends in The Wine Dark Sea when he becomes too ill to sail after treating himself with strong medicines he did not need, mistaking salt sores for the pox, in guilt for his thoughts, not actions towards Clarissa Oakes on the previous voyage. His love of botanizing returns as Maturin begins treatment to restore him. Surprise arrives at Callao, a port in Peru, before Martin is recovered, and Maturin has work to do ashore in Peru. Martin heads home with Dr Geary on a merchantman, Three Graces. Aubrey has given two livings on his holdings to Martin.|$|E

[...] The {{companion}} trade paperback describes {{the conflict between}} PROXY's primary programming to kill Starkiller and its self-imposed desire to help him; PROXY is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> Starkiller, but {{does not know how}} dangerous it can be or that there is a conflict between its programming and Starkiller's wishes. Trying to avoid having PROXY's dialogue become too reminiscent of either C-3PO or the villainous HK-47 of Knights of the Old Republic, developers focused on PROXY's friendly naïvety.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{stereotypes}} {{of blacks in}} Uncle Tom's Cabin are the [...] "happy darky" [...] (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a [...] "noble hero". The stereotype {{of him as a}} [...] "subservient fool who bows down to the white man" [...] evidently resulted from staged [...] "Tom Shows", over which Stowe had no control.|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] itself {{received}} generally positive reviews; Pitchfork Media {{called it}} a [...] "stunning closer" [...] to Phantom Power, while PopMatters described the song as [...] "the kind of schizophrenic fun we've come to expect from the band but ... less showy and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please,</b> as they control themselves {{enough to make the}} jarring, contradicting styles much easier to digest". Stylus Magazine stated that the [...] "great" [...] track [...] "achieves symbiosis between techno and guitar-pop better than anything else they've done before". The BBC agreed calling [...] "Slow Life" [...] the band's [...] "most successful mindrattling techno attempt so far". The song was placed at number 46 in the 2003 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.|$|E
60|$|Running to see {{fireworks}} alone, rushing off {{to examine}} Bosjesmen by one's self, is a dreary work: I should think very few men {{would have the}} courage to do it unattended, and personally would not prefer a pipe in their own rooms. Hence if Clive went to see all these sights, as he did, it is to be concluded that he went in company; and if he went in company and sought it, we may suppose that little affair which annoyed him at Baden no longer tended to hurt his peace of mind very seriously. The truth is, our countrymen are pleasanter abroad than at home; most hospitable, kindly, and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> be <b>pleased</b> and <b>to</b> <b>please.</b> You see a family half a dozen times in a week in the little Roman circle, whom you shall not meet twice in a season afterwards in the enormous London round. When Easter is over and everybody is going away at Rome, you and your neighbour shake hands, sincerely sorry to part: in London we are obliged to dilute our kindness so that there is hardly any smack of the original milk. As one by one the pleasant families dropped off with whom Clive had spent his happy winter; as Admiral Freeman's carriage drove away, whose pretty girls he had caught at St. Peter's kissing St. Peter's toe; as Dick Denby's family ark appeared with all Denby's sweet young children kissing farewells to him out of the window; as those three charming Miss Baliols with whom he had that glorious day in the Catacombs; as friend after friend quitted the great city with kind greetings, warm pressures of the hand, and hopes of meeting in a yet greater city {{on the banks of the}} Thames, young Clive felt a depression of spirit. Rome was Rome, but it was pleasanter to see it in company; our painters are smoking still at the Oafs Greco, but a society all smoke and all painters did not suit him. If Mr. Clive is not a Michael Angelo or a Beethoven, if his genius is not gloomy, solitary, gigantic, shining alone, like a lighthouse, a storm round about him, and breakers dashing at his feet, I cannot help myself: he is as Heaven made him, brave, honest, gay, and friendly, and persons of a gloomy turn must not look to him as a hero.|$|R

500|$|The breed {{is highly}} affectionate, playful, {{extremely}} patient and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please.</b> [...] As such, dogs of the breed are good {{with children and}} other dogs. Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses {{with more than one}} breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{is often}} {{described}} by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or [...] "much in little" [...] or [...] "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> them. Pugs are playful and thrive on human companionship. They also {{tend to have a}} snoozy nature and {{spend a lot of time}} napping. Pugs are often called [...] "shadows" [...] because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action, craving attention and affection from their owners.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Dignity was generally positive. Metacritic gave the album a Metascore—a weighted average {{based on the}} impressions of a select 13 critical reviews—of 61, signifying generally favorable reviews. Rolling Stone gave a positive review of the album, feeling that Duff's attempt to make an adult-oriented dance-pop album was successful. About.com gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, called Duff [...] "as likeable as ever" [...] and praised the songwriting and production contributions of Richard Vission and will.i.am. Allmusic noted that the album was firmly based on [...] "sturdy, hooky, and memorable" [...] songwriting. The review claimed similarities between Dignity and Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), noting that Duff was musically fashionable but not a trendsetter. At the same time, the review criticized Duff's thin vocals, calling them [...] "not at all like a woman". Billboard called Duff's decision to make a dance-pop album daring, considering the unpopularity of the genre at the time. The review continued, [...] "It's practically something straight out of the United Kingdom for all of its poppy goodness." [...] Entertainment Weekly noted that Duff's break-up with Madden brought out her personality, which the magazine felt was lacking in her previous work. [...] "She's never sounded less <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> or more messily human," [...] the review claimed.|$|E

The {{transposition}} of the McArdles, like most charitable enterprises, had not been entirely a success. The children had blubbered at being torn away from their playmates and the alleys and runways which they infested. They were like lusty rats suddenly let loose in a fine new barn with no dark corners, no burrows, no rotten planks, chips, or coal-heaps to dig into or hide beneath. The alleys in Glenwood were leafy lanes, the streets parked and concreted, and the school-yard unnaturally clean and shaded by fine young trees--which no one was allowed to climb.|$|R
500|$|In {{the chapter}} [...] "(D)evolving Representations of Asian Women in Bond Films" [...] from her 2015 book For His Eyes Only: The Women of James Bond, writer Lisa Funnell argued Sévérine was {{characterized}} as the Asian Other {{through the black}} evening gown. By emphasizing the character's make-up and nails, she felt that the film draws on the iconography of the [...] "mysterious, alluring, and powerful Dragon Lady" [...] to establish an expectation that Sévérine is [...] "a powerful and commanding figure". While addressing this set-up, Funnell wrote that Sévérine's story arc had adhered more {{to that of the}} racial stereotype of the [...] "tragic Lotus Blossom," [...] a term that she coined and defined as the [...] "submissive and industrious figure who is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>please</b> the white male hero". She also categorized Aki and Kissy Suzuki as falling under this trope. She supported her assessment by pointing to the character's lack of agency and impact on the film's main narrative, describing Sévérine as [...] "one of the most disempowered, pitiful, and tragic women in the Bond film franchise". In comparison to her positive assessment of Wai Lin in the 1997 film Tomorrow Never Dies, Lisa Funnell criticized Sévérine as based on [...] "reductive, sexist, and racist" [...] ideas.|$|E

Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the film's look, and felt [...] "A well-matched ensemble {{rises to the}} challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills and no shortage of humor." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin said, [...] "A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "While Guardians takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into – and, for the most part, keeps you in – a fully realized other world." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy is a late summer treat — a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well," [...] calling it [...] "a refreshing confection of entertainment."
