40|$|Novel metal {{nanoparticles}} of Pd and Pt {{were prepared}} by sonochemical reduction of solutions containing H₂PtCl₆ or <b>K₂PdCl₄.</b> The effect of atmospheric gas on the {{particle size distribution}} was investigated. Average diameters {{and standard deviations of}} the Pd particles prepared under Ar (Pd/Ar) and N 2 (Pd/N₂) were found to be 3. 6 ± 0. 7 nm (Pd/Ar) and 2. 0 ± 0. 3 nm (Pd/N₂). Smaller and sharper distribution of the particle size was observed for the Pd particles formed under a N₂ atmosphere. In the case of Pt, a smaller and sharper distribution of the particle size was observed for the particles prepared under a Xe atmosphere. These relations can be explained in terms of a hot-spot temperature created by acoustic cavitation...|$|E
