25|$|A <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> is a {{statistically}} structured experiment in which several factors (watering levels, antibiotics, fertilizers, etc.) {{are applied to}} each experimental unit at varying (but integral) levels (high, low, or various intermediate levels). In a full <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> all combinations of levels of the factors need to be tested, but to minimize confounding influences the levels should be varied within any experimental run.|$|E
25|$|An {{orthogonal}} {{array of}} strength 2 {{can be used}} to design a <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment.</b> The columns represent the various factors and the entries are the levels that the factors can be applied at (assuming that all factors can be applied at the same number of levels). An experimental run is a row of the orthogonal array, that is, apply the corresponding factors at the levels which appear in the row. When using one of these designs, the treatment units and trial order should be randomized as much as the design allows. For example, one recommendation is that an appropriately sized orthogonal array be randomly selected from those available, then randomize the run order.|$|E

The full <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> is described in the Wikipedia page <b>Factorial</b> <b>experiment.</b> Four factors were considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). The results in that example were that the main effects A, C, and D and the AC and AD interactions were significant. The results of that example may be used to simulate a fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> using a half-fraction of the original 24 = 16 run design. The table shows the 24-1 = 8 run half-fraction experiment design and the resulting filtration rate, extracted from the table for the full 16 run [...] <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment.</b>|$|E

50|$|For {{more than}} two factors, a 2k <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> can usually be recursively {{designed}} from a 2k-1 <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> by replicating the 2k-1 experiment, assigning the first replicate to the first (or low) level of the new factor, and the second replicate to the second (or high) level. This framework can be generalized to, e.g., designing three replicates for three level factors, etc.|$|E

50|$|A {{fractional}} <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> {{is generated}} from a full <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> by choosing an alias structure. The alias structure determines which effects are confounded with each other. For example, the five factor 25 &minus; 2 {{can be generated}} by using a full three factor <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> involving three factors (say A, B, and C) and then choosing to confound the two remaining factors D and E with interactions generated by D = A*B and E = A*C. These two expressions are called the generators of the design. So for example, when the experiment is run and the experimenter estimates the effects for factor D, what is really being estimated {{is a combination of}} the main effect of D and the two-factor interaction involving A and B.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> {{contains two}} levels {{for each of}} two factors. Suppose an engineer wishes to study the total power used by each of two different motors, A and B, running at each of two different speeds, 2000 or 3000 RPM. The <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> would consist of four experimental units: motor A at 2000 RPM, motor B at 2000 RPM, motor A at 3000 RPM, and motor B at 3000 RPM.

40|$|Abstract: When {{experiments}} {{are carried out}} {{over a period of}} time or space, the response may be subjected to trend effect. In such situations, random allocation of treatments may no longer be appropriate. Instead, systematic run orders may have to be used to reduce or eliminate the trend effects. The resulting designs are referred to as trend-free designs. In <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments,</b> the experimental units may be affected by the trend effect over time. The trend effect may be linear, quadratic or higher order. Here we consider the linear trend effect in the experimental units. Different methods of construction of linear trend free <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> are given with examples in complete factorial and fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments.</b> Key words: Systematic run order, trend free designs, generalized foldover scheme...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} process variables, which {{more or less}} {{influence}} quality of a manufacturing process, {{and there are many}} parameters of a product, which constitute its quality. The control of variables of a manufacturing process for achievement of requested quality of a final product is a multi-parametric task. It is paid great effort to find such the way, which might lead to the most rapid solution. The use of full <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments,</b> fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> and Taguchi approach were compared {{from the point of view}} of number of experiments requested. It was found that the Taguchi orthogonal arrays are the most efficient method for higher number of process factors and that the full <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> request the highest number of experiments from all methods under test...|$|R

Principles of <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> are briefly reviewed and their application to design optimization is explained. In this application, experiments {{are replaced by}} magnetic field calculations. The procedure, which performs autmatically all the required numerical field calculations, is described. The whole procedure is applied to a typical problem concerning permanent magnet motors with polar pieces...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{statistical}} analysis of the results from factorial experiments, the sparsity-of-effects principle states that a system is usually dominated by main effects and low-order interactions. Thus it is most likely that main (single factor) effects and two-factor interactions are the most significant responses in a <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment.</b> In other words, higher order interactions such as three-factor interactions are very rare. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the hierarchical ordering principle. [...] The sparsity-of-effects principle actually refers to the idea that only a few effects in a <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> will be statistically significant.|$|E

50|$|For {{the vast}} {{majority}} of factorial experiments, each factor has only two levels. For example, with two factors each taking two levels, a <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment</b> would have four treatment combinations in total, and is usually called a 2×2 factorial design.|$|E
50|$|The median polish is an {{exploratory}} data analysis procedure {{proposed by the}} statistician John Tukey.

50|$|With more points, random {{deviations}} from a line {{will be less}} pronounced. Normal plots are often used with as few as 7 points, e.g., with plotting the effects in a saturated model from a 2-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>experiment.</b> With fewer points, it becomes harder to distinguish between random variability and a substantive deviation from normality.|$|E
50|$|The {{notation}} used {{to denote}} <b>factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> conveys {{a lot of}} information. When a design is denoted a 23 factorial, this identifies the number of factors (3); how many levels each factor has (2); and how many experimental conditions {{there are in the}} design (23=8). Similarly, a 25 design has five factors, each with two levels, and 25=32 experimental conditions. <b>Factorial</b> <b>experiments</b> can involve factors with different numbers of levels. A 243 design has five factors, four with two levels and one with three levels, and has 16 X 3=48 experimental conditions.|$|R
