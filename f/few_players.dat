5|$|For the 1947–48 Australian season, Miller {{transferred}} to New South Wales (NSW), {{for whom he}} played {{the remainder of his}} Sheffield Shield career. He also represented the New South Wales interstate football team at the 1947 Hobart Carnival, as vice captain. This {{made him one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>players</b> to play both football and cricket for two states.|$|E

5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size. <b>Few</b> <b>players</b> of his era who were as tall and big as he was could move as fast; only Larry Brink of the Rams was close to him in proportions.|$|E
5|$|At other times, Krichell {{collected}} some of {{the best}} prospects in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon. There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players they believed could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation. The <b>few</b> <b>players</b> who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Despite the scare {{over his}} back complaint, Miller {{returned}} from New Zealand {{to play in}} the 1946 season, {{which turned out to be}} his last season in the VFL; St Kilda's finished second-last. Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia. Miller thus became one of the <b>few</b> <b>players</b> to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football.|$|E

5|$|Humphreys then {{played for}} the Sheffield Boys {{and was one of}} their <b>few</b> <b>players</b> who did not play for a {{professional}} club. However, that soon changed when Humphreys was scouted by a Sheffield Wednesday scout and he joined their centre of excellence. He completed a boy-hood dream by scoring at Bramall Lane in a 3–2 win for Hartlepool in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively <b>few</b> <b>players</b> of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a <b>few</b> <b>players.</b> Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{injuries}} throughout his later years, Thome totaled, according to Fangraphs, 71.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a sabermetrics baseball statistic intended to quantify a player's total contributions to a team. He {{was one of}} <b>few</b> <b>players</b> whose prime was during the steroid era and was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using performance-enhancing drugs. Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified {{the end of his}} playing career), writers began to speculate {{as to whether or not}} Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, whether he would gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018. Writers also questioned whether Thome's candidacy would be hindered by his lack of self-promotion and others' tendency to overlook him.|$|E
5|$|Having traversed {{the major}} {{basketball}} continents in his basketball career, Ginóbili {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>players</b> who has enjoyed success under both the physical, one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical, jump-shooting rule set of FIBA. He is one of only two players in basketball history, along with Bill Bradley, to win the EuroLeague, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA Championship ring. He is also the first non-U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after Panama's Rolando Blackman).|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time <b>few</b> <b>players</b> had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Jones {{developed}} into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones often went in motion behind {{the line of scrimmage}} before the snap at a time when <b>few</b> <b>players</b> did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by the saxophone, which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the clarinet, but the clarinet did not entirely disappear. A <b>few</b> <b>players</b> such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. A little later, Eric Dolphy (on bass clarinet), Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used the clarinet in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on the clarinet with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} faced a chaotic situation. The team had <b>few</b> <b>players</b> under contract, {{and had made}} little effort to sign any of their draft picks, most of which had signed with the NFL. The league {{attempted}} to strengthen the Jets and the woeful Oakland Raiders {{by allowing them to}} select players from the other six teams, and by giving them the first opportunity to sign players cut from NFL rosters. Ewbank, who had discovered Colts great Johnny Unitas at an open tryout, held tryouts for the Jets. Only seven of the participants were invited to training camp, and one, Marshall Starks, made the team as a second-teamer. In mid-July, it was announced that the Jets could not move into Shea Stadium until 1964.|$|E

50|$|He {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>player</b> {{who have}} scored five goals in a single Greek Super League game. He did so in AEK Athens' 5-2 win against Egaleo during the 1984-85 season.|$|R
5|$|This {{assessment}} was left unchanged for decades, as <b>few</b> <b>players</b> {{at the highest}} level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by István Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 and a quick attack against b2.|$|E
5|$|He then struck 114 as {{his state}} {{defeated}} the tourists by an innings, {{and he made}} 40 and a duck as the Australians took the series lead in the Second Test. He made 70 and 71 in the Third Test loss in Sydney, one of the <b>few</b> <b>players</b> able to combat Lance Gibbs effectively, top-scoring in the first innings and second top-scoring in the second innings. He then made 65 in the second innings in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, where Australia held on by one wicket for a draw. He contributed 48 in the second innings of the Fifth Test as Australia appeared headed for a series victory. However, a late collapse ensued, and Australia scraped home by two wickets to take the series 2–1. O'Neill ended the series with 522 runs at 52.20. O'Neill gained attention during the summer for frequently losing his wicket by impulsively sweeping. This was attributed to the dominance of his bottom hand, which saw his bat swinging across the line of flight of the ball. Despite the criticism, {{he was at the}} peak of his international career, having made 1398 runs at 58.35 in his first 18 Tests.|$|E
5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} <b>few</b> <b>players</b> in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he felt a twinge in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because of continued pain in his shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E
