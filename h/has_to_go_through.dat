25|$|Throughout this process, {{every time}} the soul {{associates}} itself with a particular form, it collects through this medium impressions of the gross world. When the impressions through association with a particular form have been exhausted, the soul dissociates from that form. Yet the collected impressions must be further experienced and for this the soul associates with the next most developed form. So when the human form is reached, although consciousness is fully developed, it has a store of impressions that {{still need to be}} experienced. While the soul is no longer in search of a better medium, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> numerous human forms, until these impressions gathered through evolution are weakened and finally exhausted.|$|E

25|$|The Senate {{was modeled}} upon the United States Senate; the two {{chambers}} of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> both houses needs {{the consent of}} both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on third reading, the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house {{is different from the}} one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.|$|E
25|$|In BTW, {{initiation}} only accepts someone {{into the}} first degree. To proceed to the second degree, an initiate <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> another ceremony, in which they name and describe the uses of the ritual tools and implements. It is also at this ceremony that they are given their craft name. By holding the rank of second degree, a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft, or founding their own semi-autonomous covens. The third degree is the highest in BTW, and it involves {{the participation of the}} Great Rite, either actual or symbolically, and in some cases ritual flagellation, which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado-masochistic overtones. By holding this rank, an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E

25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E

2500|$|Lili is a Monégasque {{teenager}} {{who is the}} only child of a pacifistic oil tycoon. At the age of twelve, she had been held for ransom by a group of thugs, but unwittingly took out one of her captors in her attempt to break free. Lili consequently took pleasure in the thrill of defeating her opponents, but her father wants her to grow into a prim and proper lady and not a fighter. She nonetheless steals his private jet to travel abroad and compete in street fighting competitions. This gains the attention of an unknown individual who invites her to compete in the King of Iron Fist tournament, but Lili notices that the tournament organizer, the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation, had caused her father problems in the past. This makes her determined to emerge victorious {{and put an end to}} this situation, but she is thwarted by her rival Asuka Kazama, a relative of Mishima Zaibatsu CEO Jin Kazama. Before Lili can attempt to seek revenge, her father learns of her participation and confines her to the family home as punishment. However, the Zaibatsu later annexes her father's oil fields, negatively impacting the business and causing him to suffer anxiety attacks. Lili therefore again defies her father's policy of nonviolence and enters the sixth tournament to take back his property. In Tekken 6's [...] "Scenario Campaign" [...] story mode, Lili attempts to infiltrate the Mishima Zaibatsu and hunt down Jin, but she first <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> Lars Alexandersson and Alisa Bosconovitch in combat, which she fails.
