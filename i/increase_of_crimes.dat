40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the contemporaneous effect of education on adolescent crime by exploiting the implementation a reform {{that increases the}} school leaving age in Italy by one year. We find that the Reform increases the enrollment rate of all ages, but decreases the offending rate of 14 -year-olds only, who are the age group explicitly targeted by the Reform. The effect mainly comes from natives males, while females and immigrants are not affected. The Reform does not induce crime displacement in {{times of the year}} or of the day when the school is not in session, but it increases violent crimes at school. By using measures of enrollment and crime, as well data at the aggregate and individual level, this paper shows that compulsory education reforms have a crime reducing effect induced by incapacitation, but may also lead to an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> in school facilities plausibly due to a higher students concentration.

40|$|Purpose – Discuss the {{firearms}} {{control in}} Brazil, highlighting the State’s inefficiency {{to deter the}} access of criminals to weapons and reduce the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>crimes,</b> especially homicides, leaving citizens unprotected, at their own fate, without any mechanism at their disposal. Methodology/approach/design – Analysis of the literature and standards on firearms and ammunition control in Brazil, on violent deaths by firearms indexes, on the legal self-defense issue, on crime rates after the Disarmament Statute. Findings – The firearm control adopted in Brazil has been ineffective in fighting criminality and reducing violence, particularly homicides. This model solely prioritizes the restriction and difficult on the acquisition of guns and ammunitions by citizens, since it neither have mechanisms to effectively disarm criminals and restrain the firearms black market, nor prevent its illegal entrance across our borders. Despite the guarantee of self-defense in our legal system for life protection, the Brazilian State has not brought any means to guarantee this provision or has made it difficult enough {{for those who have}} a need or choose to exercise it. Practical implications – This paper demonstrates the ineffectiveness of firearms control in Brazil and all the barriers for self-defense, facing the rising criminality rates and the State’s impotence in maintaining public peace...|$|E

The <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> committed in our society and individualistic attitude of our people today, show that something must be done to change the mentality of the people so as to be more loving and caring towards man, nature and of course the universe. From the research done, it has been proven that music education is able to develop the potential of the students and the prove that music is as equally important as other core subjects. Therefore, it is time to change the public‘s perception that music is important towards the development of human unity, integrity and not to mention in calculating good value in the future generation. Moreover it is our government objective to see that every Malaysian lives in One Malaysia.
