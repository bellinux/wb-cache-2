50|$|Alicia {{decides to}} seek help from her boss, John Trelawny, {{who is running for}} presidency, and manages to {{convince}} him about Jamie's powers and to help him get into Silent Creek. Trelawny affirms Jamie's powers and agrees to help him. Jamie is given a false identity and crime and is put into the juvenile Centre. When he arrives, Jamie meets an <b>intake</b> <b>guard</b> named Joe Feather. Jamie manages to discover his brother is there in solitary confinement and Alicia's son Daniel is there too. One night, when he demands that a supervisor named Max Koring take him to his brother, he realizes that his powers do not work in the prison, because of some magnetic field that neutralizes special powers. Koring puts him in solitary confinement for his rudeness and secretly calls Banes to tell him he has found a Gatekeeper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For many species, mate {{guarding}} {{results in}} dramatic departures from normal behaviour that reflect compromised attention to feeding and other activities. Such departures have previously {{been difficult to}} document in primates, however. Data were gathered on two aspects of male behaviour that were predicted to be constrained during consortships, individual travel distance and duration of feeding bouts, for wild male baboons, Papio cynocephalus, {{in and out of}} mate-guarding episodes. In each case, consorting males were compared with themselves outside of consortships, and, in the case of distance travelled, they were compared also with non-consorting males matched for sample time and location. Males travelled significantly shorter distances while consorting than while not consorting, with the result that consorting males travelled distances similar to those travelled by females. Males also had significantly shorter feeding bouts while consorting. The shorter travel distances and feeding bouts experienced by consorting males may represent important constraints on male foraging activity, and probably result in decreased energy <b>intake</b> during mate <b>guarding.</b> Seasonal and non-seasonal breeding patterns will have different consequences for the magnitude of fluctuations in energy stores and depletions experienced during mate guarding, and costs of mate guarding in species that breed non-seasonally will be more difficult to document because they are necessarily smaller and temporall...|$|R
