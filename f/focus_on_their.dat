5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Edge and Mysterio went their {{separate}} ways to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> singles careers. Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match on January 19, 2003, where he had three eliminations before getting eliminated by Chris Jericho. Edge then teamed up with Chris Benoit, facing Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Charlie Haas, and Shelton Benjamin) {{in a series of}} singles and tag team matches. Prior to No Way Out, Edge suffered a legitimate neck injury, rendering him unable to compete in his scheduled match. At the event on February 23, Edge was written off television through a backstage attack. He then underwent surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood and was sidelined for over a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} {{eventually}} {{dropped out of}} school to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.|$|E
5|$|There were 32 IDWSs {{available}} to the Marine Corps in June 2012. The system had not been fired in combat as V-22s were routinely escorted by helicopter gunships and close air support aircraft, allowing them to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> transport role; squadrons also often flew without the belly gun, as the added weight reduced its cargo-carrying capacity. The Osprey's speed means that it can outrun supporting conventional helicopters, thus requiring a self-defense capability on long-range missions, and operate independently. The infrared gun camera has proven valuable for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons are being studied to provide an all-quadrant defensive weapon system including nose guns, door guns, and nonlethal countermeasures {{to work with the}} current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{explored the}} role of negotiator focus in disconnecting negotiated outcomes and evaluations. Negotiators who <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> target prices, the ideal outcome they could obtain, achieved objectively superior outcomes compared with negotiators who <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> lower bound (e. g., reservation price). Those negotiators who <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> targets, however, were less satisfied with their objectively superior outcomes. In the final experiment, when negotiators were reminded of their lower bound after the negotiation, the satisfaction of those negotiators who had <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> target prices was increased, with outcomes and evaluations becoming connected rather than disconnected. The possible negative effects of setting high goals and the temporal dimensions of the disconnection and reconnection between outcomes and evaluations are discussed. Given that so many important aspects of life depend on the outcomes of negotiations, it seems natural that people try to maximize their potential gains when negotiating with others. To procure beneficial outcomes, negotiators should set aggressive, motivating goals for themselves. In fact, many negotiators do set high goals (Kelley, 1966), {{and there is a}} relationship between th...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E

Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E

5|$|When the Sasanians reached Chalcedon in 615, {{it was at}} this point, {{according}} to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian client state, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor. Things began to look even more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople. Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed {{that he did not have}} the authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrow, who rejected the peace offer. Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> invasion of Egypt. Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing Ancyra, an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{the debut}} game title of Japanese {{developer}} Monolith Soft. Company founder Tetsuya Takahashi acted as director and co-writer. Takahashi had previously worked at Square on the PlayStation RPG Xenogears. Initially planned as a six-part series and despite there being concept {{work for a}} sequel, Xenogears was left as a standalone project while Square decided to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> established franchises such as Final Fantasy. Another stated reason was that Square {{said they did not}} have the money available to invest in his concept. Following his departure from Square due to disagreeing with their strategy, Takahashi searched for another company which could help him create the game he and others from the Xenogears project envisioned. According to producer Hirohide Sugiura, most of the companies they contacted suggested forming Monolith Soft as an independent developer, with only Namco suggesting that they become a subsidiary, and was willing to both fund the production and manage the logistics and marketing, allowing Monolith Soft staff to focus solely on creating the game. Following this agreement, Namco helped in the development and marketing of the game. While production of the game began following the foundation of Monolith Soft in 2000, Takahashi had been working on the game's concept since 1999, intending it as a spiritual successor to Xenogears rather than a remake or sequel. Production at Monolith Soft took two years. The development budget apparently reached ¥1 billion—approximately $7,700,000 USD.|$|E
