The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, though a non-UEFA competition, is officially recognised as UEFA Cup's precursor, and is therefore also incorporated into this list. The 1979 Intercontinental Cup co-hosted by UEFA and CONMEBOL is also included in this list.|$|E
5|$|San Marino set a <b>European</b> <b>record</b> {{when they}} went over 20 games without scoring between October 2008 and August 2012. On 8 September 2015, San Marino scored its first away goal in 14 years when Matteo Vitaioli scored against Lithuania in Euro 2016 qualification.|$|E

5|$|Chambers is {{the current}} <b>European</b> <b>record</b> holder in the 60m with 6.42s and is the third fastest {{sprinter}} {{in the history of}} the event after Andre Cason and Maurice Greene. Chambers shares the British and European records for the 4×100metres relay with Gardener, Darren Campbell and Marlon Devonish with their 37.73s finish at the 1999 Seville World Championships. It is also the fastest time recorded by a team outside of the IAAF's North, Central American and Caribbean region.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's 1937 British Home Championship {{match against}} England {{set a new}} world record for a {{football}} attendance. The Hampden Park crowd was officially recorded as 149,415, though the true figure is unknown as {{a large number of}} additional fans gained unauthorised entry. This attendance was surpassed 13 years later by the decisive match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, but remains a <b>European</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|The record {{attendance}} for Germany was 73,680 in the 2011 Women's World Cup opening {{game against}} Canada at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. That game also {{set a new}} <b>European</b> <b>record</b> in women's football. Away from home, the team's crowd record was 54,642 in the 1999 Women's World Cup quarter-final against the United States at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover.|$|E

5|$|After Commonwealth {{disappointment}} on home turf, Chambers {{won gold}} medals in the 100m and 4×100m relay at the 2002 European Championships in Munich, setting a championship record of 9.96s. Chambers recorded a time of 9.94s at the Weltklasse Zürich meeting, again beating world record holder Greene. He finished the season by equalling Linford Christie's <b>European</b> <b>record</b> at the 2002 IAAF Grand Prix Final. His run of 9.87s with a maximum allowable wind of +2.0m/s left him second to Tim Montgomery, who set a world record of 9.78s. Chambers received the 2002 European Athlete of the Year Trophy for his achievements on the track that year.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal had {{a better}} <b>European</b> <b>record,</b> {{compared}} to Galatasaray going into the match; they defeated Anderlecht with a 4–3 aggregate winning result, in {{the final of the}} 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The London–based club reached the Cup Winners' Cup finales three times, in 1980, where they suffered a 4–5 defeat in a penalty shoot-out to Valencia, following a 0–0 stalemate; Arsenal also reached the 1994 final, winning 1–0 over Parma, and the following edition, losing 1–2 at the hands of Real Zaragoza. Their 1994 success led to them qualifying for that year's European Super Cup, where they were beaten 2–0 by Milan on aggregate in two games. This was Arsenal's first UEFA Cup (sixth in total) European final. The club were considered favorites to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Dwain Anthony Chambers (born 5 April 1978) is {{a retired}} British track sprinter. He has won {{international}} medals at World and European level {{and is one of}} the fastest European sprinters in the history of athletics. His primary event is the 100metres, in which he has the fourth fastest time by a British sprinter. He is the <b>European</b> <b>record</b> holder for the 60 metres and 4×100 metres relay events with 6.42seconds and 37.73s respectively. He received a two-year athletics ban in 2003 after testing positive for THG, a banned performance-enhancing drug.|$|E

25|$|As the RIAA curve was {{essentially}} an American standard, it had little impact outside the USA {{until the late}} 1970s when <b>European</b> <b>recording</b> labels began to adopt the RIAA equalization. It was even later when some Asian recording labels adopted the RIAA standard. In 1989, many Eastern <b>European</b> <b>recording</b> labels and Russian recording labels such as Melodiya were still using their own CCIR equalization. Hence the RIAA curve did not truly become a global standard until the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The only pre-1978 <b>European</b> <b>records</b> {{not listed}} in the world record {{progression}} are Schlosser's record-breaking 67th cap and Severino Minelli's record-equalling 68th cap.|$|R
5|$|The highest {{attendance}} {{recorded at}} Hampden for a football match was 149,415, for the 1937 British Home Championship tie between Scotland and England. This {{is still a}} <b>European</b> <b>record</b> for an international match. The 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew an official crowd of 147,365, a world record for a club match, with 20,000 more people locked outside. Hampden set world attendance records that year that were only surpassed by the Maracanã, and it still holds all the major European records. The European Cup match between Celtic and Leeds United in 1970 was attended by 136,505, which is a UEFA competition record.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} 19th century stadia called Hampden Park, built on {{different}} sites. A stadium {{on the present}} site was first opened on 31 October 1903. Hampden was the biggest stadium in the world when it was opened, with a capacity in excess of 100,000. This was increased further between 1927 and 1937, reaching a peak of 150,000. The record attendance of 149,415, for a Scotland v England match in 1937, is the <b>European</b> <b>record</b> for an international football match. Tighter safety regulations meant that the capacity was reduced to 81,000 in 1977. The stadium has been fully renovated since then, with the most recent work being completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Benfica defeated Stade Dudelange 18–0 on aggregate, establishing a <b>European</b> <b>record</b> for biggest win on aggregate. However, {{at a later}} stage of the competition, they conceded a record home defeat to Manchester United and were eliminated. After a one-year competing in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Benfica returned to the European Cup and reached their fifth final in 1968. After eliminating Juventus 3–0 in the semi-finals, Benfica faced Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on 29 May 1968. Bobby Charlton opened the score but Jaime Graça equalised on the 79th minute. Near the end of regular time, Eusébio squandered a one-on-one chance against Alex Stepney and the match went to extra time, where three goals in eight minutes gave the English side their first European title.|$|E

25|$|Over 60 m, Christie set a <b>European</b> <b>record</b> of 6.47s in 1995 {{which was}} beaten by fellow Briton Jason Gardener in 1999 with 6.46s.
