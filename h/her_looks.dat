5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress {{with a pair of}} feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps and plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted leotard and a number of tentacles attached to the dress as well as a headpiece with two tentacles from it.|$|E
5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E
5|$|Natasha {{models for}} a PirateNet {{advertising}} campaign, where she meets Andrew Robinson and Summer Hoyland. Natasha gets {{into trouble with}} her father, Michael (Sandy Winton), after he finds out she lied by saying she was eighteen on the consent form. He threatens to sue the station owner and Andrew's father, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Natasha and Andrew work together to change the posters, so {{they are no longer}} revealing. They then attend a concert together and kiss {{at the end of the}} night. Natasha clashes with Summer and starts a rumour that her boyfriend, Chris Pappas (James Mason), bought the basketball team captaincy. Her relationship with her father is strained further when he learns she started the rumour. The schools English teacher, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), discovers Natasha is hiding her maths skills and makes her join the Mathletes as a punishment. Natasha wonders if Andrew is only with her because of <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> and she becomes insecure about their relationship.|$|E

50|$|The Red Light album has a {{dark and}} eerie concept, which f(x) said they liked.

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

25|$|In {{her late}} adolescence, Lady Diana {{was at the}} top of the list of {{eligible}} high society brides due to both <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> and her closeness to the tremendously rich Dowager Duchess of Marlborough. The Duke of Somerset attempted to procure her marriage to his grandson, Master Wyndham. The Viscount Weymouth and the Earl of Shaftesbury were also Lady Diana's suitors.|$|E

25|$|The city {{constructed}} a bronze statue of Romero {{but it is}} controversial. The statue depicts a stern, conservatively dressed woman holding an open book. Many claim the statue is a misrepresentation. The plinth notes her works of charity in her later years, but the real reason she is admired is that she amassed her wealth and power using <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> and shrewdness, considered a Tehuana trait.|$|E
25|$|He {{ultimately}} left Dupont for {{her friend}} Rosalie ('Lilly') Texier, a fashion model whom he married in 1899, after threatening suicide if she refused him. However, although Texier was affectionate, practical, straightforward, and well liked by Debussy's friends and associates, he became increasingly irritated by her intellectual limitations {{and lack of}} musical sensitivity. Moreover, <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> had prematurely aged, and {{she was unable to}} bear children.|$|E
25|$|Lillie Langtry (usually spelled Lily Langtry in the United States), born Emilie Charlotte Le Breton (October 13, 1853 – February 12, 1929), was a British-American {{woman who}} was celebrated as young woman of beauty and charm, and later {{established}} a reputation as an actress and producer. <b>Her</b> <b>looks</b> and personality attracted interest, commentary, and invitations from artists and society hostesses.

25|$|Bhanurekha Ganesan (born 10 October 1954), {{better known}} by her stage name Rekha, is an Indian film actress. Noted for her {{versatility}} and acknowledged {{as one of}} the finest actresses in Indian cinema, Rekha started her career in 1966 as a child actress in the Telugu film Rangula Ratnam, though her film debut as a lead happened four years later with Sawan Bhadon. Despite the success of several of her early films, she was often panned for <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> and {{it was not until the}} mid-to-late 1970s that she got recognition as an actress.|$|E
25|$|For years, Knorr {{abused and}} {{tortured}} {{her children in}} various ways including beating them, force-feeding them, burning them with cigarettes, and throwing knives at them. She made her children hold each other down while she beat and tortured them. In one instance, she held a pistol to her youngest daughter Terry's head and threatened to kill her. Knorr primarily focused her anger and abuse on her Terry's older sisters, Suesan and Sheila. In an interview, Terry said her mother resented that Suesan and Sheila were maturing and blossoming into attractive young women while she faced the prospect of losing <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> as she aged.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Alexandra's death, Yakov {{remarried}} {{with the}} children's German governess. While they materially {{were brought up}} in comfort, the children had little emotional support from their step-mother. As a result, Parnokh felt {{that she had been}} forced to grow up too fast and did not have a childhood. In 1894, she entered the Mariinskaya Gymnasium and from this period, began writing profusely, producing around 50 poems which are representative of her juvenilia. Unlike her brother's teenage writings, Parnokh's works from the period do not reflect influences of the decadent or symbolist artists who were prolific at this time. Instead, her work explored her feelings, burgeoning lesbianism, and fantasies with a more psychological, than artistic purpose. Through her poetry, she became unperturbed by disapproval and seemed to accept her lesbianism as an innate trait that made her unique and different. In addition, she suffered from Graves' disease, which affected <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> and made her feel increasingly unusual, as did her intense identification with both Russia and her Jewishness—a position not shared by her father's indifference to his religion nor her brother's loathing of Russia and the antisemitism he faced.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2007, Saran {{made her}} {{comeback}} in Hindi cinema with Awarapan, {{which was a}} joint production between India and Pakistan. She played a Muslim woman and had to learn Urdu. This was her fourth Hindi film, but the others had failed to make any impact. Sanjay Ram, writing for Business of Cinema, gave the film 2.5 of 5 stars and said that Saran provided a brief, compelling performance. Saran later said that the film strengthened her conviction that all religions are equal. Later that year she appeared in one more Tamil film, Azhagiya Tamil Magan, opposite Vijay. Though critics exalted <b>her</b> <b>looks,</b> her performance received mixed reviews, with one reviewer, Nandhu Sundharam of Rediff, {{going so far as}} to say that her [...] "acting is as bad as <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> are good". That same year Saran made a special appearance in a scene in the Kannada film Arasu. She appeared in six films in 2007 in four languages.|$|E
500|$|Björk's embracement of England's dance culture also {{extended}} to <b>her</b> <b>looks,</b> her style {{at the time}} considered representative of 1990s acid house fashion. Although One Little Indian estimated that Debut would sell 40,000 copies worldwide based on {{an estimate of the}} Sugarcubes' fan base at the time, within three months of its release, over 600,000 copies had been sold worldwide. According to NME, it turned [...] "an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star". The album received generally positive reviews from the British music press, although American critics were nonplussed by its sonority.|$|E

500|$|Guillermo del Toro (who {{directed}} her in Crimson Peak) believes that Chastain is [...] "interested in being chameleonic" [...] {{and that she}} brings authenticity even to bizarre situations. Sophie Heawood of The Guardian believes that Chastain's ability to bring very little ego to her roles renders her unrecognisable to the audience. Sarah Karmali of Harper's Bazaar opines that [...] "she goes for total immersion, sinking so deep into character that her face seems to change shape with each one". Lea Goldman of Marie Claire compares her craft to that of actresses Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett, and writes that she values her craft over <b>her</b> <b>looks.</b>|$|E
500|$|Achhut Kanya (1936), the studio's next {{production}} was a tragedy drama that had Devika Rani and Ashok Kumar portraying {{the roles of}} an untouchable girl and a Brahmin boy who fall in love. The film is considered a [...] "landmark" [...] in Indian cinema as it challenged the caste system in the country. The casting of Devika Rani was considered a mismatch as <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> did not match {{the role of a}} poor untouchable girl by virtue of her [...] "upper-class upbringing". However, her pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular and they went on to star in as many as ten films together with most of them being Bombay Talkies productions.|$|E
500|$|Michele bases Rachel {{on herself}} {{when she was}} younger, and also draws {{inspiration}} for the character variously from films including Election, and television portrayals such as the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf. [...] "Rachel will never be popular because <b>her</b> <b>looks</b> aren't considered beautiful," [...] said Michele, [...] "and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be." ...|$|E
