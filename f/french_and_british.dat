5|$|According to {{historian}} Jean-Francois Lozier, {{the factors}} influencing {{the course of}} war and peace throughout the region of New-France were not exclusive to the relations between the French and Iroquois, or those between the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> crowns. A number of factors provide context for the Lachine Massacre.|$|E
5|$|The Glorious First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} the major problems inherent in the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> navies {{at the start of the}} Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E

50|$|The ongoing wars {{between the}} various ethnic groups, along with the {{military}} action from the north by the Futa Jalon Almamate into the Temne territories, threatened the Sierra Leone-related economic interests of the European colonial powers. The <b>French</b> <b>and</b> the <b>British</b> then intervened militarily, with the French expanding into Guinea in early 1880s <b>and</b> the <b>British</b> expanding from the south through Freetown. In 1889, the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> the <b>British</b> had brought the region under their effective control, and they negotiated a boundary between the <b>French</b> Guinea <b>and</b> <b>British</b> Sierra Leone. The Temne territories went to the British.|$|R

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.|$|E

5|$|During the Spanish Civil War, several {{countries}} followed {{a principle of}} non-intervention, to avoid any potential escalation and possible expansion of the war to other nations, which {{would result in the}} signing of the Non-Intervention Agreement in August 1936 and the setting up of the Non-Intervention Committee, which first met in September. Primarily arranged by the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> governments, important members of the committee also included the Soviet Union, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Ultimately, the committee had the support of 27 nations.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks before}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> military intelligence, which {{had been unable to}} make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.|$|E
5|$|France, Russia and the United Kingdom {{recognised}} {{the autonomy}} of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept {{the terms of the}} convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a show of force was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E

5|$|<b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> patrol frigates each {{spotted the}} other's fleet around 9:30 am; both at first underestimated {{the size of}} the other fleet, leading each {{commander}} to believe the other fleet was the smaller fleet of Admiral de Barras. When the true size of the fleets became apparent, Graves assumed that de Grasse and Barras had already joined forces, and prepared for battle; he directed his line toward the bay's mouth, assisted by winds from the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|In September 1854, the Anglo-French {{army that}} had been at Varna was ferried across the Black Sea and landed on the Crimean Peninsula. They then fought {{their way to the}} main Russian naval base on the peninsula, the city of Sevastopol, which they placed under siege. The Russian {{garrison}} eventually withdrew from the city in early September 1855, freeing the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> fleets for other tasks. A discussion ensued over what target should be attacked next; the <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> high commands considered driving from the Crimea to Kherson and launching major campaigns in Bessarabia or the Caucasus. Instead, at the urging of French commanders, they settled on a smaller-scale operation to seize the Russian fort at Kinburn, which protected the mouth of the Dneiper. The British argued that to seize Kinburn without advancing to Nikolaev would only serve to warn the Russians of the threat to the port. Fox Maule-Ramsay, then the British Secretary of State for War, suggested that without a plan to exploit the capture of the fortress, the only purpose of the operation would be to give the fleets something to do.|$|E
5|$|Michigan was {{originally}} part of <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> holdings, and administered by their colonial governors. After {{becoming part of}} the United States, numerous areas of what is today Michigan were originally part of the Northwest Territory, Indiana Territory and Illinois Territory, and administered by territorial governors. In 1805, the Michigan Territory was created, and five men served as territorial governors, until Michigan was granted statehood in 1837. Forty-eight individuals have held the position of state governor. The first female governor, Jennifer Granholm, was elected in 2003.|$|E

By the end of 1885, the two powers were on the brink of armed confrontation, but opted instead to turn negotiations.

The French squadron, under Vice-Admiral Corentin Urbain Leissègues in the 120-gun Impérial, had sailed from Brest in December 1805, one of two squadrons intending to raid British trade routes {{as part of the}} Atlantic campaign of 1806.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tory Island (sometimes {{called the}} Battle of Donegal, Battle of Lough Swilly or Warren's Action) was a naval {{action of the}} French Revolutionary Wars, fought on 12 October 1798 between <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> squadrons off the {{northwest}} coast of County Donegal, then in the Kingdom of Ireland. The last action of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Battle of Tory Island ended the final attempt by the French Navy to land substantial numbers of soldiers in Ireland during the war.|$|E

5|$|The <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The German {{breakthrough}} at Sedan, {{which had}} been thought impassable, meant that defenders of the K-W Line risked being outflanked, and had to withdraw on 16 May. The German invasion triggered a panic amongst Belgian civilians {{in the path of}} the advancing German army. By 11 May, the roads leading westwards, away from the fighting, were blocked by refugees, hampering the eastward advance of <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>British</b> forces. It is estimated that around two million civilians fled their homes during the campaign.|$|E
