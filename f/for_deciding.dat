5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a public {{authority}} exercises a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are unlawful, the applicable test <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> whether the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful purpose is incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant purpose is itself unlawful. If the primary or dominant purpose is the authorized purpose, the administrative action may be held valid.|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of voting behavior of undecided voters poses {{a challenge to}} psychologists and pollsters. Recently, researchers argued that implicit attitudes would predict voting behavior particularly for undecided voters whereas explicit attitudes would predict voting behavior particularly <b>for</b> <b>decided</b> voters. We tested this assumption in two studies in two countries with distinct political systems {{in the context of}} real political elections. Results revealed that (a) explicit attitudes predicted voting behavior better than implicit attitudes <b>for</b> both <b>decided</b> and undecided voters, and (b) implicit attitudes predicted voting behavior better <b>for</b> <b>decided</b> than undecided voters. We propose that greater elaboration of attitudes produces stronger convergence between implicit and explicit attitudes resulting in better predictive validity of both, and less incremental validity of implicit over explicit attitudes for the {{prediction of}} voting behavior. However, greater incremental predictive validity of implicit over explicit attitudes may be associated with less elaboration...|$|R

5|$|The {{courts in}} Singapore have {{followed}} the legal position on errors as to precedent facts in the United Kingdom. This {{is illustrated by the}} High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985), which held that if a precedent fact is a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, the court is responsible <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> if the precedent fact has been satisfied. This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically in extra time to create more space and deciding the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E

From 31 December 1965, the Ministry of Information expanded its brief and was renamed the Ministry of Information, Immigration and Tourism, {{which meant that}} it was also responsible <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> whether to grant or revoke permits to visit Rhodesia. Several foreign journalists were expelled: John Worrall, correspondent for The Guardian, went in January 1969.

5|$|More formally, a {{tessellation}} or tiling is a {{cover of}} the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called tiles, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from {{a finite number of}} prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape {{can be used as a}} prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.|$|E

When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E

5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the larger one.

Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Parliament holds {{legislative}} power {{and consists of}} the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. The supremacy of Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition {{with the majority of}} seats. If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> significant government actions. Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.|$|E

40|$|Implicit attitudes {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{as a key to}} unlock the hidden preferences of undecided voters. Past research, however, offered mixed support for this hypothesis. The present research used a large nationally representative sample and a longitudinal design to examine the predictive utility of implicit and explicit attitude measures in the 2008 U. S. presidential election. In our analyses, explicit attitudes toward candidates predicted voting better <b>for</b> <b>decided</b> than undecided voters, but implicit candidate attitudes were predictive of voting <b>for</b> both <b>decided</b> and undecided voters. Extending our examination to implicit and explicit racial attitudes, we found the same pattern. Taken together, these results provide convergent evidence that implicit attitudes predict voting about as well for undecided as <b>for</b> <b>decided</b> voters. We also assessed a novel explanation for these effects by evaluating whether implicit attitudes may predict the choices of undecided voters, in part, because they are neglected when people introspect about their confidence. Consistent with this idea, we found that the extremity of explicit but not implicit attitudes was associated with greater confidence. These analyses shed new light on the utility of implicit measures in predicting future behavior among individuals who feel undecided. Considering the prior studies together with this new evidence, the data seem to be consistent that implicit attitudes may be successful in predicting the behavior of undecided voters...|$|R

5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{criticism}} of the design, its height and the proposed location, both from local councillors (of all parties) and from people in the local community. Planning permission was denied in April 2005, but the Beetham Organization lodged an appeal and a public inquiry was held in November 2006. Ruth Kelly, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, was responsible <b>for</b> <b>deciding</b> whether to overrule the council's decision and approve the tower. A final decision on the site was initially expected in February 2007, but the inquiry eventually continued until 17 May 2007, when the decision to refuse planning permission was upheld. As well as agreeing with the council's original argument that the tower would not fit into the local area and would have a harmful effect on surrounding conservation areas (such as the North Laine and St Bartholomew's Church), Kelly stated that the proposal would give insufficient benefit in terms of regeneration of the area, and did not offer enough outdoor leisure and recreation space. The future of the Block J site is undecided {{as a result of}} this; however, within four days of the decision, the Beetham Organization announced that it intended to submit plans for an alternative scheme, which it would develop in consultation with the city council.|$|E
