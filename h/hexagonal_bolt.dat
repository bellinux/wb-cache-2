40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} windage associated with enclosed rotor-stator systems with superposed throughflow, as commonly found in gas turbine engines. The term windage {{is often used to}} describe the viscous heating that arises from the interaction of surfaces and fluids in rotating disc systems. Since the presence of circumferentially discreet geometric features strongly alters the magnitude of Windage measured, the physical mechanisms collectively referred to as windage in this paper are separately described as part of the discussion of results. Tests have been carried out to measure windage directly in the form of shaft torque and also rotor surface temperature. Non-dimensional flow parameters are used to expand the relevance of the data obtained, which encompasses the ranges 0. 17 x 107 ≤ Reφ ≤ 1. 68 x 107 and 0. 24 x 105 ≤ Cw ≤ 1. 06 x 105 which corresponds to 0. 058 ≤ λT ≤ 0. 631. Data has been obtained for smooth disc geometry and also with rotor mounted protrusions of N = 3, 9 and 18; D = 10 mm, 13 mm and 16 mm diameter; H = 11 mm, high, <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bolt</b> shaped protrusions. Bi-hexagonal (twelve sided) bolts of D = 13 mm effective diameter, and height, H = 11 mm, were also tested with conditions closely matched to the 13 mm hexagonal bolts. Finally, tests with 10 mm diameter, 6 mm deep, pockets were also carried out. Over the range of conditions and geometries tested, increasing the number of bolts increases the moment coefficient and windage heating. At low values of turbulent flow parameter, λT, which correspond to rotational speeds between 8000 and 10000 rev/min, increasing the diameter of the bolts shows a clear trend for both increased windage torque and average disc temperature rise. For these conditions, there also appears to be a clear reduction in windage and temperature rise with the bi-hexagonal shaped bolts compared to the equivalent diameter <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bolt</b> form. Variation in the moment coefficient with the number and diameter of bolts is attributed to variations in form drag between the different configurations. The introduction of the recesses onto the disc has very little effect on either windage heating or moment coefficient; this is attributed to the component of windage mechanism in operation and also the relatively small size in comparison to the protrusions studied here. This work contributes to the understanding of windage in gas turbines by introducing new low uncertainty data obtained at engine representative conditions and as such is of benefit to those involved with the design of internal air systems and disc fixture...|$|E

Rather than make minimal interventions, as modern conservation practice requires, the restorers made considerable changes to the design.

40|$|The torque {{associated}} with overcoming the losses on a rotating disc {{is of particular}} importance to the designers of gas turbine engines. Not only does this represent a reduction in useful work, but it also gives rise to unwanted heating of metal surfaces and the adjacent fluid. This research presents a numerical study {{on the effect of}} rotor-mounted bolts on the moment coefficient and flow structure within a rotor–stator cavity under conditions representative of modern gas turbine engine design. Steady-state, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, computational fluid dynamics simulations are obtained using the FLUENT commercial code with a standard (k–ω) turbulence model. The model is firstly validated against experimental data and then used to study the effects of presence of rotormounted <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bolts</b> in the rotor-stator cavity under investigation using different dimensionless flow parameters. Also investigated were the effects of changing the number and size of rotor-mounted bolts on the flow structure and amount of losses for two test cases; one corresponding a throughflow dominated condition and the other corresponding a rotationally dominated one. The simulation results showed that decreasing the throughflow rate reduces the area of the wake region causing the wakes to become more circumferential in their path around the bolts. Also it was found that increasing the number and diameter of bolts respectively reduces and increases the area of the wake region. For N> 18 a separation bubble forms above the bolt which its length increases with increasing the number of bolts. The total moment coefficient of all bolts in the system increases with increasing the number of bolts. However, the rate of this increase reduces by mounting more bolts. While increasing the diameter of the bolts consistently increases the moment and drag coefficients for the rotationally dominated condition, for the throughflow dominated case an increase and a reduction was observed for respectively the moment and drag coefficients...|$|R
40|$|When the London Metal Exchange {{figures and}} graphs are {{analyzed}} {{it is clearly}} shown that the steel prices are in a hike. And also China and India are trying to acquire Sri Lankan market. Hence, the steel manufacturers have been facing many difficulties with the price competition and the rising costs. Therefore, waste elimination and productivity improvement methods needed to be introduced to the <b>Hexagonal</b> Nut and <b>Bolt</b> manufacturing Industries in Sri Lanka. This report contains a successful case study carried out at Company X Ltd which represents this industry and shows how to apply these methods to other factories for their future protection. This also contains a literature survey carried out regarding waste elimination, productivity improvement and Nut and Bolts and their manufacturing. Interviews were carried out at Company X Ltd and found out the major problems to the organization which relevant to the industry. Then wastes and losses were found out {{with the support of}} Cleaner production Techniques. After that made a suitable questionnaire and got the details from the other companies. Then found the most important problems to be solved and solutions given with the technical knowledge {{and with the help of}} external expertise. Appreciable results were obtained as an overall improvement of 3 3 % while reducing the damaging the cold forging dies of the heading machine by 33 %;reducing the rework at lubrication process by 60 %; reducing the water consumption at the lubrication process by 50 %; reducing the electricity consumption in the lubrication process by 25 %; reducing the scrap iron collection by 20 %; reducing the consumption of chaser dies by 33 %; reducing the buffer stocks in the process by 10 % and reducing the labour idling by 30 % As the other <b>Hexagonal</b> Nut and <b>Bolt</b> manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka showed the similar issues in their processes they can use this methodology to solve their issues and face the critical situation successfully.

30|$|High {{stresses}} at the pin–bone interface {{contribute to}} micro-motion and failure resulting in unicortical loosening. Experimental models have demonstrated far higher pressures are generated under loading {{conditions at the}} bone interface from half pins as compared to fine wires [5]. The pin–bone interface has therefore been regarded as the weakest link in the mechanical stability of external fixation systems and has been investigated extensively [6, 7, 8]. In contrast, no studies {{have looked at the}} interface between the half pin and frame assembly. Loss of stability here compromises the bone remodelling process through a change in the biomechanics of the construct. In the systems of Ilizarov and Taylor Spatial frames (TSF) external fixation by Smith and Nephew, grub screws are used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate 2 different methods used (grub screw or 10  mm stainless steel <b>hexagonal</b> headed <b>bolt</b> [M 6 A 2 - 70]) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. This is to determine whether use of bolts is appropriate and could reduce the potential for loosening at this interface.|$|R
40|$|The {{cooling air}} in a gas turbine engine is subject to windage as it flows through the {{internal}} air system. The work in this thesis focuses on the windage generated as the cooling air passes over the rotor surface, particularly for case where bolts are encountered. Reducing windage heating of the cooling air is of great importance to turbomachinery engineers, particularly in the aerospace industry, since the use of compressor air for cooling greatly reduces the thrust potential of an engine. The ability to accurately predict windage can help reduce the quantity of cooling air required, resulting in increased efficiency. A purpose built rig {{was used to measure}} both windage and rotor surface temperature as air passes through an enclosed rotor-stator cavity. A wide range of flow conditions were tested with some being close to those found in a modern gas turbine engine. A variety of both stator and rotor mounted bolts were investigated, of varying size and shape, as well as cavities in the disc surface. In addition, PIV measurements of the core tangential velocity were obtained. Test results show that windage is increased substantially with rotor bolts present, compared with a plain disc, and that it increases with increasing <b>bolt</b> size. For <b>hexagonal</b> rotor <b>bolts</b> a new correlation was produced between the moment coefficient and bolt diameter to pitch ratio for a range of flow conditions, characterised by the rotational and throughflow Reynolds numbers. Stator bolts were shown to generate a large increase in disc surface temperature compared with the plain disc at engine representative conditions. PIV measurements of the core tangential velocity showed an increase of up to 80...|$|R
