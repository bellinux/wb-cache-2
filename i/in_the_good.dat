5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

30|$|Disequilibrium {{analysis}} distinguishes {{four different}} macroeconomic regimes: (1) Keynesian Unemployment (KU) {{is characterized by}} excess supply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> and labor market, (2) Classical Unemployment (CU) is characterized by excess demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market and excess supply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labor market, 6 (3) Repressed Inflation (RI) occurs in case of excess demand <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> and labor market and (4) Labor Hoarding/Underconsumption (LH) results in case of excess supply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market and excess demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labor market. Concerning goods market conditions, (1) and (4) reflect Keynesian—and (2) and (3) neo-classical paradigms.|$|R
5|$|His early {{stand-up}} career led {{to supporting}} roles on television shows, {{during which he}} developed {{the character of a}} hapless middle-class bachelor. In 1993, Carey had a small role in the film Coneheads as a taxi passenger. In 1994, Carey co-starred with John Caponera <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Good</b> Life, a short-lived sitcom on NBC. After the show was cancelled, Bruce Helford, a writer on the show, hired Carey as a consultant for the television show Someone Like Me.|$|E
5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E

30|$|Outside the Walrasian equilibrium, disequilibrium {{analysis}} relates {{price and}} wage adjustment to <b>the</b> disequilibria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> and labor market as defined above. It predicts that in principle prices will rise (decrease) {{as a reaction}} to excess demand (supply) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market. Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labor market, wages will rise (decrease) {{as a reaction to}} excess demand (supply) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labor market. Depending upon the size of the elasticity of prices (wages) to excess supply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> (labor) market, this adjustment may take a shorter or longer period of time and be complicated by regime switches that could occur.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple {{general equilibrium model}} <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> only non-Walrasian feature is imperfect competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market. <b>The</b> model is shown to exhibit various Keynesian characteristics. In particular, as competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market becomes less perfect, the fiscal policy multipliers approach the values implied by the textbook Keynesian cross. ...|$|R

The final scene depicts Indiana kissing Sophia on top of the escape submarine, to comfort himself for the lack of evidence for their discovery.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E

50|$|In macroeconomics, {{equilibrium}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> supply of <b>goods</b> (output) equals <b>the</b> demand for <b>goods</b> (<b>the</b> sum {{of various types}} of expenditure - consumer expenditure, government expenditure on goods, net expenditures by people outside {{the country on the}} country's exports, fixed investment expenditure on physical capital, and intended inventory investment). If these are indeed equal for a particular time period, there is no unintended inventory investment and there is goods market equilibrium. If they are not equal, there is disequilibrium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market. This is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of positive or negative unintended inventory investment.|$|R
