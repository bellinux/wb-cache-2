5|$|The {{order of}} sejm {{proceedings}} was formalized in the 17th century. The lower chamber would {{do most of}} the statute preparation work. The last several days were spent working together with the Senate and the king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, the Senate, and the monarch. The lower chamber's rule of unanimity had not been rigorously enforced {{during the first half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree {{he still had a}} veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E

25|$|There are {{potential}} health hazards in wound licking due to infection risk, especially in immunocompromised patients. Human saliva contains {{a wide variety}} of bacteria that are harmless in the mouth, but that may cause significant infection if introduced into a wound. A notable case was a diabetic man who licked his bleeding thumb following a minor bicycle accident, and subsequently <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> thumb amputated after it became infected with Eikenella corrodens from his saliva. The practice of metzitzah during circumcision is controversial as it can transmit the herpes virus to the infant.|$|E
25|$|Not {{one of his}} librettists {{managed to}} produce a {{libretto}} on the same artistic level as Rameau's music: the plots were often overly complex or unconvincing. But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. This {{is why we have}} two versions of Castor et Pollux (1737 and 1754) and three of Dardanus (1739, 1744, and 1760).|$|E
25|$|Schenck ordered Lieutenant William H. Raynor {{to go back}} to {{the engine}} and have the {{engineer}} take the train out of range in the other direction. Schenck quickly followed Raynor. Raynor had to help loosen the brakes. Because the brakeman had uncoupled most of the cars, the engineer left them. He did not stop for the Union soldiers to catch up but continued all the way back to Alexandria. Schenck now had no means of communication and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> wounded men carried back to their camp in blankets by soldiers on foot.

25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

500|$|Male {{members of}} the Order are titled [...] "Knights Companion" [...] and female members are called [...] "Ladies Companion". Formerly, the Sovereign filled {{vacancies}} upon the nomination of the members. Each member would nominate nine candidates, of whom three <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> rank of earl or higher, three the rank of baron or higher, and three the rank of knight or higher. The Sovereign would choose as many nominees as were necessary to fill any vacancies in the Order. He or she was not obliged to choose those who received the most nominations. Candidates were last nominated in 1860, and appointments have since {{been made by the}} Sovereign acting alone, with no prior nominations. The statutes prescribing the former procedure were not amended, however, until 1953.|$|E
500|$|The {{directors}} {{admitted that}} they were not keen on hiring solely big-named, A-list celebrities or top-billed actors to voice the film's main characters. Howard explained that, in order to be cast, the actors simply <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> [...] "right voice" [...] for the characters, preferring voice actors [...] "who could ... bring a natural ease to those characters." [...] Greno elaborated, [...] "It was never about how big the star was ... It was always about ... who’s best for the part". Film critic James Berardinelli of ReelViews observed that this decision echoed [...] "Disney's approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when big name stars where often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents." [...] An additional asset was that the actor be able to perform well both independently and collaboratively.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the duke}} had seen navigable aqueducts in use on canals when {{travelling}} abroad on his Grand Tour, {{the idea of}} an such a structure carrying a canal over a river was new to England and was ridiculed by contemporary engineers. One brought in to review the plans, at Brindley's request, commented in a report to the Duke of Bridgewater that [...] "I have often heard of castles in the air, but never before saw where one was to be erected." [...] The necessary Act of Parliament was passed in March 1760, and was quite specific about the form the aqueduct had to take, to protect the viability of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation below. There was already a three-arch road bridge, Barton Bridge, passing over the Irwell, and the aqueduct was required not to restrict traffic on the river any more than the road bridge already did. It <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same number of arches, the foundations for which had to be fixed in the river bed, and the arches had to be at least as wide and high as those of the road bridge.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} statutes, based {{heavily on}} {{those of the}} Order of the Garter, prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by the Sovereign upon the nomination of the members. Each Knight was to propose nine candidates, of whom three <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> rank of Earl or higher, three the rank of Baron or higher, and three the rank of Knight or higher, and a vote taken. In practice this system was never used; the Grand Master would nominate a Peer, the Sovereign would usually assent, and a chapter meeting held at which the knights [...] "elected" [...] the new member. The Order of St Patrick differed from its English and Scottish counterparts, the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle, in only ever appointing peers and princes. Women were never admitted to the Order of St Patrick; they were not eligible to become members {{of the other two}} orders until 1987. The only woman {{to be part of the}} Order was Queen Victoria, in her capacity as Sovereign of the Order. Although it was associated with the established Church of Ireland until 1871, several Roman Catholics were appointed to the order throughout its history.|$|E
500|$|To {{reconstruct}} No. 1's existing runway as an all-weather strip, {{the bomb}} craters <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> water pumped {{out of them}} and then be filled in. Sandstone from a quarry on northern Labuan was placed over the clay and sand subbase, and the runway was topped with crushed coral from {{the west coast of}} the island, and sealed with bitumen. The [...] runway had 70 hardstandings for aircraft. With 70 also on the dry weather strip, the air base could accommodate 140 aircraft. The 9th Division's engineers also undertook a wide range of construction projects on Labuan. These included building [...] of storage, new port facilities, bridges and oil tanks as well as surfacing [...] of roads. A wharf for Liberty ships was begun on 18 June, allowing the first ship to berth on 10 July. A fuel jetty was in operation by 20 June, and a fuel tank farm with seven [...] tanks was completed on 12 July, as was a 600-bed hospital. Work then began on a 1,200-bed general hospital. The 2/4th and 2/6th Australian General Hospitals were transferred from Morotai to Labuan during July, though the later unit's hospital facilities were not completed until 17 September.|$|E
500|$|The Helicarriers in {{the film}} were {{completely}} digital. Earl said, [...] "In [...] {{it was more like}} an aircraft carrier, now it’s an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. We were all over the carriers [...] We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn’t just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all." [...] This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, [...] "The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> internals as well – the hallways, the storage areas." [...] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer. However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on Theodore Roosevelt Island on the Potomac River.|$|E
