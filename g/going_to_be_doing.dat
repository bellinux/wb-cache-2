[...] (United Artists was revamped as a joint venture with Scientologist Tom Cruise, his business associate Paula Wagner, who is chief executive of the company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.) Marina Hyde of The Guardian called Beghe a Scientology celebrity whistleblower.|$|E
500|$|Actress Joy Kilpatrick {{was cast}} as Dawson's photo double. Dawson {{described}} {{having a great}} working relationship with her stand-in. Discussing Kilpatrick, she said, [...] "I {{was about to tell}} her what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> so she could give me the beats that I could react to properly" [...] and found her to be supportive and intuitive. Kilpatrick was not credited for her performance in the episode. Kolbe noted that the episode used a lot of visual effects, specifically to create the illusion of the two versions of Torres. The casting of a photo double allowed Kolbe avoid relying on split screen. The scheduling was carefully planned to account for the make-up used for both roles.|$|E

The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long-term strategy. We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...|$|E

500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing.</b> So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the past films, the future of the {{franchise}} was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because you shoot out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because suddenly it was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> this again.|$|E
500|$|Spears {{explained}} that since {{she did not}} tour to promote Blackout, she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance— and if I do a trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations." [...] The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2.

500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted {{something}} that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy" [...] adding that it was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor’s face is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2010, Hilton became {{involved}} in the It Gets Better Project started by Dan Savage, urging celebrities to support gay teenagers who were being driven to suicide by anti-gay bullying. This prompted Khloé Kardashian to call out Hilton as her [...] "personal bully", claiming that it seemed hypocritical to make an anti-bullying message at the request {{of a man who had}} repeatedly bullied her. On October 13, 2010, Hilton posted a video on YouTube entitled [...] "I'm <b>Going</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Doing</b> Things Differently", in which he addressed his actions over the previous years, and apologized for bullying celebrities. Hilton vowed to change the occasionally malicious tone of his website, even if it meant losing readers and revenue. Hilton also announced the launch of three new websites: CoCoPerez.com, which focuses on fashion, FitPerez.com, which encourages physical fitness, and TeddyHilton.com, an animal rights site.|$|E
2500|$|Maayana Miskin of Arutz Sheva {{characterized}} the movement as [...] "a mass protest". Writing for The American Thinker, Ethel C.

[...] The editor of Family Security Matters, Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement {{from the perspective of}} freedom of speech, and commented, [...] "I realize that in a free society, someone is always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer." [...] Andrew Mellon of Big Journalism wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, [...] "The {{bottom line is that the}} First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. We are an equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American." [...] Mario Roy of La Presse discussed the incident, and noted, [...] "it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship. Fearing a possible threat, nothing is worse than the fear of fear." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 July 2012 Lewis {{released}} her first video {{prior to the}} album release, saying [...] "In the lead-up to my album, I wanted to make some video blogs and share with you my journey (!) and everything that goes on, from the video I'm doing very soon, to going on the road doing shows.

Later, another blog revealed that five songs had been recorded with the backing provided solely by piano and cello. The first of those acoustic performances was for the album's lead single, [...] "Trouble" [...] featuring Gambino. Filmed in black and white and featuring Lewis singing solo, the performance was released through Lewis' official Vevo account on 5 September.

She recalled: [...] "Everyone was there and Ja [...] {{was on the floor}} playing video games, and they had the beat playing in the background. Chris Gotti, Irv Gotti's brother, said 'Ja's supposed to be writing this record for J-Lo, but it doesn't look like he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> anything tonight. Why don't you go in there and see what's happening?' So that's exactly what I did." [...] Ashanti wrote two verses and recorded a demo for the new version of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] for Lopez. Gotti and 7 flew out to Los Angeles on September 10, 2001 to record the song with Lopez. The song was due to be recorded the following day, but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks.
