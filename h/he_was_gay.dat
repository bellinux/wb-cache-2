5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gay,</b> bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide the fact that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gay,</b> it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. They asked if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gay,</b> and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them {{to life in prison}} with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>gay,</b> and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

Following this, GLAD and the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU looked into the situation. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown is quoted as saying, “Based on the information I’ve heard, this person was terminated because he acknowledged <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gay.</b> And that’s illegal.” Due to mounting legal pressures and increasing amounts of negative publicity, by the end of the camping season, the Narragansett Council had reversed its decision and offered to reinstate Morello, both as an employee and as an Eagle Scout.|$|E
