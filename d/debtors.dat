5|$|Before the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, <b>debtors</b> in England were {{routinely}} imprisoned at {{the pleasure of}} their creditors. Around 10,000people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts. In the 18th century <b>debtors</b> comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were <b>debtors.</b> According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ₤5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ₤16,442 (over ₤1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but <b>debtors</b> in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two <b>debtors</b> were found to have been there for 30years.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the first}} Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 <b>debtors</b> within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned there for a debt of 40 shillings. Jerry White writes that London's poorest <b>debtors</b> were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier <b>debtors</b> secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of habeas corpus, and {{arranged}} to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, {{both of which were}} more comfortable. The prison also held a small number of men being tried at the Old Bailey for crimes at sea.|$|E
5|$|The debtors' section {{consisted}} of a brick barracks, a yard measuring , a kitchen, a public room, and a tap room or snuggery, where <b>debtors</b> could drink as much beer as they wanted, at fivepence a pot in 1815. Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most <b>debtors</b> spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 <b>debtors,</b> 99 {{of whom had been}} there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.|$|E

30|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} commitment operations on trust. Before we {{describe the}} effects, let us consider some situations wherein a commitment exists from a <b>debtor</b> toward a creditor. Effect of discharge. When a commitment is discharged, the creditor’s trust for the <b>debtor</b> increases. Effect of violation. When a commitment is violated, the creditor’s trust in the <b>debtor</b> decreases. Effect of delegation and discharge. When a commitment is delegated by the original <b>debtor</b> to a new <b>debtor,</b> and the new <b>debtor</b> satisfies it, the creditor’s trust in both the original and the new <b>debtor</b> increases. Effect of delegation and violation. When a commitment is delegated from the original <b>debtor</b> to a new <b>debtor</b> and the new <b>debtor</b> violates it, the creditor’s trust in both the original and the new <b>debtor</b> decreases. Effect of assignment and discharge. When the commitment is assigned from the original creditor to a new creditor and the original <b>debtor</b> discharges it, {{the trust of the}} original and new creditor for the original <b>debtor</b> increases. Effect of assignment and violation. When the commitment is assigned from the original creditor to the new creditor and the <b>debtor</b> violates it, the trust of the original and the new creditor for the original <b>debtor</b> decreases.|$|R

5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to <b>debtors</b> were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing <b>debtors</b> a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional {{in the cases of}} Williams v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
50|$|This code section then {{requires}} {{a comparison between}} the <b>debtor’s</b> “current monthly income” and the median income for the <b>debtor’s</b> state. If the <b>debtor’s</b> income exceeds the median income, then the <b>debtor</b> must apply the means test.|$|R
25|$|Although a {{creditor}} {{may have}} good reason for believing the <b>debtor</b> is insolvent, he will usually not {{be in a position}} to prove that the <b>debtor’s</b> liabilities exceed his assets. If, however, the creditor can establish that the <b>debtor</b> has committed one or more “act” of insolvency, he may seek an order sequestrating the <b>debtor’s</b> estate without having to prove that the <b>debtor</b> is insolvent. Therefore, a <b>debtor’s</b> estate may be sequestrated even though he is technically solvent.|$|R
25|$|The term “sequestration” {{should be}} used only with {{reference}} to a person’s estate. It is the <b>debtor’s</b> estate that is sequestrated, not the <b>debtor</b> himself. On the other by, both the <b>debtor’s</b> estate and the <b>debtor</b> himself may properly be described as insolvent.|$|R
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent <b>Debtors</b> Act 1813, <b>debtors</b> could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} Marshalsea, {{the second was}} {{notoriously}} cramped. In 1827, 414 out of its 630 <b>debtors</b> were there for debts under £20; 1,890 people in Southwark were imprisoned that year for a total debt of ₤16,442.|$|E

30|$|Burnett and Oren [19] {{examine the}} effects of {{delegation}} using a probabilistic trust model [20] and propose an approach for weighting trust updates based on shared responsibility or delegation. Burnett and Oren do not restrict the delegation chain length. In contrast, we restrict our trust update to delegation chains of length three (the <b>debtor,</b> the new <b>debtor,</b> and the creditor). For example, if the new <b>debtor</b> delegates the commitment to another <b>debtor</b> (debtor’), trust between <b>debtor</b> and debtor’ remains unaffected. This means if debtor’ satisfies or violates the commitment, the trust of the <b>debtor</b> toward debtor’ neither increases or decreases, respectively, since the <b>debtor</b> still depends on the new <b>debtor</b> to satisfy the commitment and may be ignorant of debtor’. We observe that such longer chains are rare in a real-world text corpus.|$|R
5|$|Castell had a friend, James Oglethorpe, a Tory MP who {{years later}} founded the American colony of Georgia. Oglethorpe {{began to ask}} {{questions}} about the treatment of debtor prisoners, and a group of <b>debtors,</b> perhaps at Oglethorpe's instigation, lodged a complaint about their treatment with the mayor of London and his aldermen, who interviewed the Fleet's warden on 21 December 1728.|$|E
5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the state were unable to repay their loans. A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and <b>debtors</b> seeking relief from obligations they could not meet. A Debt Relief Party sprang up in the state, which had long been a single-party bastion.|$|E
5|$|Moran's {{support for}} harsher {{bankruptcy}} law provisions and sponsorship of stricter bankruptcy legislation brought allegations in 2002 that his support came {{in return for}} financial favors by financial institutions which could benefit from such laws. In January 1998, one month before he introduced the legislation, credit card bank MBNA advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer <b>debtors</b> to declare bankruptcy. Moran received a $447,000 debt consolidation loan at over 10% interest rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{employer}} {{is known as}} the emoluments attachment <b>debtor</b> or garnishee. It is important to distinguish between the employer as an emoluments attachment order <b>debtor,</b> or garnishee, and the actual judgment <b>debtor.</b> Emoluments attachment orders are signed by the judgment creditor, or by a nominated attorney, {{as well as by the}} clerk, and are served by the sheriff on the emoluments attachment <b>debtor</b> or garnishee. An emoluments attachment order may be executed against the emoluments attachment <b>debtor</b> or garnishee as if it were a judgment of the court. The order is always subject to the rights of the judgment <b>debtor,</b> emoluments attachment <b>debtor</b> or any interested party to dispute the validity or correctness of the order.|$|R

5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the <b>debtors</b> out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply {{to cover the cost}} of the imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Sharp {{took office}} at a {{critical}} time Kentucky's history. Still reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to <b>debtors</b> (the Debt Relief Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, as had Governor Adair.|$|E
5|$|The Marshalsea (1373–1842) was {{a notorious}} prison in Southwark (now London), {{just south of}} the River Thames. Although it housed a variety of prisoners, {{including}} men accused of crimes at sea and political figures charged with sedition, it became known, in particular, for its incarceration of the poorest of London's <b>debtors.</b> Over half the population of England's prisons in the 18th century were in jail because of debt.|$|E
50|$|The <b>debtor's</b> {{rejection}} of {{the collective bargaining agreement}} does not terminate the <b>debtor's</b> duty to bargain with the union under the NLRA.Even if a bankruptcy court permits the <b>debtor</b> to reject the entire collective bargaining agreement, the <b>debtor</b> may unilaterally implement only those changes in employment contracts contained in its §1113 proposal to modify the agreement.|$|R
40|$|The debt {{collection}} process in Anglo-American law {{is based on}} the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right to receive payment from liquidation of the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets. Judicial procedures are available to the unsecured creditor for the purpose of converting the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets to cash. Whenever the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s matured liabilities are greater than his assets, the collection process may be characterized as one of 2 ̆ 2 grab law 2 ̆ 2 in which the first creditors to take the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets succeed in effectuating collection. It is an economic necessity for creditors to have an efficient collection mechanism which gives them maximum protection in the event of default by the <b>debtor.</b> Nonetheless, all states shield the <b>debtor</b> from complete destitution by keeping certain property, for example, life insurance proceeds, beyond the reach of creditors. By permitting the <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets necessary for his economic survival, state exemption laws fulfill important social policies which must be balanced against the need for creditor protection. When a <b>debtor</b> files a petition in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee takes title to most of the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s property, thereby enabling the trustee to liquidate the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets for the benefit of creditors. The twofold purpose of federal bankruptcy law is to give the <b>debtor</b> a fresh start by discharging his debts and to make an efficient, fair, and equitable distribution of the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets among his creditors. By recognizing exemptions, both the Bankruptcy Act now in effect and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 permit the <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets needed for a fresh start while protecting the rights of creditors with respect to the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s nonexempt property...|$|R

5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} <b>debtors</b> and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral.
