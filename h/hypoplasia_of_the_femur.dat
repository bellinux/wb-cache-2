30|$|The {{group of}} five {{individuals}} with PFFD all had severe malformations of the lower legs (such as tibia or fibula hypo- or aplasia), {{as well as in}} the upper extremities. Most had difficulties in walking and/or needed orthoses/prostheses. The remaining individuals did not have any severe malformations of the lower extremities, but, among these, half of the lower limbs showed radiological signs of a notch deformity, i.e. hypoplasia of the intercondylar part of the distal femur. This has been reported to appear as a sign of congenital insufficiency or absence of cruciate ligaments [30, 31], and has also been previously reported in children with congenital <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> [32] and of the lower extremity [33]. However, only two participants also showed sagittal knee instability at clinical examination, indicating insufficient cruciate ligament function, and another patient had previously undergone anterior ligament reconstruction surgery. Half of the lower limbs showed a hypoplastic lateral femoral condyle with a significantly increased valgus angle of the knee. The clinical importance of these findings is, however, unclear.|$|E
40|$|Primary {{osteoarthritis}} of the hip, {{often referred}} to as idiopathic, may be secondary to mechanical causes. There have been numerous studies on the measure-ment of torsion of the bones of the lower extrem-ity 1, 3, 8, 13, 14, 31, 34, 39, 44, 45, 47, 48, 54, 63, 79, 80, 84. Some studies have supported the hypothesis that a persistent increase in femoral an-teversion predisposes to osteoarthritis of the hip 29, 53, 54, 62, whereas others have not 35, 40, 61. Menke et al. 45 found an association between decreased acetabular anteversion and osteoarthritis of the hip, and Eckhoff 23 found a sim-ilar association between femoral anteversion and osteo-arthritis of the knee. Increased femoral torsion also has been documented in patients who have pain or osteoar-thritis of the knee and patellar instability 5, 22. There have been few reports on the potential prob-lems that are associated with decreased femoral an-teversion 15, 21, 36, 37, 51, 69. In 1959, Crane 15 noted that decreased femoral anteversion or retroversion was associated with a toeing-out gait whereas increased femoral anteversion was associated with a toeing-in gait. Decreased femoral anteversion has been consistently observed in patients who have a slipped capital femoral epiphysis 25, 28, 38, 52, 58, 59 as well as in those who have congenital <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> 60, 73...|$|E
40|$|Total {{arthroplasty}} {{was performed}} on 21 congenitally dislocated hips in 18 women. In all cases the femoral head was dislocated cranially at least one-fifth of {{the height of the}} pelvis. The components were both cemented, the acetabulum being replaced to its original position. The acetabular roof was reconstructed by bone graft in 13 hips, and frochanteric osteotomy was done in 18 hips. The patients were assessed at a median follow-up time of 7. 5 years when their median age was 54 years. Nine patients had been revised or required revision. At follow-up the average functional score (according to Charnley) was 6 for pain, 4 for walking abifity and 5 for range ofmotion. The Harris hip score was 82. The patients ’ subjective evaluation oftheir satisfaction with the late results on a visual analogue scale was 93, range 23 to 100. The high loosening rate in such patients demands regular follow-up and preparedness for revision surgery. Reconstruction by total hip arthroplasty in patients with severe congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) presents special problems of shortening of the limb, dysplasia of the acetabulum, <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur,</b> atrophy of the muscles and inability to balance the pelvis when walking.

40|$|ABSTRACTVarus supracondylar {{osteotomy}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> is <b>the</b> established {{procedure for}} treating painful knees that present lateral arthrosis and valgus deformity. In descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional surgical techniques, there are divergences regarding the location, access route, correction level, fixation type and area for synthesis insertion. This is {{most evident in}} cases of severe valgus with angles greater than 30 ° and distal femoral deformation, in association with <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral condyle. The authors describe a new surgical technique for distal femoral osteotomy, based on anatomical and geometrical criteria, which was developed in their clinic for treating severe valgus cases, and they present one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases treated. In the new technique, the wedge to be surgically resected has an oblique direction and <b>the</b> format <b>of</b> an isosceles triangle. This new proposal thus seeks to resolve problems that have been presented in such cases, through enabling valgus correction without causing any new deformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal <b>femur.</b> Good cortical bone contact is promoted, and application of a stable synthesis system is made easier. However, the age limits for such patients and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> knee arthrosis that might contraindicate this procedure remain unknown.

40|$|Introduction: Differences in <b>the</b> {{magnitude}} <b>of</b> bowing between {{races are}} well-known characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur.</b> Asian races {{have an increased}} magnitude of femoral bowing but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthopedic implants designed for <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> do not match this exaggerated bowing. We calculated the sagittal and coronal femoral bowing in the Japanese population at different levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and addressed its surgical significance. 				 					Material and methods: We calculated the sagittal and coronal bowing of 132 Japanese femora using CT scan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur.</b> A mathematical calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> curvature at proximal, middle, and distal regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> {{was used to determine}} <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> femoral bowing. 				 					Results: Mean sagittal bowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> was 581, 188, and 161  mm for the proximal, middle, and distal thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and mean lateral bowing was 528, 5092, and 876  mm, respectively. Mean sagittal and coronal bowing for <b>the</b> whole <b>femur</b> was 175 and 2640  mm, respectively. No correlation was found between age, gender, length <b>of</b> <b>femur,</b> and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> bowing. 				 					Conclusion: Our study reveals that femoral bowing in the Japanese population is 175  mm in the sagittal plane and 2640  mm in the coronal plane; these values are greater than the femoral bowing in other ethnic groups studied in the literature. 				This may result in varying degrees <b>of</b> mismatch between <b>the</b> western-manufactured femoral intramedullary implants and <b>the</b> Japanese <b>femur.</b> We recommend that orthopedic surgeons to accurately perform preoperative evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral bowing to avoid potential malalignment, rotation, and abnormal stresses between <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and implant...|$|R
40|$|Background: Horner {{syndrome}} (HS), {{also known}} as Claude-Bernard-Horner syndrome or oculosympathetic palsy, comprises ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and facial anhidrosis. Case Report: We report herein <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a 67 -year-old man who presented with congenital HS associated with ipsilateral <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal carotid artery (ICA), as revealed by heterochromia iridis and confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Conclusions: CT evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull base is essential to establish this diagnosis and distinguish aplasia from agenesis/hypoplasia (by <b>the</b> absence or <b>hypoplasia</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carotid canal) or from acquired ICA obstruction as demonstrated by angiographic CT...|$|R
