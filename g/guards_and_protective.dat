A roller straightening unit {{is used in the}} cutting process to straighten the wire, which the welding electrode consists of, by adjusting some of the rollers during operation. According to ESAB’s standard and the European machinery directives, moving parts of machinery, such as rollers of the roller straightening unit, must be out of the operator’s reach. <b>Guards</b> <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> devices should achieve their safety function with minimal downtime and the least reduction in productivity.

40|$|Protective relays are {{important}} parts of the power system. The protection <b>guards</b> valuable equipment, <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> relays {{play a vital role}} in performing the task. The relay detects fault conditions within an assigned area, opens and closes output contacts to cause the operation of other devices under its control. The relay acts to operate the appropriate circuit breakers to prevent damage to personnel and property. To ensure consistent reliability <b>and</b> proper operation, <b>protective</b> relay equipment must be evaluated and tested. The importance of the relay evaluation issue is linked to capability to test the relays and relaying systems using very accurate waveform representation of a fault event. The purpose of testing protective relays is to ensure correct operation of the relay for all possible power system conditions and disturbances. To fulfill this purpose, relay testing in varying network configurations and with different fault types is required. There are a variety of options that have different performance potentials and implementation constraints. Use of digital simulators to test protective relays has proven to be an invaluable mean to evaluate relay performance under realistic conditions. This thesis describes a new methodology that attempts to improve the existing practices in testing relays by using advanced digital simulator hardware, different software packages for network modeling, and new software tools for generating and replaying test waveforms. Various types of microprocessor relays are tested and evaluated through the set of scenarios. New methodology that combines different software packages to facilitate particular testing objectives is applied...|$|R

5000|$|The Sultan {{appealed to}} the Great Powers, a {{coalition}} of European nations that had taken {{an interest in the}} Greek revolution. When the Moslems destroyed the Christian quarter of Khania, the capital of Crete, a city of 23,000, British and French marines secured the city, setting up a neutral zone. Shortly after, they secured other cities in the same way. King George sent a fleet containing an occupation force under Prince George. He was warned that a blockade of Athens might ensue, but he sent a reply refusing all measures of the powers, stating that he would not [...] "abandon the Cretan people," [...] and subsequently attacking Khania with the Cretan Christians. The attacking force was driven off with naval gunfire. The Greek army was given six days to leave the island, which they did. The Ottoman army was then ordered to concentrate in [...] "fortified places which are at present occupied by the European detachments" [...] so that they could be <b>guarded</b> <b>and</b> kept in <b>protective</b> custody. For the time being all parties complied. Greece and Turkey, however, resolved the Balkans issue in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, an Ottoman victory. The Great Powers: England, France, Italy, and Russia, however, did not allow the Ottomans to exploit their victory in the Cretan conflict. Crete would remain in the Ottoman Empire, but it would be governed autonomously under their protectorate. A new Constitution was drawn up.|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} rarely {{investigated}} {{the association between}} improvements on dynamic risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors for violence during forensic psychiatric treatment and reduced recidivism after discharge. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of treatment progress in risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors on violent recidivism. For a sample of 108 discharged forensic psychiatric patients pre- and posttreatment assessments of risk (HCR- 20) <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors (SAPROF) were compared. Changes were related to violent recidivism at different follow-up times after discharge. Improvements on risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors during treatment showed good predictive validity for abstention from violence for short- (1 year) as well as long-term (11 years) follow-up. This study demonstrates {{the sensitivity of the}} HCR- 20 and the SAPROF to change and shows improvements on dynamic risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors are associated with lower violent recidivism long after treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{influence}} of traditional risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors for drug use on six different popular drugs on a population that is primarily Black and Latino between the ages of 16 and 24. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the relative importance of risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> indexes, <b>and</b> their interaction, in predicting drug use. Findings suggested: (a) traditional risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors, as well as situationally specific factors such as gang involvement, predicted drug use; and(b) the relative contribution of risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors toward explained variances differs substantially among the drug outcomes. Thus, risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors may be operating differently for different drugs, indicating that more research is needed into the meanings associated with the use of particular drugs and the factors that may make youth vulnerable to some drugs but not others...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has illustrated {{the importance of}} risk and protectivefactors on offending. The current study examines survey data from a sample of 81 offenders and 81 nonoffenders residing in Wuhan, China, in 1991 / 92 {{to determine how the}} accumulation of risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors in various domains differentiates offenders from nonoffenders. Specifically, we examine the importance of multiple causation and cumulative effects of risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors as they apply in a Chinese context. Results suggest that the risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factor approach often used in studies of western offending also holds promise in studies of Chinese offending. Specifically, our findings support the importance of examining multiple causation and cumulative effects of risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors as related to offending. The findings also suggest that the risk <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> factors found to be important in China may be somewhat different to those identified through studies conducted in the West, illustrating the impor-tance of recognising historical and cultural context in the risk and protec-tive factor paradigm...|$|R
