40|$|Adrenal {{epithelioid}} angiosarcoma is {{an extremely}} rare tumor. Even if such tumors are very aggressive, a long survival may occasionally be observed after an adrenal <b>ectomy.</b> A 70 -year-old woman suffering from persistent right flank pain showed a 5 -cm right adrenal mass plus a 2 -cm liver mass at the radiologic workup, and both were suspected of being malignant. No adrenal hypersecretion was demonstrated. During an explorative median laparotomy the right adrenal gland with the whole periadrenal tissue and locoregional lymph nodes was removed. A histological examination revealed an adrenal angiosarcoma. The resection margin was tumor-free with no lymph node infiltration. The liver mass {{turned out to be}} a cistobiliary adenoma. Since no distant metastases were observed, no adjuvant chemotherapy was performed. After an 18 -month follow-up the patient is still well with no sign of a relapse.

40|$|The {{bilateral}} <b>ectomy</b> of the {{olfactory bulb}} in {{rats and mice}} is an accepted animal model of depression. Because of its good predictive validity {{it is used to}} develop new antidepressants and to prove their effectiveness. After the olfactory bulbectomy, the animals show a certain pattern of changes in behaviour and in neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroimmunological parameters. The leading parameter for the changes of behaviour in these animals is the locomotoric hyperactivity in the brightly illuminated open field test. The neurotrophin hypothesis of depression postulates that the signal cascade of neurotrophic factors is disturbed. Particularly BDNF is given a prominent role in the following. It is known that BDNF appears broadly distributed in the brain and that it is of importance for the differentiation and survival of neurons. Several studies show that the Depressive Episode is accompanied by a down regulation of the BDNF levels, by disturbances in the plasticity and by reductions in the hippocampus volume. Animal experiments have been used to attempt to prove the connection between depression and the neurotrophin signal cascade. The results of previous investigations are conflicting and do not allow any certain conclusions to be drawn. The purpose of this work has been to analyse the concentrations of the neurotrophins BDNF and NGF in the brains of olfactory bulbectomized mice used as an animal model of depression for the first time. The success of the bulbectomy is verified by the examination of the locomotion. In five different brain regions that are seen as relevant for depression - hippocampus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, striatum and parietal cortex - we investigated the levels of the two neurotrophins - BDNF and NGF - in mice with bilateral <b>ectomy</b> of the olfactory bulb and in control animals. For the determination of the protein concentrations we used a highly sensitive two site ELISA. 16 days after the olfactory bulbectomy, we measured higher BDNF levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex and higher NGF levels in the hippocampus in bulbectomized mice compared to sham mice. Thereby, the BDNF concentrations were augmented in two of the brain regions in the bulbectomized mice, in contrast to the initial assumption. The results in this animal experiment do not give any support for the neurotrophin hypothesis. Reasons for this increase in neurotrophin levels could be, among other things, reparation processes after lesions, hyperactivity during night, reduced breakdown and transport of the protein or the loss of the smelling sense and the associated learning process to reorientate itself. The olfactory bulbectomy in mice has been proposed as an animal model of chronic psychomotoric agitated depression. With respect to the endophenotype concept of depression BDNF does not {{play a significant role in}} the pathophysiology of depression in this animal model of depression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveLaparoscopic {{approach}} {{should be}} offered for most patients requiring colectomy, {{as it is a}} safe procedure, associated with shorter hospitalization, better cosmetic results, and does not affect negatively the oncological outcomes of patients with colon cancer. However, there is no consistent data on the safety of laparoscopic surgery training during residency. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether or not the resident par- ticipation in laparoscopic colectomy affected the postoperative outcomes. MethodsThe database of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Im- provement Program (ACS-NSQIP) was searched for patients undergoing laparoscopic col- <b>ectomies</b> between 2005 and 2007. We excluded patients with no data regarding whether or not there was a resident participation in the operation. The study population was divided into 2 groups (resident and nonresident), according to residents participation in the surgi- cal procedure. Perioperative variables and postoperative complications were compared be- tween groups. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the association between postoperative complications and resident participation in the operation. ResultsThe search yielded 5, 912 patients with a median age of 63 years. Of these, 3, 112 (53 %) were female and 3. 887 (66 %) had a resident involved in their operation. The resident group had a significantly longer mean operative time (163 ± 64 min vs 138 ± 58 min, p < 0. 0001). Other variables did not differ significantly between groups. Moreover, multivari- ate analysis showed no association between resident participation and the occurrence of postoperative complications.

40|$|The present {{studies were}} carried out to assess the {{function}} of the vagus nerve in the release of extragastic gastrin. A Clinical Studies 1. In patients with cancer of the stomach, the serum gastrin levels were determined before and 1, 10, 20 and 30 days, respectively, after distal and total gastrectomics. In patients who undergone pancreatoduodenectomies due to cancer of the pancreatic head, the above measurements were also performed. Only in cases of total gastrectomy, was a truncal vagotomy done. 2. In healthy men and in patirnts who had undergone distal, proximal or total gastrectomies, or pancreatoduodenectomies about one month previously, the serum gastrin levels were determined before and 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, respectively, after the intravenous administration of regular insulin, 0. 25 u/kg. Truncal vagotomies had been performed in the patients who had proximal and total gastr <b>ectomies.</b> 3. Results. i) After removal of the antrum, a compensatory hyperfunction of the extragastric gastrin system developed more rapidly, markedly in non-vagotomized patients (distal gastrectomy) than in vagotomized ones (total gastrectomy) ⅱ) In spite of the preservation of the vagus nerves, the serum gastrin levels which had fallen markedly immediately after pancreatoduodenectomy, i. e., removal of the antrum and duodenum, remained almost unchanged thereafter. ⅲ) After hypoglycemic vagal stimulation, regardless of whether the antrum was present or not, when the vagus preserved, a considerable increase in serum gastrin was found. ⅳ) The vagal stimulation induced by the insulin injection produced little changes in the serum gastrin levels after pancreatoduodenectomy. B. Experimental Studies 1. In dogs, the following procedures were performed : ⅰ) No gastrectomy. ⅱ) Distal hemi-gastrectomy. The gastic and duodenal stumps were closed separately. The animals in this group were subjected to the experiment one hour postoperatively. ⅲ) The same operation as No, ⅱ However, the gastic and duodenal stumps were anastomosed. The animals in this group were subjected to the experiment three months postperatively. The bilateral vagal trunks were cut off and both distal stumps were simulated for 20 minutes by electrical square waves with a frequency of 50 Hz and a voltage of 15 V. The serum gastri levels were determined before and 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, respectively, after the vagal stimulation. 2. The following operations were also performed : ⅰ) ⅱ) and ⅲ) were the same as above. ⅳ) Truncal vagotomy. The animals in this group were subjected to the experiment one hour postoperatively. ⅴ) Distal gastrin with truncal vagotomy. The animals in this group were subjected to the experiment one hour postoperatively. Hypoglycemic vagal stimulation was induced by the intravenous injection of regular insulin, 0. 25 u/kg. The serum gastrin levels were determined before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, respectively after injection. 3 Results. ⅰ) Regardless of whether the antrum was present or not, the serum gastrin levels rose considerably during the entire of electrical vagal stimulation but fell immediately after cessation of the stimulation. Throughout the experiment, the absolute values of the serum gastrin were highest in the group with no gastrectomy (ⅰ), next highest, in the three months after distal hemi-gastrectomy group (ⅲ) and lowest, in the one hour after surgery group (ⅱ). However, the maximum changing rates expressed as percentages of the pre-stimulation values were similar. ⅱ) Without truncal vagotomy, insulim stimulation produced considerable changes in the serum gastrin levels, regardless of the existence of the antrum, but with vagotomy, few changes occurred. The absolute values and changing rates of serum gastrin were higher three months after distal gastrectomy than one hour after the same operation. Conclusion. It was demonstrated clinically as well as experimentally that the vagus nerves assist a compensatory hyperfunction of the extragastic gastrin system after removal of the antrum. It was also shown that vagal stimulation promotes the secretion of extragastric gastrin...|$|R
40|$|An unusual {{complication}} following partial lateral splint bone <b>ectomy</b> is described. Four {{weeks following}} the surgery, the horse {{fell onto the}} surgery site and {{from that point on}} showed a lameness on that limb. Despite a positive local anesthesia, the re-evaluation did not reveal any abnormal ultrasonographic and radiographic findings. The local steroid injection reduced the lameness only slightly. The clinical evaluation at our clinic revealed the potential presence of a fracture in the lateropalmar cortex. The horse was scheduled for surgery and the special fluoroscopic examination prior to surgery confirmed the tentative diagnosis. The origin of the fracture {{turned out to be the}} horizontal saw cut in the lateropalmar cortex of McIII, which occurred accidentally during the osteotomy of the fractured splint bone. The fall of the horse onto the partially amputated splint bone in association with the horizontal cut in the lateropalmar cortex of McIII, resulted in this avulsion fracture associated with significant pain. The splint bone and the fracture were stabilized with the help of a 9 -hole 3. 5 mm DCP applied over the splint bone and with the screws traversing the entire lateropalmar cortex of McIII. The horse responded positively to this treatment and 10 weeks postoperatively the plate was removed. An additional reason for this relatively early plate removal was the presence of an additional suspensory problem, which demanded a prolonged recovery period...|$|E
40|$|Posterior fossa {{arteriovenous}} malformations {{are rare}} entities and treatment modalities technically challenging. In recent years new therapeutic options have emerged through microsurgical and endovascular means. Based {{on a series}} of six cases we describe combined interdisciplinary treatment strategies and report the outcome in a midterm follow-up interval of 12 months. Clinical case data were collected during acute phase and follow-up including standardized angiographic control intervals during follow-up and assessment of the outcome. Treatment options included endovascular techniques as well as microsurgical techniques. All reported cases had SAH based on ruptured flow-related aneurysms in posterior fossa AVM; three out of six had multiple aneurysms. In one case we observed a de novo formation of two flow-associated distal aneurysms in an interval of ten years. Two patients were treated only endovascularly, one patient only surgically and three patients with combined methods. Five out of six patients had a good outcome (GOS 4 or 5). One died in the acute phase. Infratentorial AVMs are rare but characterized by a high risk of rupture and SAH, especially in conjunction with flow related aneurysms, which are predictors of poor outcome. The anatomic conditions of the posterior fossa may lead quickly to life-threatening complications due to mass effects. The present study indicates that treatment strategies in the acute phase should focus on flow-related aneurysms, followed by an elective AVM embolization and <b>ectomy</b> whenever possible. An experienced interdisciplinary team and the combination of techniques contribute to a reduction of complications and to a better outcome...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that feline mammary hyperplasia is related to progesterone-induced mammary growth hormone (GH) expression. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the expression of GH, growth hormone receptor (GHR), insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and the progesterone receptor (PR) in fibroadenomatous hyperplasia (FAH) and mammary carcinomas of cats using QPCR analysis. A downregulation of GHR (p= 0, 008), IGF-I (p= 0, 001) and PR (p= 0, 000) was found in the group of animals with carcinomas compared to animals with FAH. The effects of progestin treatment or removal of the endogenous progesterone source by ovary(hyster) <b>ectomy</b> on the gene expression were also analysed. Animals with FAH who were treated with progestins showed an upregulation of GH (p= 0, 028) in comparison to animals with FAH wich were not treated. Intact queens showed an upregulation of GHR (p= 0, 013) and PR (p= 0, 038). Finally the influence of the breed was analysed showing that Maine Coons had a higher expression of the reference gene β 2 microglobulin (B 2 M) (p= 0, 026), GH (p= 0, 044) and GHR (p= 0, 029) in compared to all breeds combined. Additional eight FAH tissues were immunohistological analysed for the progesterone receptor and compared to the QPCR data. All eight tissue samples were positive for PR, but they differed in location and intensity. The number of positive nuclei and their intensity was found to be the best way of comparing the IHC results with the QPCR data. Striking finding was that the positive nuclei were bigger and rounder in animals who had received progestins. This is interesting since progesterone and progestins normally have an autorepressing effect on the progesterone receptor expression. Further research is necessary to determine why this occurs. In conclusion can be said that hormones {{play an important role in}} the etiology of FAH considering the results found in this study...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoid hormones are {{important}} for vital functions and act to modulate inflammatory and immune responses. In contrast to other hormonal systems no endogenous mediators have been identified that can directly counter-regulate their potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Glucocorticoids are known {{to interfere with the}} ability of the macrophage not only to induce and amplify an immune response but also to inhibit macrophage inflammatory effector functions. Although the actual immunocompetence of animals undergoing endocrine gland <b>ectomy</b> has never been directly studied, {{there is no doubt that}} adrenal hormones are deeply involved in the development and maintenance of the immunitory functions and this may in turn influence the inflammatory reaction. To study the effect of endogenous glucocorticoids on the functions of rat peritoneal macrophages and induction of humoral immune response we observed some of the rat peritoneal macrophage effector functions, provided that endogenous glucocorticoids are depleted by adrenalectomy. The mean phagocytic index (PI) of control macrophage (Mf) is increased from 23, 825 ± 427 to 31, 895 ± 83 after adrenalectomy (P£ 0. 001). Intracellular killing capacity in control cell is 82 % which is found to be 73 % in case of adrenalectomised cell (p< 0. 05). The amount of nitric oxide released from control Mf 20. 25 ± 1 mM following adrenalectomy shows the amount of nitric oxide release was 18. 25 mM (p£ 0. 01). The percentage of DNA fragmentation in control Mf was 68. 82 ± 4 which was reduced to 56. 76 ± 1 after adrenalectomy (p£ 0. 01). In sheep red blood cell (SRBC) immunised and adrenalectomised animal, agglutination titre was obtained at lowest antibody concentration (1 : 128) whereas serum from SRBC immunised normal rats showed early agglutination (1 : 32). Endogenous glucocorticoid depleted rats show enhanced phagocytic capacity, antibody raising capacity as well as on the other hand adrenal hormone insufficiency reduces the intracellular killing capacity, nitric oxide (NO) release, improper cell maturation and heightens the probability of infection. These observations demonstrate a counter-regulatory system via glucocorticoid that functions to control inflammatory and immune responses...|$|E
40|$|Background: According to the 2004 WHO classification, thyroid {{papillary}} microcarcinoma (PMC) {{is defined}} as a papillary tumour with a diameter of maximum 1 cm, discovered incidentally. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the clinical and pathological features as well as the treatment of PMC discovered following thyroidectomies for benign conditions. Material and method. A clinical retrospective study was carried out on a series of 17 cases of MCP, accounting for 1. 22 % of a total of 1393 resections for benign thyroid diseases, performed in the III-rd Surgical Unit, during 1990 - 2005. Results. Most of the cases (12) were operated for uni- or multinodular goiter, Graves’ disease (3) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (2). The median age was 42. 1 yrs (range 26 - 60 yrs), and with the exception of one case, all were women. The median size of the tumours was 0. 5 cm (range 0. 2 - 1 cm). Multifocality confined to one lobe was diagnosed in one case, whereas bilateral PMC were present in 3 cases. Invasion of the capsule was present in 2 cases and central compartment lymph node involvement was confirmed by pathology report in one case. No distant metastases were recorded. Total or near total thyroidectomy was performed in 13 patients. In 4 cases of solitary nodules, an initial lob(isthmus) <b>ectomy</b> was followed by completion thyroidectomy in 3 cases. Except of the patient who refused totalisation, all the others were postoperatively treated with radioactive iodine and supressive hormone therapy. One patient died in the early postoperative period, due to respiratory complications generated by myasthenia gravis asociated with Graves’ disease. Postoperative morbidity consisted of transient reccurent laryngeal nerve palsy in one case. No disease-related deaths nor reccurences were recorded during the follow-up period (median 28. 8 months (range 12 - 72)). Discussions and conclusion. In our series, the incidence of PMC (1 %) is smaller than reported by literature data (2 – 24 %). Although with an excelent prognosis, in a small number of cases, local and distant metastases may occur, with reccurence and death. Nowadays, total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation seems to be preffered by most of the centers but, in the absence of prospective randomised studies, no consensus is yet achieved regarding the management of PMC...|$|E
40|$|Using male rats of Wistar strain, {{studies were}} made on the {{influences}} of the thyroid and thymic systems upon the changes of weight and histochemical findings of the prostatic gland, testicle, seminal vesicle and adrenal gland. Simultaneously, effects of sexual hormones which added to the thyroid and thymic agents were also observed. The results are summarized as follows. 1) Observ a tions of short duration (3 and 5 weeks) in the thyroid groups revealed {{a slight increase in}} weight of the prostatic gland, a decrease in ACP and an increase in ALP following thyroidectomy or administration of MTU, and a decrease in weight of the prostatic gland and increases in ACP and RNA with administration of thyroid powder. The results indicated that supression of thyroid function yields an increase in weight and hypofunction of the prostatic gland while hyperthyroidism makes a decrease in weight and hyperfunction of the prostatic gland. 2) Obse r vations of long duration (3 and 5 months) in the thyroid groups showed an increase in weight and decrease in function of the prostatic gland following administration of MTU, while a decrease in weight and increases in Zn and SD of the prostatic gland after administration of thyroid powder. However when the grade of suppression or acceleration of the thyroid function is exceeded, both of weight and function of the proststic gland were decreased. 3) Administration of sexual hormones in association with experimental thyroid disfunctions resulted intenser effects of the sexual hormones upon the prostatic gland. 4) In thyroid groups, weight of the testicle shoWed a slight increas e after thyroidectomy and administration of MTU or thyroid powder. The level of SD in seminal vesicle the yielded decreases after thyroidectomy or administration of MTU and an increase after administration of thyroid powder. Furthermore, with thyroidectomy or with administration of MTU, increases in weight, amount of Sudan III stainable substance and 17 KS of the adrenal gland were demonstrated during short observations period, while decreases in these values were shown during long observation period. With administration of thyroid powder, despite a slight decrease in weight of the adrenal gland, Sudan 'III stainable substance and 17 KS revealed increases in short observation period and decreases in long observation period, making a diphasic pattern. 5) Following thymectomy, the prostatic gland showed an increase in weight and hyperfunction with increases of Zn and SD. Administration of thymic agent resulted decreases in weight and function of the prostatic gland with decreases of RNA, Zn and SD. 6) Administration of male or female sexual hormones in association with thy m <b>ectomy</b> or treatment with thymic agent demonstrated a more intense effects of sexual hormones upon gonads in the cases of thymectomy with sexual hormonal administration than the cases of simultaneous treatment with thymic agent and sexual hormones. 7) Weight of the testicle increased after thymectomy a n d decreased with administration of thymic agent. The level of SD in the seminal vesicle coincided with that of in the prostatic gland.
