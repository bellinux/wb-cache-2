Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave a positive review of the film, praising the [...] "nerve-rackingly delicate plot" [...] and the [...] "most elaborate roles" [...] of Steiger and his co-star, Edward G.

Steiger's performance was so convincing that, after the film was released, he received a call from a psychiatric institution asking him to attend one of their board meetings. The Mark was followed by a role in the European film production of World in My Pocket alongside Nadja Tiller. Steiger increasingly played in films in Italy and France during this period. Not only did he believe he had greater credibility and esteem as an actor in Europe, but he approved of the more relaxed filming schedule prevalent there at that time.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{ordinances}} {{is normally}} reserved for urgent matters, or for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums <b>in</b> <b>French</b> <b>Francs</b> to Euros {{in the various}} laws in force in France). There is also a practice to use ordinances to transpose European Directives into French law, to avoid late transposition of Directive, which is often happening and is criticized by the EU Commission. Ordinances are also used to codify law into codes, to rearrange them {{for the sake of}} clarity without substantially modifying them. They are also sometimes used to push controversial legislation through, such as when Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin created new forms of work contracts in 2005. The use of ordinances in such contexts is then criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament. It must be said, however, that since the National Assembly can dismiss the government through a motion of censure, the government necessarily relies on a majority in Parliament, and this majority would be likely to adopt the controversial law anyway.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{about a dozen}} AFN {{stations}} operated, with AFN Orléans, as {{the studio}} control station. The network broadcast music, shows, and news relayed from AFN Frankfurt, locally produced shows and other features aimed at the American soldiers and their families stationed in France. In particular, a whole team of reporters and technicians was sent to Le Mans, France, to report the 24-hour auto race, {{at a time when}} Ford was doing its best to beat the Ferraris, and finally succeeded. AFN France broadcast in 50-watts, frequency modulated transmitters purchased from a French manufacturer (TRT), type OZ 305. The network employed a technical director, a program director, several military American broadcast professionals, and some French studio operators, record librarians, secretaries and maintenance technicians. The Frankfurt network programming was received, then re-fed from AFN Orléans studios to another studio-equipped affiliate, AFN Poitiers, and its slave transmitters via modulation lines rented from the French postmaster department. AFN Poitiers, based at Aboville Caserne, Poitiers, France, home of an Army logistical command and a major Communication Zone Signal Corps agency, served Army depots and installations in Southwestern France with locally originated programs and network feeds from AFN Orlean via Frankfurt, Germany. It was the only other studio station affiliate of AFN Orleans because of the large American military presence and it's resident Department of Defense dorm school for children of American military and civilian families assigned to Poitiers, and the American installations located throughout Southwestern France. Children living in outlying American military installations and communities commuted to Poitiers once a week for daily classes and departed for home by bus and train. AFN France was dismantled in 1967, when U.S. forces left France due to the French government's decision of President (General) Charles de Gaulle to withdraw its forces from NATO's military command. The French employees were dismissed but were granted a severance pay (<b>in</b> <b>French</b> <b>francs</b> and taxable) of one month per year of service, paid by the U.S. Army to the French government, in dollars (all the French employees were managed by a specially created service: le Bureau d'Aide aux Armées Alliées AAA).|$|E

Steiger played the role of a destroyer commander in the large ensemble cast of The Longest Day, which included John Wayne, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Sean Connery and Henry Fonda. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had had a face lift, which Burton thought made him look like [...] "one half of a naked ass-hole". The following year, Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal, in Francesco Rosi's Italian production, Hands over the City (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted [...] "a rich interpreter of great capacity" [...] in the part of the land developer.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} an "Information SuperHighway " has {{attracted}} considerable attention. It offers the possibility to access information {{from around the world}} in support of many important applications in areas such as finance, manufacturing, and transportation (e. g., global risk management, integrated supply chain management, global in-transit visibility.) Unfortunately, there are significant challenges to be overcome. One particular problem is context interchange, which {{can be thought of as}} dealing with the "on- and off-ramps " of the Information SuperHighway. Each source of information and potential receiver of that information may operate with a different context. A context is the collection of implicit assumptions about the context definition (i. e., meaning) and context characteristics (i. e., quality) of the information. When the information moves from one context to another, it may be misinterpreted (e. g., sender expressed the price <b>in</b> <b>French</b> <b>francs,</b> receiver assumed that it meant US dollars.) This paper describes various forms of context challenges and examples of potential context mediation services, such as data semantics acquisition, data quality attributes, and evolving semantics and quality, that can mitigate the problem. 1...|$|E
