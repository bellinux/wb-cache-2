When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes <b>disconnected</b> from one bogie, and for one hour if <b>disconnected</b> from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} by 1919, M-76 initially terminated at Roscommon. It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s. A second, <b>disconnected,</b> segment {{was added to}} the highway in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, both the <b>disconnected</b> section and the Kalkaska–Grayling were added to M-72. M-76 was converted in stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the last segment was completed, the number was removed from the highway, and the freeway was added to I-75.|$|E

5|$|Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre's steam trains {{run on the}} sidings {{which were}} <b>disconnected</b> from the network in 1967, the station still has a working railway line passing through it, used for {{occasional}} special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre. Regular freight trains are mainly landfill trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former brick pits at Calvert.|$|E
50|$|Electric power {{distribution}} systems include circuit breakers to <b>disconnect</b> power {{in case of}} a fault, but to maximize reliability, they wish to <b>disconnect</b> the smallest possible portion of the network.

50|$|The Jeep Cherokee can be {{equipped}} with three different four-wheel drive systems: Active Drive I, Active Drive II, and Active Drive Lock. All of these systems come with Jeep's Selec-Terrain traction control system and rear-axle <b>disconnect</b> feature. The rear axle <b>disconnect</b> feature, a first for Compact SUV, <b>disconnects</b> the rear-axle when four-wheel drive is not needed. This lowers parasitic drivetrain load; which improves fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The National Electric Code {{states that}} a safety/service <b>disconnect</b> must be {{installed}} {{within sight of}} serviceable equipment. The safety <b>disconnect</b> ensures the equipment can be isolated and there is less chance of someone turning the power back on if {{they can see the}} work going on. These safety <b>disconnects</b> usually have multiple places for locks so more than one person can work on equipment safely.|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} isolation <b>disconnect</b> {{was developed}} for component replacement in serviced liquid and gaseous spacecraft systems. Initially a survey of feasible concepts was made to determine the optimum method for fluid isolation, sealing techniques, coupling concepts, and foolproofing techniques. The top concepts were then further evaluated, including the fabrication of a semifunctional model. After all tradeoff analyses were made, a final configuration was designed and fabricated for development testing. This resulted in a 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 inch) line and 12. 7 mm (1 / 2 inch) line positive isolation <b>disconnect,</b> each unit consisting of two coupled <b>disconnect</b> halves, each capable of fluid isolation with essentially zero clearance between them for zero leakage upon <b>disconnect</b> half disengagement. An interlocking foolproofing technique was incorporated that prevents uncoupling of <b>disconnect</b> halves prior to fluid isolation...|$|R

40|$|Emergency {{situations}} are by their nature {{difficult to manage}} and success in such situations is often highly dependent on effective team coordination. Breakdowns in team coordination can lead to significant disruption to an operational response. Breakdowns in coordination were explored in three large-scale bushfires in Australia: the Kilmore East fire, the Wangary fire, and the Canberra Firestorm. Data from these fires were analysed using a top-down and bottom-up qualitative analysis technique. Forty-four breakdowns in coordinated decision making were identified, which yielded 83 <b>disconnects</b> grouped into three main categories: operational, informational and evaluative. <b>Disconnects</b> were specific in- stances where differences in understanding existed between team members. The reasons why discon- nects occurred were largely consistent across the three sets of data. In some cases multiple <b>disconnects</b> occurred in a temporal manner, which suggested some evidence of <b>disconnects</b> creating states that were conducive to the occurrence of further <b>disconnects.</b> In terms of resolution, evaluative <b>disconnects</b> were nearly always resolved however operational and informational <b>disconnects</b> were rarely resolved effec- tively. The exploratory data analysis and discussion presented here represents the first systematic research {{to provide information about}} the reasons why breakdowns occur in emergency management and presents an account of how team processes can act to disrupt coordination and the operational response...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of medium}} duty 300 psi fluid <b>disconnects</b> for orbital {{servicing}} was demonstrated {{to be both}} practical and technically feasible. A prototype <b>disconnect</b> was designed and tested, based on criteria formulated from a survey of expected usage requirements for orbital servicing concepts. Testing involved the comparison of three seal materials (EPR, Neoprene and Teflon), and two test media (helium and Freon 21), and was conducted over a temperature range of - 150 F to + 225 F. Results indicate low helium leakage (10 to the - 4 power sccs) and extremely low engagement forces (56 lb sub f). Testing was also performed on a new seal design. Design concepts for a cryogenic <b>disconnect</b> and a high pressure <b>disconnect</b> were investigated. Results of an industry survey for usable orbital servicing <b>disconnects</b> and areas needing attention in future studies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{space shuttle}} design {{required}} {{development of a}} large, 0. 43 m nominal diameter separable <b>disconnect</b> for the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant lines at the orbiter to external tank interface. The <b>disconnect</b> provides for shutoff of the propellant flow area by simultaneous action of two rotary flapper valves (orbiter and external tank) prior to <b>disconnect</b> separation. In the case of pneumatic system failure, the rotary flapper valves are closed automatically through mechanical interlocking linkage during <b>disconnect</b> separation. The mechanism must meet requirements while accommodating changes in bearing clearances and linkage geometry over a wide temperature range from ambient to 20. 37 K. The mechanical design of the separable <b>disconnect,</b> kinematics of the drive mechanism, and the analysis and test methods used to verify proper operation and qualification for the space shuttle dynamic environments are presented...|$|R
5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been <b>disconnected</b> first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra <b>disconnected</b> the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the {{electrical}} power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and <b>disconnected</b> from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E
