The main duty of the GLP monitoring authority is to monitor compliance with <b>GLP</b> <b>Principles</b> by conducting laboratory inspections and study audits. The OECD principles of GLP were primarily developed to promote the quality and validity of test data {{used to determine the}} safety of chemicals and chemical products.|$|E

40|$|Summary. the Organisation for {{economic}} cooperation and Development (OecD) principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) were originally developed for application to animal-based toxicology stud-ies. On the other hand, more and more studies involving in vitro test systems are performed to produce data on the safety of chemicals with respect to human health and the environment. therefore, national legislation usually requires that the in vitro studies are conducted in compliance with the <b>GLP</b> <b>principles.</b> Furthermore, developments in the area of toxicogenomics, toxicoproteomics, toxicometabonomics and various high throughput screening techniques will also enhance the importance of in vitro methodologies for safety testing. the OecD principles of GLP require that safety studies, independent of their type, are planned, conducted, recorded, reported, and archived {{in a way that they}} can be inspected by the GLP monitoring authorities and scientifically evaluated by the receiving authorities. Some critical aspects and pitfalls are discussed as regards the proper application and interpretation of the <b>GLP</b> <b>principles</b> for the organisation and management of in vitro studies. Organisational charts and responsibilities of test facili-ties (tFs) involved in single or multisite studies are sometimes dysfunctioning because there is a lack of traceability in reporting and communication lines. Manipulation of cell and tissue cultures of different test systems should be separated and performed under aseptic conditions to prevent cross-contamina...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Bachelor’s degree thesis in Business Administration School of Economics and Management, University of Växjö, FEN 330, Spring 2006 Authors: Malin Jansson and Mirja Wynn-Williams Supervisor: Stig Malm How does Good Laboratory Practice improve quality? Background: The quality {{systems that}} steer {{manufacturing}} of pharmaceutical {{products from the}} testing phase to commercial manufacturing are the national and international regulatory frameworks and legislation. Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) is a quality system concerned with the organizational process and {{the conditions under which}} non-clinical health and environmental safety studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, archived and reported. In Sweden the Medical Products Agency monitors and regulates compliance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice. Aim: The aim of our thesis is to explore the reasons why companies/laboratories adopt Good Laboratory Practice. We shall do this by identifying {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} adopting <b>GLP</b> <b>principles</b> for companies/laboratories, and how quality is improved by adopting <b>GLP</b> <b>principles.</b> We have summarized our aim in one principal question: How does Good Laboratory Practice function as a tool for quality improvement? Limitations: We will focus on GLP, and this thesis will not consider other Good Practice procedures such as Good Manufacturing Practice or Good Clinical Practice. Only laboratories in Sweden monitored by the Medical Products Agency are targeted in the empirical part of this work. Method: Literature research and interviews with GLP contact persons listed by MPA. Results and conclusions: Though costumers’ needs and legislation seem to be the motivations for companies deciding to comply with GLP, quality improvement seems to be the biggest advantage of validation. Proposal for further research: Do laboratory assistants and technical employees differ from management in their experience and views on GLP...|$|E
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA; 4, 4 -isopropylidene diphenol) is a {{chemical}} intermediate used {{primarily in the}} production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate products. BPA has been identified in surface waters and, hence, {{has been the subject of}} consider-able research into its potential effects on aquatic organisms. Available literature on the aquatic toxicity of BPA was reviewed for quality against European Union TGD and Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development <b>GLP</b> <b>principles.</b> From this review, studies of suitable quality covering numerous ecologically relevant endpoints were identified to evaluate the survival, growth, and reproductive success of aquatic organisms exposed to BPA. Those studies yielded approximately 70 no observed effect concentrations (ranging from 16 to 3640 µg/L) and lowest observed effect concentrations (160 to 11, 000 µg/L) that were considered in this weight of evidence assessment. Across all data, adverse effects on survival, growth, and repro-duction occurred only at concentrations of 160 µg/L and above. Secondary bio-chemical (e. g., vitellogenin induction) and morphological (e. g., gonad histology) data provide insight into mechanisms of action, but do not correlate with apical endpoints related to survival, growth, and reproduction. Comparing the weight of the evidence of the aquatic toxicity data that showed chronic effects at 160 µg/L and higher with typical surface water concentrations in the range of 0. 001 to 0. 10 µg/ L, BPA is unlikely to cause adverse effects on aquatic populations or ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of studies {{performed}} in Greece, {{in order to establish}} withdrawal time of sheep milk for some commonly used antimicrobial drugs. Several studies have been performed to establish milk withdrawal time for the following veterinary medicinal products, commonly used in the therapeutics of sheep: lincomycin, spectinomycin, procaine penicillin G,dihydrostreptomycin, kanamycin,oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfadiazine, albendazole. For oxytetracycline, two pharmaceutical forms were tested, specifically long-acting injectable solution and spray. For albendazole, the pharmaceutical form of oral suspension was tested. For all the other antimicrobials, the pharmaceutical form of injectable solution was tested. The animal phase of all the trials was performed at the Veterinary Faculty of the University of Thessaly. Each product was administered at the highest recommended dose and the frequency currently licensed for administration to sheep. Subsequently, either liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry was used under <b>GLP</b> <b>principles</b> and as required each time, in order to establish residues of each antibiotic in milk. Most of the analytical work was carried out at GLP accredited laboratories. In each case, limit of detection and limit of quantification for each antibiotic tested were appropriately calculated. For calculation and proposal of a withdrawal period, the legally established minimum residue levels of each antibiotic and their concentrations detected in sheep milk were taken into account. The proposed withdrawal periods are as follows: lincomycin and spectinomycin inj. sol. : 4 milkings, procaine penicillin G and dihydrostreptomycin inj. sol. : 5 milkings, dihydrostreptomycin inj. sol. : 5 milkings, kanamycin inj. sol. : 4 milkings, oxytetracycline long-acting inj. sol. : 16 milkings, oxytetracycline spray: 0 milkings, trimethoprim and sulfadiazine inj. sol. : 7 milkings, albendazole or. susp. : 7 milkings after last administration of each test product. The above results provide standards and will help veterinarians to use the various veterinary pharmaceutical products in the therapeutics of dairy ewes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
