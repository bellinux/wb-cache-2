40|$|Starting from Pliocene times, the Apulian {{foreland}} {{in southern}} Italy {{has undergone a}} flexural process underneath the Apennines thrust-fold belt. Mesozoic carbonate beds from the exposed Apulian forebulge are intensely dissected by systematic vertical joints striking parallel to the NW-trending flexure hinge. The sedimentary cover involved in the flexure consists of a 5. 5 km thick succession of Mesozoic-Cenozoic carbonate beds strongly interpenetrated along bedding surfaces and overlying Triassic anhydrites and dolomites. On the assumption of {{the applicability of the}} linear elastic theory, the flexural curve of the Apulian foreland is reconstructed by best fitting a set of data derived from logs of oil wells and referring to the height of the base of Pliocene sediments. A set of flexural parameters is obtained from the reconstructed flexural curve. By using these parameters in solving the flexure equations for the <b>fibre</b> <b>stress,</b> we obtained a flexure- related hinge-perpendicular <b>fibre</b> <b>stress</b> in the outer arc of the Apulian forebulge in excess of - 100 MPa. This value is far greater than the tensile strength of the exposed carbonate rocks. This result supports the hypothesis that the flexure-related <b>fibre</b> <b>stress</b> in the Apulian forebulge can have driven the initiation of the observed regional systematic joints. This model may be applied to any flexed foreland plate and constitutes an alternative to the classical model of elastic response of rocks to the variations of lithostatic loads through time that has been often invoked to explain sets of systematic joints over large areas of foreland regions...|$|E

40|$|Fibre {{orientation}} of myocardial wall plays {{a significant role}} in ventricular wall stress, which is assumed to be responsible for many cardiac mechanics, including ventricular remodelling, associated with heart failure. Previous studies, conducted to identify the effects of fibre orientation on left-ventricle (LV) diastolic mechanics, used only animal’s myocardium properties (no human data) and therefore, may not apply for predicting human cardiac mechanics. In the present study, computational modelling of LV diastole was carried out to investigate the effects of fibre orientation on LV end diastolic pressure volume relation (EDPVR) and wall stress distribution using subject-specific in vivo passive properties of human myocardium for two human hearts. Results indicated that LV inflation increased when fibres were aligned more towards LV longitudinal axis and the effect was more notable when the fibre angle was higher in endocardium than epicardium wall. Changes in fibre angle distribution considerably altered <b>fibre</b> <b>stress</b> distribution of LV wall and the changes were significant in anterior and lateral regions of equatorial and apical locations. Furthermore, the regions of high <b>fibre</b> <b>stress</b> from midwall to endocardium were gradually confined towards endocardium with the decrease in fibre angle. Such information will be useful for future studies/diagnoses of LV mechanics in normal and pathological conditions...|$|E

Recent studies have defined regulatory mechanisms that control <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> formation, placing the ROCK protein kinase at the centre of a complex signalling network controlling actomyosin contractility and <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> assembly. As we uncover the details of <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> construction, it is becoming clear that different categories of <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> exist.

40|$|Summary Rnd {{proteins}} are atypical Rho family {{proteins that}} do not hydrolyse GTP and are instead regulated by expression levels and post-translational modifications. Rnd 1 and Rnd 3 /RhoE induce loss of actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> and cell rounding in multiple cell types, whereas responses to Rnd 2 are more variable. Here we report the responses of endothelial cells to Rnd proteins. Rnd 3 induces a very transient decrease in <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> but subsequently stimulates a strong increase in <b>stress</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{in contrast to the}} reduction observed in other cell types. Rnd 2 also increases <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> whereas Rnd 1 induces a loss of <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> and weakening of cell–cell junctions. Rnd 3 does not act through any of its known signalling partners and does not need to associate with membranes to increase <b>stress</b> <b>fibres.</b> Instead, it acts by increasing RhoB expression, which is then required for Rnd 3 -induced <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> assembly. Rnd 2 also increases RhoB levels. These data indicate that the cytoskeletal response to Rnd 3 expression is dependent on cell type and context, and identify regulation of RhoB as a new mechanism for Rnd proteins to affect the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|For {{optoelectronic}} devices submicron precision {{is required}} to optimally couple the laser source with the optical fibre. Laser welding is used because of its inherent attributes of accuracy, strength, cleanliness and minimised heat affected zone and structural changes. Due to the rapid solidification of the welded parts post welding residual stresses occur {{which can lead to}} a post weld shift between the aligned components and can significantly reduce the light coupling efficiency. Submicron misalignment induced due to the welding process can result in significant power loss. This is a serious and common issue in the manufacture of optoelectronic components and affects production rates. The aim of this work is the development of a methodology that can estimate the residual stresses in the weld piece and to optimise the process by locating the optimal site for micro laser welding. The aim establishes the research question which was addressed by nine objectives. The first eight objectives are elements that comprise the Optoelectronic Packaging Interfaces for Sub-Micron Alignment (OPISA) project. The final objective is the dissemination of this work. Finite element models were developed and used with design of experiments (DoE) statistical technique. This was used to investigate how the key process parameters influence the resultant stress in the optical fibre and to develop a predictive surrogate model. The surrogate model was used with Monte Carlo simulations to determine the <b>fibre</b> <b>stress</b> variation when uncertainty and variation of the design variables are accounted for. The Monte Carlo simulations predicted <b>fibre</b> <b>stress</b> response values which were used to understand how the uncertainties of the input design variables propagate into uncertainty and variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>stress.</b> The surrogate model was used in a sensitivity and risk analysis. The capability analysis of the welding process was also investigated. The original finding of this work is the development of a methodology that fulfils the aim.

40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} studies have established that cells can sense the stiffness of underlying substrates and have quantified {{the effect of}} substrate stiffness on <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> formation, focal adhesion area, cell traction, and cell shape. In order to capture such behaviour, the current study couples a mixed mode thermodynamic and mechanical framework that predicts focal adhesion formation and growth with a material model that predicts <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> formation, contractility, and dissociation in a fully 3 D implementation. Simulations reveal that SF contractility plays {{a critical role in}} the substrate-dependent response of cells. Compliant substrates do not provide sufficient tension for <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> persistence, causing dissociation of <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> and lower focal adhesion formation. In contrast, cells on stiffer substrates are predicted to contain large amounts of dominant <b>stress</b> <b>fibres.</b> Different levels of cellular contractility representative of different cell phenotypes are found to alter the range of substrate stiffness that cause the most significant changes in <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> and focal adhesion formation. Furthermore, <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> and focal adhesion formation evolve as a cell spreads on a substrate and leading to the formation of bands of fibres leading from the cell periphery over the nucleus. Inhibiting the formation of FAs during cell spreading is found to limit <b>stress</b> <b>fibre</b> formation.

The arising values of fibre/matrix strain reductions/magnifications decrease/increase with increasing volume fractions of the reinforcing fibre. Significant differences are seen between the transverse, matrix/fibre strain magnification/reduction for the present case where no assumptions are made about the existence of the iso-stress state and others where the assumption applies. The transverse stresses in the composite, matrix and fibre are shown here to be different, which implies that the assumption of transverse iso-stress that is normally made in the study of composite materials is wrong. The fibre stresses are found to be greater in magnitude than the matrix stresses for all volume fractions and up till 71 % reinforcing volume fraction for the hexagonal and square arrays, respectively. The fibre/matrix strain reduction/magnification, fibre and matrix/central sub-region stress ratios are all shown here to be dependent on the fibre geometry for all volume fractions of reinforcing fibre, {{with the exception of the}} fibre/central sub-region stress ratio where this characteristic only prevails below 76 % reinforcing volume fraction...|$|E

Derivations of the analogous equations for viscous sheets include those of Buckmaster, Nachman & Ting (1975), Howell (1996), and Ribe (2002). The essential physical content of shell theory is that a thin sheet can deform either by stretching or by bending, depending on its shape {{and the distribution of}} the external forces acting on it.

The resulting locking-free elements {{were tested in}} a realistic three-dimensional drape simulation of a biaxial fabric as well. The new triangular multi-field element {{seems to be the}} best locking-free element for unaligned meshes. It has a semi-quadratic in-plane and a linear out-of-plane displacement field. This combination improves the accuracy of the element and avoids contact problems in 3 D simulations...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{documented}} in literature that under plane substrate stretching adherent cells reorganize their actin cytoskeleton by reorienting their <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> {{in one or two}} distinct directions, depending upon the magnitude of the substrate strain and the contractile mechanism of the cell. Since the cell is a quite deformable body, previous theoretical modelling according to the principles of linear elasticity theory is not adequate. Experimental evidence such as the concurrent appearance of two distinct and symmetric directions of orientation of the <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> in the same cell indicates the presence of a coexistence of phases nonlinear elastic phenomenon. Moreover, the aforementioned evidence supports the assumption that the strain energy density function of the <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> should be nonconvex. In the present study, following finite elasticity principles, the reorientation phenomenon is treated as a nonlinear elastic stability problem adopting the global (Maxwell's) criterion. In this way, apart from explaining thoroughly the coexistence of phases phenomenon, the contribution of other key elements, such as prestress and substrate strain, is stressed out. Further, the nonconvexity factor is correlated to the influence of the small GTPase Rho, regulator of the formation of the actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres.</b> The predominant final <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> configuration, that is transverse to the maximum extracellular strain direction and appears after the coexistence of phases placement, is also clarified. The mathematical model that is proposed here for the description of adherent cell behaviour under plane substrate stretching is an extension of previous work by the authors, where the orientation of <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> under uniaxial substrate stretching was studied. © 2008 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Mouse Swiss 3 T 3 {{fibroblasts}} {{maintained in}} serum-free medium lose their actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> and focal adhesions. Addition of serum or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to these cells induced the rapid reformation of these structures, {{and the increased}} tyrosine phosphorylation of ppl 25 Fak and paxillin. The formation of focal adhesions and actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> was shown to require tyrosine phosphorylation; it was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and stimulated by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors sodium orthovandate and phenyl arsine oxide. Moreover, the activity of a tyrosine phosphatase directed against ppl 25 Fak and paxillin was elevated in serum-starved cells. Despite the absence of focal adhesions and actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres,</b> the adhesion of serum- starved cells was shown to be mediated by integrins, as peptides corresponding to the cell-binding motif of fibronectin caused cell detachment from the extracellular matrix. In addition, the integrin-mediated formation of actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> and protein tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by introducing C 3 transferase into cells, a result which establishes a role for the small GTP-binding protein rho in signalling via integrins. PKC was also required to maintain adhesion in serum-starved cells as the PKC inhibitor calphostin C caused cell retraction, a process that was accompanied by the formation of actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres.</b> In contrast, activation of PKC with phorbol esters suppressed the LPA-induced assembly of actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres</b> and focal adhesions, and caused loss of these structures in cells grown in serum. The results suggest that PKC negatively regulates the formation of actin <b>stress</b> <b>fibres.</b> The proposed role of vinculin phosphorylation {{in the formation of}} focal adhesions was found to be inconsistent with the finding that the phosphorylated form of the protein is not associated with the Triton X- 100 insoluble fraction in Swiss 3 T 3 cells. Vinculin was a poor substrate for PKC in vitro, although a cryptic C-terminal phosphorylation site was exposed by PIP 2...|$|R
