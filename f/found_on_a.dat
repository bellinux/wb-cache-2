5|$|Ranade {{believes}} that an inscription, found in Alandi and referring to Vitthala and Rakhumai, {{is the oldest}} related to Vithoba, and dates it to 1209. However, the name Pandaranga is <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Rashtrakuta copper plate inscription, dated 516. Citing this, Pande infers that Vithoba's cult was well established by the 6th century.|$|E

5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of}} these are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.|$|E
5|$|Endecott {{used some}} of his {{properties}} to propagate fruit trees; a pear tree he planted still lives in Danvers, Massachusetts. He also engaged {{in one of the}} earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in the colonies when copper ore was found on his land. His name is <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rock in Lake Winnipesaukee, carved by surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony's northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E

5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E
5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E

Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the cast}} in Vampyr were not {{professional}} actors. Jan Hieronimko, who plays the village doctor, was <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> late night metro train in Paris. When approached {{to act in the}} film, Hieronimko stared blankly and did not reply. Hieronimko later contacted Dreyer's crew and agreed to join the film. Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and cafes. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph Maté and art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
5|$|Navajo rubbings {{are found}} in the satchel of a {{motorcyclist}} who crashed while attempting to cross the Canada–United States border. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is called into a meeting with Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) and a few unknown men. She is shown a copy of the rubbings and is asked whether she can identify them. After the meeting, Scully explains to John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) that the rubbings are similar to ones she <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wrecked spacecraft three years prior. Meanwhile, the motorcyclist uses an alien artifact which begins to heal the wounds from his crash.|$|E
