500|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{documentary}} premiered on Channel 4 on December 14, 2005. I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was not released commercially {{and was only}} viewed on MTV and Channel 4. Åkerlund told BlackBook that he wished more people {{had the chance to}} see {{the documentary}} because according to him, it is [...] "a really strong piece of art, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me..... it had a lot of my blood, sweat and tears in it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There isn't {{a team in}} the National League that's {{better than}} us. The pressure's back on them <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me. They were on paper {{the best team in}} the {{division}} last year and they were supposed to win, and they didn’t. One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking in a bad way, like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, he finally said something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E

500|$|Leto {{personally}} {{interviewed the}} band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared {{stories about the}} importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> the right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E

500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|Keef {{is often}} seen as a {{representation}} of the [...] "Chiraq" [...] gangsta rap culture that is present in Chicago. Additionally, Chief Keef {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Sosa" [...] by himself, his peers, and the media. The nickname, [...] "Sosa" [...] is a reference to the drug dealer [...] "Sosa" [...] from Scarface the movie. LA Weekly reported that Keef's Glo Gang entourage respects the rapper. One member of the Glo Gang, Ballout, stated, [...] "We learned all that from Sosa, we be in the studio with him so much," [...] calling him, [...] "a rhyming machine. A music genius. Black Justin Bieber, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me." [...] The New York Times stated that Chief Keef [...] "symbolizes," [...] Chicago's drill music scene, and is the [...] "best known of the young generation of Chicago rappers." [...] In November 2012, Lucy Stehlik of The Guardian, described Keef as drill's, [...] "alpha male." [...] David Drake of Pitchfork Media writes, [...] "Chief Keef is in rarefied air for street rap—a creative voice with an original, cohesive aesthetic," [...] adding, [...] "to the grassroots, among a new generation of stars, he sits at street rap’s aesthetic center, not its margins." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course {{his soul}} felt {{none of these}} emotions. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> this famous man, who by himself was as well worth a journey to England to see, as all the wonders of Rome are worth a journey to Italy, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> him, I say, for the scene of The Little Baker's Boy, he played it; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> him the next minute for the scene from Hamlet, he played that too for you, equally ready to sob over the fall of his pies, and to follow {{the path of the}} dagger in the air."[278] ...|$|R

500|$|Dragon Quest {{has become}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon in Japan. According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii, Dragon Quest has become popular enough that it {{is used as a}} common topic for conversation in Japan, and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan's national game. William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that [...] "the common wisdom is that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> someone from Japan to draw 'Slime,' he'll draw the onion-like shape of the weak enemies from the game." [...] With the Japanese release of Dragon Quest IX in January 2009, a new eatery inspired by the series called Luida's Bar was opened in Roppongi, a well-known nightlife hotspot in Minato, Tokyo. This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo's gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi. The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series: styled in the fashion of a Medieval public house like its virtual counterpart, its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games. It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café Dragon Quest also served as the inspiration for a live-action television drama. Yūsha Yoshihiko initially aired in July 2011, with a sequel series being produced and released the following year. For its 2012 April Fool's Hoax, Google announced a [...] "NES version" [...] of its Google Maps service, which uses graphics and music licensed from Dragon Quest.|$|E
500|$|Garrett {{initially}} wrote [...] "Soldier" [...] {{in a taxi}} while {{going to}} the studio where the band worked on Destiny Fulfilled; he sang the hook to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyoncé stated that as the song had a [...] "Southern feel" [...] and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added [...] "rawness, realness and edge to the song". During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, [...] "That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me why, it was Beyoncé. That shit was big." [...] "Soldier" [...] was included on the group's compilation albums #1's (2005) and [...] (2012).|$|E
500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, is not a bad thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they {{would tell you that}} it is [...] "Not Permitted". <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always feel that they are practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E

Sandra Bullocks is occasionally used to approximate rhyming slang; {{it does not}} quite rhyme, but preserves meter and rhythm. [...] The Beautiful South bowdlerised their original line [...] "sweaty bollocks" [...] as [...] "Sandra Bullocks", as one of several changes to make their song [...] "Don't Marry Her" [...] acceptable for mainstream radio play.|$|E
2500|$|WWE Hall of Famer Bret Hart gave a {{strongly}} negative {{appraisal of the}} show, ranking the Rumble match as [...] "one of the least exciting" [...] in history, and the overall event as perhaps [...] "the worst Royal Rumble".

2500|$|When Newman {{died there}} {{appeared}} in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering sketches by one who had lived under his roof. I ventured to ask Cardinal Manning if he had seen these sketches. He replied that he had and thought them very shocking; the writer must have a very unenviable mind, , and then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a moment's pause he added: [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me if they are like poor Newman, I am bound to say – a photograph." ...|$|E
