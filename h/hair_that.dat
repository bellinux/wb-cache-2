5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E

Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.|$|E

5|$|The Sugababes {{are shown}} {{standing}} {{together in the}} next scene, where they are presented in a dark environment and covered in glitter. Range is represented as the season of autumn, and is decorated with a leaf motif on her face, as well as <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> resembles tree branches. The subsequent clip depicts Berrabah in a winter environment. The group is shown together for a second time, although in a natural environment. The next scenes depict Buchanan in the centre of a large purple flower, and leaves blowing past Range. Towards {{the end of the}} video, the Sugababes are shown in the same dark environment and eventually in their solo settings. Mickey McMonagle from the Sunday Mail praised the group's seasonal outfits in the video.|$|E

5|$|The hindfeet {{are long}} and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the hindfeet are {{surrounded}} by ungual tufts of silvery <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E

5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long <b>hair</b> <b>that</b> obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E

5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calciumâ€“lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimonyâ€“lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These leadâ€“calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing leadâ€“antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in <b>hair)</b> <b>that</b> block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

It is best known for stinging <b>hairs</b> <b>that</b> cover the whole plant and deliver a potent neurotoxin when touched. It is the most toxic of the Australian species of stinging trees.
