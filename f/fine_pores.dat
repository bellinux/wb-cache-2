[...] My question had not been in the least intended for pressure, but it made her turn and look at me, and this, I quickly recognised, was all the answer the most pitiless curiosity could have desired--all the more, as well, that the intention in it had been no greater than in my words. Beautiful, abysmal, involuntary, her exquisite weakness simply opened up the depths it would have closed. It was in short a supremely unsuccessful attempt to say nothing. It said everything, {{and by the end of}} a minute my chatter--none the less out of place for being all audible--was hushed to positive awe by what it had conveyed.

40|$|In {{wastewater}} treatment processes, aeration introduces air into a liquid, providing an aerobic environment for microbial degradation of organic matter. The purpose of aeration is two-fold: 1) {{to supply the}} required oxygen to the metabolizing microorganisms and 2) to provide mixing so that the microorganisms come into intimate contact with the dissolved and suspended organic matter. The two most common aeration systems are subsurface and mechanical. In a subsurface system, air is introduced by diffusers or other devices submerged in the wastewater. A mechanical system agitates the wastewater by various means (e. g., propellers, blades, or brushes) to introduce air from the atmosphere. <b>Fine</b> <b>pore</b> diffusion is a subsurface form of aeration in which air is introduced {{in the form of}} very small bubbles.

30|$|The poultice/substrate system {{describes}} {{an interaction between}} two porous materials in hydraulic contact. Processes like dissolution, diffusion and crystallisation are involved near the interface [8]. The mode of operation depends on environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, wind speed), properties of the materials (composition, porosity and pore-size distribution) and the presence and distribution of liquid and vapor phases inside the substrates [7, 11]. The pore-size distribution is of particular importance for the moisture and ion transport during the drying period, because moisture and ions move by advection from coarser to <b>finer</b> <b>pores.</b> Large pores provide water, while small pores extract salts during drying [7, 11, 15 – 17].|$|R

50|$|The main {{advantage}} over other filtration systems is {{the reduction in}} energy consumption, up to 90% because no air flows through the discs due {{to the use of}} capillary force acting on the pores.

Therefore, the vacuum losses are less, which means the vacuum pump required is smaller than in conventional disc filters, thus minimizing operating costs.

50|$|The {{principle}} of gas diffusion {{is illustrated in}} this diagram. The so-called gas distribution layer {{is located in the}} middle of the electrode. With only a small gas pressure, the electrolyte is displaced from this pore system. A small flow resistance ensures that the gas can freely flow inside the electrode. At a slightly higher gas pressure the electrolyte in the pore system is restricted to the work layer. The surface layer itself has such <b>fine</b> <b>pores</b> that, even when the pressure peaks, gas cannot flow through the electrode into the electrolyte. Such electrodes were produced by scattering and subsequent sintering or hot pressing. To produce multi-layered electrodes a fine-grained material was scattered in a mold and smoothed. Then, the other materials were applied in multiple layers and put under pressure. The production was not only error-prone but also time consuming and difficult to automate.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{fine-grained}} soft clay {{are used as}} the base material. The earth is first mixed with water, then strained. During the process, wood chips are often added, causing the less dense parts to rise while the heavier parts sink to the bottom. This preparation process is repeated for two weeks until the water is entirely filtered without any residues, and the pure, fine clay is obtained {{from the bottom of}} the vat. The reddish to orange color of the clay is important as it will determine the texture and color of the Hagi surface. [...] The beauty of Hagi ware is appreciated not only for its earthy colors but also for the glaze. The translucent beige glaze is to draw out the natural, deep colors of the clay. After being heated in the kiln, the glaze creates its signature fine web of cracks and <b>fine</b> <b>pores</b> -known as an-nyuu (貫入) or crazing- while cooling. Throughout the heating and cooling process, the cracks form because the glaze shrinks faster than the clay. Over time, a Hagi ware user might notice the color of the glaze getting darker. This is natural as the slightly porous surface absorbs the tea residues or sake through its tiny crackles, maturing over time.|$|E
50|$|Soils are {{the product}} of climate, organisms and topography, acting on parent (geologic) {{material}} over time. Thus the great diversity of geologic materials, geomorphic processes, climatic conditions, biotic assemblages and land surface ages in the United States is responsible for the presence of an enormous variety of mineral and organic soils. (Most of the mineral soils contain significant quantities of organic matter, but not enough to qualify for classification as organic soils.) The inorganic particles of different mineral soils vary greatly in size distribution, often as a result of transport and deposition of the parent material from which the soil is formed. Examples include loess (wind-deposited silt), dune sands, alluvial (river-deposited) sands and silts, and glacial till (which may include substantial amounts of clay, silt, sand, gravel and larger particles). Compared with sands (0.05 to 2 mm in diameter), silts (0.002 to 0.05 mm in diameter) have a very much larger specific surface (i.e. particle surface area per unit mass). At the surface of a particle, weathering processes occur. If the particle contains potential plant nutrients in mineral form, such processes result in release of the nutrients in readily available, ionic form. Thus, high specific surface is a major reason why silty soils tend to be relatively fertile. Clay particles are finer than silt, being less than 0.002 mm in diameter. Water retention tends to be greater in the finer-textured soils. If a fine-textured soil is well aggregated (with aggregates consisting of numerous organic and inorganic particles bonded together), the large pores between aggregates will facilitate drainage and aeration. (In contrast, drainage and aeration can be poor in poorly aggregated fine-textured soils in which nearly all of the pore space consists of <b>fine</b> <b>pores.)</b> Drainage is usually good and trafficability is usually superior in the coarser-textured soils. While some of the clay in a soil may have been inherited in the parent material, older soils might contain a significant amount of clay formed by weathering processes during soil formation. Soils with a high concentration of clay and organic matter tend to have considerable net negative electrical charge, conferring ability to retain many plant nutrient cations (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, NH4+), readily available to plants by ion exchange. Plant nutrients are also released from soil organic matter by decomposition, and organic matter is particularly significant as the major form in which soil nitrogen is stored. Organic matter contributes to aggregation and water-retention properties of soil. Soil chemical composition reflects not only the original geologic materials (e.g. limestone, granite, basalt), but also soil-forming processes since deposition. In much of the northern US, soil formation commenced either shortly after glacial retreat {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age, or even more recently. Elsewhere in the US, one may find some older land surfaces where soil formation has occurred over a much longer period, in addition to some young soils.|$|E

40|$|What is aeration? Aeration {{is a step}} in {{wastewater}} treatment where air is added to wastewater for mixing purposes and to enhance biological growth. The purpose of aeration is to dissolve oxygen into wastewater so that the microorganisms can utilize it while they break down organic material. What is fine bubble aeration? Fine bubble aeration is a subsurface form of diffusion in which air is introduced in the form of very small bubbles to aid or enhance the treatment of wastewater. Air flows from a pipe into diffusers located {{at the bottom of a}} tank. These diffusers have numerous small openings (known as pores) through which air flows into the wastewater in the tank. In the past, various diffusion devices have been classified as either fine bubble or coarse bubble based on how efficiently they transferred oxygen to the wastewater. Since it is difficult to clearly distinguish between fine and coarse bubbles, diffused aeration systems have been classified based on the physical characteristics of the equipment. In a fine bubble aeration system, several diffusers are mounted or screwed into a header pipe that may run along the length or width of the tank or on a short manifold mounted on a movable pipe. These diffusers come in various shapes and sizes, such as discs, tubes, domes, and plates. The common types of coarse bubble diffusers are fixed orifices, valved orifices, and static tubes. The bubble size of these diffusers is larger than the porous diffusers, thus, lowering the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). <b>Fine</b> <b>pore</b> diffusers (discs, tubes, domes, and plates) are usually made from ceramic, plastic, or flexible perforated membranes.
