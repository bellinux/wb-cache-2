40|$|Shading fabrics {{have the}} ability to reduce {{daylight}} glare and provide privacy when needed. Recent studies have shown that <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> such as DGP and its simplified version can be used to predict daylight glare through shades when the sun is not within the field of view. However, there are no comprehensive studies on glare sensation with the sun visible through the fabric â€“ a situation that happens in office buildings â€“ and therefore the applicability of <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> for such conditions is uncertain. Shades with very low openness factors transmit only a small amount of direct sunlight due to their weave density; nevertheless, existing glare metrics may show intolerable conditions for these cases, while specific studies with human subjects are nearly non-existent. This paper presents an experimental study on daylight glare evaluation for the case of shading fabrics with the sun within the field of view. 41 human subjects (n= 41) were tested while performing specific office activities, with 14 shade products of different openness factors and visible transmittance values (direct and total light transmission characteristics). The measured variables and survey results were used to: (i) associate discomfort glare with measured and modeled parameters for these cases (ii) evaluate the robustness of existing <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> for these cases (iii) examine recently suggested alternate (direct and total vertical illuminance) criteria for glare assessment through fabrics, extract discomfort thresholds and suggest a new related index and (iv) propose corrections in the DGP equation when the sun is visible through the shades, which could be generalized for other systems following a similar approach. Combining illuminance-based metrics and existing <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> can result in a more realistic glare evaluation covering all cases with and without the sun through shading fabrics. The new results can be inversely used as thresholds for selecting optical properties of shades to ensure glare protection, {{as well as for the}} development of glare-based shading controls. ...|$|R

This study into discomfort glare in open plan green buildings targeted full-time employees, working under their everyday lighting conditions. Three green buildings in Brisbane were used for data collection, two were Green Star accredited and the other contained innovative daylighting strategies. Data were collected on full-time employees, mostly aged between 30 and 50 years, who broadly reflect the demographics of the wider working population in Australia. It was discovered 36 of the 64 respondents experienced discomfort from both electric and daylight sources at their workspace. The study used a specially tailored post-occupancy evaluation (POE) survey to help assess discomfort glare. Luminance maps extracted from High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were used to capture the luminous environment of the occupants. These were analysed using participant data and the program Evalglare. The physical results indicated no correlation with other developed glare metrics for daylight within these open plan green buildings, including the recently developed Daylight <b>Glare</b> Probability (DGP) <b>Index.</b> The strong influence of vertical illuminance, Ev in the DGP precludes the mostly contrast-based glare from windows observed in this investigation from forming a significant part of this index.

40|$|Daylight, in {{interior}} lighting design, {{is more and}} more frequent, not just for physiological and psychological causes, but also for energy saving that could be obtained through a suitable daylighting and an optimal integration between daylight and electrical light. Also the new European standard EN 15193 (2007), “Energy performance of buildings – energy requirements”, about energy saving in buildings, considers the lighting system as a relevant element for building energy performance evaluation. The advantages related to daylight presence into the working areas make this illumination system the favourite one by designers and engineers. However, glare is often inter-related to daylighting and is generated by: - High level of lighting from direct solar radiation or from sky vault (when any part of it is in the observer field of view); - Secondary reflection of light from internal and external surfaces, characterized by high reflection factor. In this paper, after a brief description concerning glare phenomena, it is made evidence of the uncertainty and complexity of DGI applications.

40|$|AbstractA {{previous}} {{series of}} experiments conducted by the authors under a controlled laboratory setting detected substantive evidence of an effect of time of day, {{and the influence of}} various temporal variables, on reported glare sensation from artificial lighting. To substantiate and generalise the postulated temporal effects on glare response, a semi-controlled study was set up in a test room with direct access to daylight and to an external view. Forty participants gave glare sensation votes at three times of day, randomised over different days, while engaging with visual tasks under two shading conditions. Self-assessments of several temporal variables – fatigue, hunger, caffeine intake, mood, prior light exposure, sky condition – were provided by test subjects with their glare assessments. A multilevel statistical analysis of the data – considering factors that were experimentally manipulated (fixed effects) and variables that changed over time (random effects) – confirmed a statistically significant and practically relevant effect of time of day on subjective evaluations of glare sensation. The influences detected showed a tendency towards an increasing tolerance to discomfort from daylight glare as the day progresses. In addition, the variances associated with temporal variables were found to partially confound the effect of time of day on glare response. The results from this study substantiate previous laboratory findings and support the conclusion that the conventional physical and photometric parameters utilised in <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> and formulae might not be sufficient to consistently describe and predict the occurrence and magnitude of discomfort glare from natural and artificial lighting...|$|R

40|$|Discomfort glare is {{considered}} to be an annoyance or distraction caused by sources of non-uniform or high luminance within the field of view of an observer. There are still significant gaps in our understanding of the conditions that characterise the magnitude and occurrence of discomfort glare, this being especially evident in the presence of large sources of luminance such as windows. The large degree of scatter that is observed when subjective evaluations of glare sensation are compared against calculated <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> suggests that discomfort glare may be dependent on other variables beyond the physical and photometric parameters that are commonly embedded in glare formulae (e. g., source luminance, source size, background luminance, and position index). There are strong reasons to believe that some of these variables might be linked to the time of day when the observer is exposed to the glare source. In response, this thesis investigated the research hypothesis that subjective glare sensation is associated with temporal variability. This hypothesis was tested in two stages. The first stage was conducted within a laboratory setting, and sought to examine temporal effects under controlled artificial lighting conditions. The collection of temporal variables and personal factors – thereby examining the scatter in glare responses across the independent variable (time of day) and isolating potential confounding variables – enabled to identify factors that could influence the subjective evaluation of glare sensation along the day. Having established the presence of a temporal effect on glare response, the influences detected were further explored within a test room with direct access to daylight, whereby temporal variables and personal factors were measured in conjunction to glare sensation for them to be statistically masked from the analysis. The results confirmed the hypothesis of an increased tolerance to glare as the day progresses. This supported the conclusion that physical and photometric parameters alone are not sufficient for a robust prediction of discomfort glare...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{about global}} warming are increasing, hence, the urgency to cut carbon emissions. Reducing energy consumption, {{including}} lighting energy, {{is seen as the}} primary solution. Yet, solving the environmental factor should not come at the cost of other pillars of sustainable development. Rather, maximizing the total value of the building should be the focus. Maximizing value in the context of lighting entails improving the quality of the lighting. This study has investigated how lighting simulation could help in achieving better lighting quality. The aim of the thesis was defined as to understand the underlying architecture of lighting simulation and obtain an overview of its characteristics and applications as well as to study the use of current simulation tools. The theoretical background of lighting simulation (in the domain of Systems Engineering) was reviewed from the literature. This revealed the missing and imperfect links in the solution-to-value chain. The thesis suggests the use of a new base metric, Retinal Illuminance Map, as a solution, which in combination with black box simulation of a visual system can help repair this incomplete chain. The study of the current lighting simulation tools (Paper 1) revealed that illuminance-based metrics, luminance-based metrics, daylight availability metrics, and <b>glare</b> <b>indexes</b> are the most available performance metrics in existing lighting simulation tools. Based on usability, acceptability, availability, and previous references in the literature six software programs (Radiance, DAYSIM, Evalglare, DIALux, VELUX, and VISSLA) were selected and compared. It was found that no single tool could meet all the needs of a designer, hence, simulation tool(s) should be selected (or combined) according to the requirements of project goals and the stage of design. Building on these studies, applications of lighting simulation were identified and compiled in relation to different aspects, including performance metrics, stages of design, optimization, model integration, BIM, and parametric modeling. To obtain first-hand information about lighting designers’ experience, an online survey was conducted in Sweden (Paper 2). The results showed that lighting simulation programs were widely (90 %) used in Sweden for analysis and/or rendering purposes. The majority of lighting designers considered both daylight and artificial light in their design. Factors such as ease-of use, simulation time and training had more weight than accuracy and the diversity of metrics in practitioner’s eyes.

40|$|With {{perimeter}} office spaces {{with large}} glazing facades being an indisputable trend in modern architecture, human comfort {{has been in}} the scope of Building science; the necessity to improve occupants’ satisfaction, along with maintaining sustainability has become apparent, as productivity and even the well-being of occupants are connected with maintaining a pleasant environment in the interior. While thermal comfort has been extensively studied, the satisfaction with the visual environment has still aspects that are either inadequately explained, or even entirely absent from literature. This Thesis investigated most aspects of the visual environment, including visual comfort, lighting energy performance through the utilization of daylight and connection to the outdoors, using experimental studies, simulation studies and human subjects’ based experiments. ^ Visual discomfort is mostly associated with discomfort glare, which can be evaluated using a variety of available different indices with known strengths and weaknesses. Most of the latter are based on the luminance distribution of the visual field. Obtaining the luminance distribution is a complex procedure, either on an experimental or simulation level; experimental acquisition involves the use of dSLR cameras and HDR imaging, along with a series of image processing, calibrations and calculations, while it faces challenges in cases of measuring the solar corona, due to its extreme peak luminance level. This leads to time consuming procedures with questionable accuracy. Also, when it comes to simulations, a detailed luminance mapping of the interior involves time consuming renderings, which makes annual simulations slow and inefficient. This Thesis uses three different experimental methodologies for luminance acquisition in order to provide accurate and fast measurements, even for the case of the sun being included in the field of view, and also utilizes a hybrid ray-tracing and radiosity lighting model to improve the effectiveness of annual discomfort modeling with the minimal compromise in terms of accuracy. The experimental methodology has been evaluated in preliminary human subjects testing in real office spaces in order to validate its effectiveness and also give some preliminary results and directions for the next parts. ^ Daylight Glare Probability is the most recent visual discomfort index, and currently considered to be the most reliable, as it is extracted by human subjects experimentation. However, the specific conditions under which it was proposed and its behavior in specific cases have raised some concerns in terms of its effectiveness in different conditions, {{especially when it comes to}} roller shades and the sun being included in the field of view. This Thesis used experimental and simulation analysis to evaluate the behavior of Daylight Glare Probability under different shading controls, investigate the effectiveness of the simplified index DGPs and pointed out inconsistencies in special cases, like facing the sun through roller shades. ^ To address the inconsistencies identified, an extended human subjects study was performed, in order to evaluate visual discomfort in the special case of the sun being visible through shading fabrics. Discomfort thresholds are extracted for important interior illuminance and luminance metrics, and a variety of widely used <b>glare</b> <b>indices</b> are evaluated in terms of their prediction performance. Two new discomfort metrics are proposed, DGPmod and GlareEV, to be used in a dual function form only for the cases of the sun being visible through shading fabrics. ^ As the quality of view is highly subjective and connected to a lot of non-quantifiable parameters, its only measurable aspect, the visual clarity has been investigated. By developing a scoring system based on a combination of subjective and objective questions, human subjects’ surveys have been used to find that visual clarity is a function of the fabrics’ most common properties, the openness factor and visible transmittance. Through the use of the developed equation, the View Clarity Index (VCI), architects can have an understanding about the visual clarity in the design phase. ^ Finally, in the lack of a unified design methodology based on the visual environment, the newly obtained knowledge of this Thesis has been combined to propose the Visual Environment Index, a design framework based on three main visual environment factors: visual comfort, lighting energy performance and connection to the outdoors. In that scope, a suite of three metrics are introduced, the Visual Comfort Autonomy (VCA), to account for the portion of annual working hours under conditions of comfort, the Continuous Daylight Autonomy to cover the lighting energy savings, and the Effective Outside View (EOV), to quantify the connection to the outdoors. Using these three metrics in the framework of VEI can help architects make decisions in terms of façade configurations, shading controls or even positional layouts in private or open plan offices. ...|$|R
40|$|Lighting is an {{important}} environmental factor when considering health and safety, visual comfort and workplace design. But how well do we really understand the implications of lighting on these factors, especially in a workplace environment? When one attempts to digest the enormous volume of information {{of the past century}} regarding recommended lighting conditions, one begins to see that these recommendations are varied, not extensively tested and often apply to a very limited set of luminous conditions. In a world with daylighting design which increasingly challenges creative and technological boundaries, {{it is important that the}} factors and limits which contribute to visual comfort are well understood in order to test these new designs. Daylighting design also becomes important simply from a sustainability standpoint with energy efficiency becoming increasingly important in this age of diminishing natural resources. With an increase in the amount of daylight in buildings spawning from this desire to capitalize on the free and daily renewable light from the sun, difficult and often immeasurable factors such as a view of the outdoors and higher adaptation levels of space users' eyes could very realistically affect the current limits of the human visual system for visual comfort. Visual comfort, limits, which at best are ball park figures, loosely understood and rarely adhered to. This paper documents the testing of 48 test subjects, all of an age where they could feasibly be expected to work in an office environment, in a simulated contemporary office environment with a simulated daylighting window where the luminous conditions and layout were altered to assess the impact of such changes on visual comfort, productivity and different types of user characteristics. The window is designed so luminances of the window can be changed at will. By comparing subjective assessments of the lighting conditions with test performances, a greater understanding of the luminance limits (maximums and ratios) of the human eye for different contemporary lighting layouts within working-aged populations can be defined. With improved understanding of human tolerances to luminance distributions and lighting conditions which romote visual comfort and productivity, designers can begin to give glare prediction with respect to likely effects on these factors. This information would be highly valuable to office based firms who are currently building new or retrofitting premises (to the point where they would likely pay for it as an investment for future efficiency of their firms) thereby proving beneficial to demand for skilled architects, interior and lighting designers. In comparison to the relatively more complicated <b>glare</b> prediction <b>indices</b> involving various factors and calculations, luminance ratio recommendations are an easy to understand tool which with further study could become a powerful method of site and even user-specific glare prediction in the future...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze {{discomfort}} glare sensation in subjects aged 50 years and more in comparison with younger subjects (i. e. younger than 35 years of age). Material and Methods: The experiments were performed on a computer workstation placed in controlled lighting environment where 2 discomfort glare conditions were modeled. Each participant performed for about 1 h specially designed visual tasks, including the tests with Landolt's rings presented on the screen by a computer program. The glare evaluation method consisted of subjective evaluation of discomfort glare on the semantic glare rating scale, tests of mesopic contrast and glare sensitivity, subjective assessment of lighting quality and asthenopic symptoms. The time needed to perform the task and the number of mistakes were also recorded. The subjective evaluation of glare was compared with the Unified <b>Glare</b> Rating (UGR) <b>index</b> calculated by the DIALux simulation program. Results: A higher percentage of the younger group subjects assessed glare after the experimental session as uncomfortable and intolerable than in the 50 + group, who more often assessed glare as acceptable. The assessment of discomfort glare in the younger group corresponded to higher UGR value compared to UGR value calculated by DIALux. In the 50 + group, such correlation was found only for lower discomfort glare (UGR = 19). The results showed that younger participants more frequently suffered from visual fatigue and assessed lighting as less comfortable. However, the mesopic glare sensitivity increased significantly after the experiments only in the 50 + group under both glare conditions. Conclusions: The obtained results showed that discomfort glare sensation changes with age. The younger population seems to be more sensitive and demanding than the older one in relation to discomfort glare limiting, in spite of the lack of significant objective measures of fatigue. The exposure of the elderly to bigger discomfort glare could adversely affect the objective measures of fatigue like mesopic glare sensitivity and visual performance...|$|R
