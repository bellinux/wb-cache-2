500|$|Dorival Caymmi {{died at age}} 94 {{of kidney}} cancer and {{multiple}} organ failure on August 16, 2008, {{at his home in}} Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. His granddaughter, Stella, who wrote a biography about him in 2001, said, [...] "He did not know that he had cancer, and {{he did not want to}} <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not ask much about this. He was first hospitalized in 1999. My grandfather went through with treatment, but he did not want to know anything about the illness. He acted with serenity every day, and because of that, we respected this wish." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{witness who}} testified {{on behalf of}} then-Judge Thomas was Nancy Fitch, a special {{assistant}} historian to Thomas at EEOC, who said [...] "here is no way" [...] Thomas did what Hill alleged. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> no such thing," [...] she declared under oath. Also Diane Holt, Thomas' personal secretary for six years, said that, [...] "At no time did Professor Hill intimate, {{not even in the}} most subtle of ways, that Judge Thomas was asking her out or subjecting her to the crude, abusive conversations that have been described. Nor did I ever discern any discomfort, when Professor Hill was in Judge Thomas' presence." [...] Additionally, Phyllis Berry-Myers, another special assistant to Thomas, said that he [...] "was respectful, demand of excellence in our work, cordial, professional, interested in our lives and our career ambitions". Berry-Myers said that her [...] "impression" [...] was that Professor Hill desired a greater relationship with Judge Thomas than [...] "just a professional one".|$|E

6000|$|Nanda {{looked at}} him with her long grave straight-ness, which had often a play of light beyond any smile. [...] "Oh, you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> want more." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY. He did: you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> You {{told me to}} {{tell the}} exact truth.|$|E
6000|$|Reddy {{hung his}} head. [...] "I don't care!" [...] he said, which was very, very foolish, because, you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> care {{a very great}} deal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How many? There were five, but I {{think that}} fellow down there sold one; but then I think he bought another. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> something.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes; you {{are always}} good to me; and as to my uncle, I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean to be unkind. I should not fear that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My father! you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not like}} me, my {{presence}} {{is always a}} source of irritation to him, he cannot even bear {{me to look at}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> {{never going}} on no cruise-- [...] <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> and {{finished}} with the sea, [...] And yet he likes to feel she's there to use-- [...] If he should ask her--as she used to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{ought to}} be," [...] said Mrs. Burton. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> admire your drawings, Nelie; even those you {{had at the}} fair, that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't mean {{anything}} of that kind, Emily. You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, and you should not say so. It would be too horrible to think of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} made me so happy!" [...] she said tremulously. [...] "Oh, you can never know how happy! Nothing hurts now--nothing ever can hurt, because I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> care." ...|$|E
60|$|If it {{concerns}} Tom, don't tell me, please. You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> do ridiculous things at times. But I don't let him worry me any more; so don't worry me about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course Lew likes me. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> and I {{want him}} to," [...] said Betty. [...] "But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care as {{you seem to}} think. Grandmother Watkins said the same. I am sure {{both of you are}} wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] said Wamba, [...] "fool as I am, I {{shall not}} do your fool's errand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou <b>knowest</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not always miss his mark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{but that}} is over now. I am to go and live at Scarrowby at once, and have the shooting. He can't want me to remain there all by myself." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> That evening--a week ago, {{when he was}} squiring me {{home from}} the concert. It was raining, and my face was wet; he said {{that was why he}} did it.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{he emerged}} from legal infancy," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Skimpole, [...] "he parted from our conversational friend Kenge and took up, I believe, with Vholes. Indeed, I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> because I introduced him to Vholes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{exactly the}} same materials," [...] said Will, {{thinking}} {{that he would be}} duly reserved. [...] "He is not an Orientalist, you <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not profess to have more than second-hand knowledge there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The pore boy tries; I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> Jacob; and <b>he</b> {{wants to}} please you. But he {{give up a}} good deal when he give up bein' a preacher; I s'pose we ought to {{remember}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Monsieur, the {{law could}} not prove it against him to its satisfaction. So the law says. Nevertheless, {{all the world}} <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it. The people knew it so well, that they tried to tear him to pieces.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{more than}} suspicion. Hear me calmly. I speak for your good. I know this man's {{influence}} was fatal to your father. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> all {{in his power to}} widen the breach with your grandfather.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> Mr. Arabin. He {{asked you}} {{whether he would}} be doing right to receive me at Plumstead if I {{continued}} my acquaintance with a gentleman {{who happens to be}} personally disagreeable to yourself and to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be {{one with}} you," [...] the girl smiled. [...] "Poor Nash isn't worth talking about. What was it {{but a small}} {{question}} of action when he preached to you, as I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{to give up your}} seat?" ...|$|E
50|$|In 2000 {{he married}} Natasha, a Russian dentist he {{met at a}} health farm. The {{marriage}} ended after five years. Although he titled his autobiography Things the Grandchildren Should <b>Know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not have any children of his own.|$|R
60|$|Charnock did not answer, {{but gave}} her a curious look, and she pondered {{for a moment or}} two. He was {{obviously}} moved, but one could not tell how far his emotions went, and she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to listen. She understood her husband and <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> sometimes deceived himself.|$|R
5000|$|Millicent [...] "Millie" [...] Chapin: Millie is {{the wife}} of Drew Dexter. She marries him {{despite the fact that}} she <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not love her and will cause her great pains. After their marriage, she {{gradually}} becomes an alcoholic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps he was {{not sorry}} {{to be rid of}} him, and to have in his {{possession}} a large sum of money, four thousand ducats, with which he could tempt fortune once more; as you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> at your table that night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{heard me}} ask Pa to buy her. He heard Clarence {{say that he}} would bid her in for me. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> And yet he goes in and outbids Clarence, and buys her himself. Do you think any gentleman would do that, Puss Russell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're presuming a good deal," [...] was the answer; and Lane's {{face grew}} malevolent as {{he glanced at}} Steel and me. [...] "How do you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> destroy himself, anyway; and if he did, I guess it's an open secret he had trouble with Ormesby and Steel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No: {{it is not}} so much that. But--it {{sounds very}} silly--if I attempt to play or sing in his presence, I become so frightfully nervous that I hardly know what I am <b>doing.</b> I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not like my singing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He is {{not willing}} to receive {{commendation}} that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not deserve," [...] thought Wallace to himself. [...] "That is a good sign. That is a great deal better trait of character than to be able to lay up money." ...|$|R
