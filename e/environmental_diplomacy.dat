40|$|After {{the cold}} war, {{environmental}} conflicts {{have become a}} predominant issue for analysis {{as a function of}} state security, negotiation, conflict resolution and preventive diplomacy. Conflicts over water are {{perhaps one of the most}} dominant issues in the environment-security dialectic. Specifically, water conflicts in the Middle East are of very serious concern given the aridity of the region, population growth, its relative low development, and the historical protracted conflict that has plagued the region. While the paper discusses issues relevant for global water conflicts, it focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian water conflict (given its centrality to the regional conflict). It considers the historical claims, international legal claims and negotiating positions of the parties. It also makes references to the water negotiations that took place during the 2000 Camp David talks. The paper then shows how <b>environmental</b> preventive <b>diplomacy</b> may be applied to the water conflict in the Middle East by referring to several related guidelines including theories of international relations, conflict resolution and international law and demonstrates their relevance to preventive diplomacy and the Israeli-Palestinian water conflict. preventive diplomacy; Israeli-Palestinian water conflict; security; international relations theory; conflict resolution theory; international water law; up-stream and down-stream positions; joint management institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|About the book: Over {{the past}} thirty years nongovernmental {{organizations}} (NGOs) have played an increasingly influential role in international negotiations, particularly on <b>environmental</b> issues. NGO <b>diplomacy</b> has become, {{in the words of one}} organizer, "an international experiment in democratizing intergovernmental decision making. " But there has been little attempt to determine the conditions under which NGOs make a difference in either the process or the outcome of international negotiations. This book presents an analytic framework for the systematic and comparative study of NGO <b>diplomacy</b> in international <b>environmental</b> negotiations. Chapters by experts on international environmental policy apply this framework to assess the effect of NGO diplomacy on specific negotiations on environmental and sustainability issues. The proposed analytical framework offers researchers the tools with which to assess whether and how NGO diplomats affect negotiation processes, outcomes, or both, and through comparative analysis the book identifies factors that explain variation in NGO influence, including coordination of strategy, degree of access, institutional overlap, and alliances with key states. The empirical chapters use the framework to evaluate the degree of NGO influence on such negotiations as the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol negotiations on global climate change, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. ...|$|R

50|$|Susskind {{has tried}} to apply {{consensus}} building techniques to global environmental treaty-making. Since nations are sovereign, all multilateral agreements must be reached {{through a process of}} diplomatic negotiation. In <b>Environmental</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> (1993) Susskind explores the ways in which global treaty-making can be improved through the formal involvement of non-governmental interests, a better balance between science and politics, the use of contingent agreements, and the involvement of professional mediators. For twenty years, Susskind and his colleague, William Moomaw of The Fletcher School, have published Papers on International Environmental Treaty-making (Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School) providing detailed evidence to support these assertions. In Transboundary Environmental Negotiation (with William Moomaw and Paul Gallagher) (2001), they offer detailed case studies of consensus building in global environmental treaty-making.|$|E

40|$|International Environmental Law is a {{framework}} of obligations, measurable norms, and consultative procedures associated with elaborating these norms and facilitating their implementation. It is through the practice of multilateral <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> that Nations primarily establish international environmental law. These multilateral negotiations {{take place in the}} General Assembly or the Economic 2 ̆ 6 Social Council of the United Nations or in other treaty organizations, such as the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity or the World Conservation Congress of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Such environmental diplomatic negotiations are on-going and reiterative, and shape specific international law instruments, such as policy documents (“soft law” such as Resolutions or Declarations) and new international agreements (“hard law” such as treaties or protocols), or decisions made by treaty organizations (such as decisions of a competent international body, binding on the organizations and its members states). Although it is difficult for students to find employment in <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> related positions immediately after graduation it does occur, and others work their way into such positions. Because few international governmental and non-governmental organizations, or multi-national companies, hire directly out of law school it is especially important for students to demonstrate practical experience in the field. This is difficult to do, since for the most part law schools offer doctrinal courses which provide a base of knowledge, but no practical experience. For this reason Pace Law School developed among its experiential learning courses an experiential learning opportunity for law students to study <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and to participate in the process of intergovernmental, multilateral environmental decision-making, and to consciously reflect upon and evaluate those experiences in a United Nations <b>Environmental</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> Practicum. The Practicum comprises a seminar taught by Pace faculty with extensive UN experience, and placement with a country diplomatic Mission at the UN. For the most part these are Missions of Small Island Developing States, or other Less Developed Countries, which benefit greatly from the work of the law student interns. Students learn first-hand how <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> shapes the laws which they study in their public international law or international environmental law courses, and they garner unique knowledge from being inside the UN, which is useful in employment with the many international nongovernmental environmental organizations that work at and with the UN, or for law practices that must understand how decision-making functions within the multilateral environmental agreements that affect their clients. The UN Diplomacy course is often a transformative experience for students, providing experiential learning at a deeper level than most such courses. This presentation will examine both the doctrinal and experiential aspects of teaching such an experiential course. While the unusual issues raised by the unique forum will be considered, the transferability of pedagogical strategies to other teaching situations will be explored...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Environmental {{degradation}} and conflict are global dilemmas threatening lives and livelihoods. Despite the imminent dangers they pose to planet Earth, diverse political interests have made effective environmental policymaking and its implementation the most daunting task at all levels—from local, through state to global. In Sub-Saharan Africa, natural resources {{play a major}} role in defining the power relations involved in the violent struggles for political leadership. The issues of resource {{degradation and}} conflict in the Mau Forest are of central importance for East African communities because of their national, regional, and global implications. Drawing on the case of the Mau forest, this study examines the political complexities in Kenya and the nexus between governance, environmental degradation, and conflict. The study seeks to understand how political dimensions and consequences have failed the environment and natural resources in Kenya, in particular the Mau Forest. While the origins of environmental degradation and conflict can be traced back to colonialism, the subsequent undemocratic political leadership and politics of patronage in Kenya have compounded these problems by undermining the institutions of environmental governance and the existing legal and policy instruments. However, resource degradation and conflict in the Mau Forest have transboundary repercussions. Solutions to the environmental challenges facing the Mau Forest necessarily involve solutions developed through regimes of <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> In this thesis, <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is specifically understood as a governance mechanism, and therefore a key instrument of global environmental governance. Past approaches to <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> exhibit a distinctive realist bias that is dominated by a state-centred preoccupation with rapid economic growth. An alternative to state-centred approaches is needed, one that actively promotes democratic and ecological values as cornerstones of regimes of environmental governance. The potential for an ecological democracy approach to governance and how this might enhance environmental governance capacity in Kenya and beyond, frames the analysis developed in this study. It is argued that the principles and practices of ecological democracy have the potential to improve currently existing environmental governance measures. In this context, the study thus examines Kenya’s role in regional and global multilateral <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in relation to Mau Forest. This thesis therefore pursues the argument that the establishment of institutions for collective action such as the Lake Victoria Basin Commission makes it possible to develop collaborative efforts to regulate resource use of the Mau Forest and its related water basins. These efforts point the way towards workable and practical solutions to transboundary resource challenges. The unique contribution of this study is to show that an ecological democracy perspective has the potential to improve current measures of <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> In this way, an ecological democratic approach has the capacity to strengthen transboundary regimes of environmental governance. In turn, this will help reduce the twin problems of resource degradation and conflict...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{achievements}} of Middle East <b>environmental</b> <b>diplomacy</b> under the multilateral track and lays out a feasible program to build on these achievements. It argues that negotiations should be informed by three lessons {{from the history of}} international water diplomacy. These are: 1) unequal partners may unequally share {{the costs and benefits of}} cooperation; 2) third-party mediation is most successful if accompanied by “carrot and stick” policies; and 3) cooperation should proceed as a series of modest steps, rather than as a grand regional plan. The paper analyzes three issues in urgent need of multicountry cooperation. These are: 1) food for water trades to enhance food and water security in the region; 2) a transition to integrated pest management to halt the pollution of groundwater from agricultural runoff; and 3) the treatment and reuse of urban wastewater for health and water conservation. In addition, the countries of the region should, jointly and individually, invest in environmental training and outreach.
