Customers and new environmental regulations demand both higher specific power and more environmentally friendly trucks, and this places a rising pressure on the manufactures. This demand could be met by increasing the peak pressure in the cylinders. Consequently, a more efficient combustion is obtained and the exhaust lowered. This however exposes the engine to higher loads and material physical properties must therefore be enhanced. Today, alloyed gray iron is the predominantly used engine material. This material cannot {{meet the requirements of}} tomorrow’s engines. Compacted Graphite Iron has good potential to be the replacement; it opens new design opportunities with its superior strength, which can lead to smaller, more efficient engines and additional power. The question is: how will manufacturing be affected?
