5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Morley derided the {{seriousness}} of contemporary music writers: [...] "Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists - or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks - actually write {{with a kind of}} fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been." [...] That same year, Rosen forewarned possible excesses of the new movement; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored. A week later, PopMatters Rob Horning responded to Rosen's embracing of poptimism and wrote that it is [...] "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction." [...] Writing for The Quietus in 2017, Michael Hann argued that [...] "the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists", and lists the following as a few poptimist [...] "sacred cows, which are beyond challenge": ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{graduation}} from school, Philipp had {{to complete his}} compulsory six months in the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD—Reich Labor Service). He began his RAD service on 2 January 1936 in Lager 5/150 (Camp 5/150) in Riesa. He was released early and started his military training as a Fahnenjunker (cadet) on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School (Luftkriegsschule 2) at Gatow, on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. Among his classmates were Werner Baumbach, who became a bomber pilot, and Helmut Lent, a nightfighter pilot. Philipp, {{as a member of}} the 4. Schülerkompanie (4th Student Company), completed Lehrgang I (1st course) by 4 August 1936, Lehrgang II (2nd course) by 31 May 1937, and the final Lehrgang III (3rd course) by 31 August 1937. He received the Pilot's Badge after completing these courses. During this training period he was promoted to Fahnenjunker-Gefreiter (cadet-private) on 1 October 1936, Fahnenjunker-Unteroffizier (cadet-corporal) on 1 December 1936, Fähnrich (ensign) on 1 April 1937 and Oberfähnrich (senior ensign) on 1 December 1937. Philipp was promoted to the officer rank of Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 24 February 1938, with the effective date was backdated to 1 January 1938. His commanding officer released him with the words, [...] "I release you with great concern <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> career, but with even greater concern for the Air Force as a whole"—apparently Philipp had been aware that his promotion was at risk for his opposition to the monotony of the training system. Just prior to his promotion he had started looking for an alternative employment with the Maschinenfabrik Pekrun (machine factory Pekrun) in Coswig, which his dance partner, Margarete Strunz, had helped to arrange.|$|E

500|$|Two main {{charges were}} brought to the House of Commons against Marlborough: first, an {{assertion}} that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that he had taken 2.5% from the pay of the foreign troops in English pay, amounting to £280,000. Despite Marlborough's refutations (claiming ancient precedent for the first allegation, and, for the second, producing a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deductions in lieu of secret-service money for the war), the findings were enough for Harley to persuade the Queen to release her Captain-General. On 29 December 1711 (O.S.), before the charges had been examined, Anne, who owed to him the success and glory of her reign, sent her letter of dismissal: [...] "I am sorry <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> sake the reasons are become so public which makes it necessary for me to let you know you have render'd it impracticable for you to continue yet longer in my service". The Tory dominated Parliament concluded by a substantial majority that, [...] "the taking of several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough from the contractor for foraging the bread and wagons... was unwarrantable and illegal", and that the 2.5% deducted from the pay of foreign troops [...] "is public money and ought to be accounted for". When his successor, the Duke of Ormonde, left London for The Hague to take command of British forces he went, noted Bishop Burnet, with [...] "the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of Marlborough".|$|E
