40|$|Numerous organisms produce ornately {{detailed}} inorganic structures (often {{known as}} shells) with features on length scales from the nanoscale to the microscale. One organism, {{commonly referred to}} as a diatom, originates from algae and is found throughout the oceans on Earth. These diatoms possess skeletal structures, frustules, made from silicon dioxide. This chemical makeup limits the number of possible applications for which these structures can be used. Using a series of gas displacement reactions, these frustules can be converted to other useful materials, such as magnesium oxide and titanium dioxide, while maintaining the features of the frustule template. In the current research, silicon dioxide frustules were converted to titanium dioxide replicas using method previously devised by our group. The titanium dioxide replicas were subjected to a hydrothermal reaction by exposing the replicas to an aqueous basic solution containing barium hydroxide to form barium titanate and barium strontium titanate replicas.

One of the paired TLD crystals was then mailed to Baton Rouge and its entangled counterpart remained in Givarlais. The crystal in Baton Rouge (master) was then subjected to thermal stimulation which elicited a measurable light emission response in the counterpart (slave) under a photomultiplier in Givarlais.

40|$|Large sheet {{thermoforming}} {{is widely}} used for the manufacture of parts such as twin sheet formed gas tanks, body panels and windshields. These complex technical parts require a precise temperature map to be realized prior to forming. In particular, the material used for forming gas tanks incorporates an EVOH barrier layer that is susceptible to tearing when exact processing conditions are not strictly respected. The problem {{is compounded by the}} fact that the temperature is presently controlled at the heating elements, while the temperature distribution across the thickness of the sheet is the main process variable. This makes the thermoforming process very susceptible to perturbations and greatly increases the number of rejected parts. In order to increase productivity and quality, the actual sheet temperature distribution before forming must adhere to the optimized temperature map as predicted by a process simulation or the recipe as determined by previous runs. The system presented here controls the amount of energy received by every sheet zone, which is equivalent to controlling the sheet temperature.

40|$|We {{examined}} the susceptibility of δ 15 N-signals and C org /N ratios in organic-rich sediments to pre-analysis sample treatment. Each sample {{was subjected to}} three different kinds of processing. For comparative purposes, the first measurement series (MS- 1) was carried out on untreated sediment. In MS- 2, the sediment was rinsed with distilled water. In MS- 3, analyses were carried out on decalcified and rinsed material, in MS- 4 the samples were decalcified without being subsequently washed. The sediment yielded conspicuously different results {{depending on the type}} of processing it was subjected to. Rinsing, irrespective of whether acidification was included or not, induced substantial modifications in δ 15 N accompanied by a pronounced loss of NH 4 + (up to 14 wt% of the initial N-content). Molar C org /N ratios, on the other hand, were only affected by a combination of acidification and rinsing. The discrepancies are ascribed to the influence of decomposition-derived ammonium (NH 4 +). In untreated sediment (MS- 1), NH 4 + seems to produce misleading shifts in both δ 15 N-signals and C org /N ratios. Presumed mechanisms involved are as follows: Firstly, nitrogen isotopes fractionate during NH 4 + -volatilisation in the <b>heating</b> <b>oven,</b> where the sediment is put to desiccate. Secondly, NH 4 + -ions are able to escape that fractionation when adsorbed to negatively-charged SiO 2 -surfaces. The adsorption capacity of SiO 2 increases with increasing pH of the pore water and hence with increasing carbonate content. Our findings raise serious doubts about whether untreated sediment (MS- 1) can provide reliable C org /N and δ 15 N-records. Pre-analysis acidification plus rinsing (MS- 3) seems to eliminate the deceptive influence of NH 4 + -adsorption and -outgassing. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 201100004 </a...|$|E

This study deals with the numerical simulation of the heating step of the process. The numerical model has been validated using three woven glass and carbon / PA 6. 6 composites provided by Solvay Rhodia. This type of simulation consists in solving the heat equation with a radiative flux that characterizes {{the interaction of the}} material with the IR heating. The model thus considers the IR properties of the material (emission and reflexion). Considering a homogeneous composite, the optical and thermal properties of sheets have been first measured. The material’s emissivity has been measured using a FTIR spectrometer from the reflective and transmitive spectra, by using the Kirchoff law and considering a Lambertian material. Three complementary measurement techniques were used to determine the thermal properties of the composites. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements have been performed to identify the heat capacity of the composites. On another hand, a hot disc system (measurements performed at the LTN, France) has been used in transient conditions to determine the heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of the composites is all three directions. Finally, the in-plane thermal matrix of conductivity has also been measured by thermography by using an inverse method. The simulation of composites heating has been performed with Comsol MultiphysicsTM and the simulation procedure was validated by comparison with experimental results. The simulated IR oven is composed of 9 IR emittors provided by Toshiba Lighting Company that emit mainly in short IR wavelength (0. 75 - 2 µm).

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} offer {{high energy}} and power densities {{as well as}} long life time but have a more narrow stability window compared to other battery types and contain reactive and flammable materials. In case of overheating the battery cell can release gas (vent) and, at temperatures of about 150 - 200 °C, a so called thermal runaway can occur, that is a rapid self-heated temperature increase which is typically accompanied with a large release of smoke and gas, fire and a potential cell case explosion or gas explosion. In this work Li-ion battery safety has been studied by abuse tests; external fire, external <b>heating</b> (<b>oven),</b> external short circuit and overcharge. In total fifteen types of commercial Li-ion battery cells with various chemistries and cell capacity sizes ranging from 1. 4 Ah to 45 Ah were studied. Cell abuse may {{have a number of}} consequences. Emissions of toxic and flammable gases have been studied under external heating and fire tests. During such tests cells can vent long time before/without thermal runaway. In external heating abuse tests, three different vents were identified, two of them occurred before the thermal runaway. In case of a delayed ignition of the vented gases mixed with air in a confined/semiconfined space, a gas explosion can occur. The consequences of a gas explosion might be significantly more severe than those of a cell case explosion (explosion due to extreme cell pressure). In external heating tests, 5 of 11 cells underwent a gas explosion, for all levels of cycle ageing studied (0 - 300 deep C/ 2 cycles). Released fluoride gas emissions have been studied by FTIR spectroscopy and gas-washing bottles, a parallel independent method, that verified the total emission amounts. In fire tests, toxic hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas was released with 20 - 200 mg/Wh of nominal electrical energy capacity, according to data from seven types of commercial Li-ion cells at a state of charge (SOC) in the range of 0 - 100 %. The HF production rate in limited fire tests was temporarily increased when water mist was applied as a fire fighting medium, however, the total HF emission values were similar with or without water mist. Emission of POF 3 was also detected in the fire test, but only for one cell type at 0 % SOC. In external heating tests on the same cell type at 100 % SOC, emissions of HF and POF 3 were also detected. The measured amounts indicate that HF might pose a severe and acute toxic threat. Heat spreading from a single Li-ion cell failure to adjacent cells, the cell-to-cell propagation, has been studied both experimentally and by numerical simulations. The use of fire walls between modules can significantly influence the propagation.

Each sample was subjected to three common types of pre-analysis processing methods. For comparative purposes, the first measurement series (MS- 1) was carried out on untreated sediment. In MS- 2, the sediment was rinsed with distilled water. In MS- 3, analyses were carried out on decalcified and rinsed material, in MS- 4 the samples were decalcified without being subsequently washed. Rinsing, irrespective of whether acidification was included (MS- 3) or not (MS- 2), induced substantial modifications in δ 15 N compared to untreated sample splits (MS- 1). Molar Corg/N ratios, on the other hand, were only affected by a combination of acidification and rinsing (MS- 3). Our findings provide strong evidence of ammonium (NH 4 +) being responsible for the discrepancies observed. Firstly, nitrogen isotopes fractionate during NH 4 +-volatilisation in the <b>heating</b> <b>oven,</b> where the sediment is put to desiccate. Thereby, 14 N accumulates in gaseous NH 3, thus leaving 15 N-enriched NH 4 + behind. Secondly, outgassing and concomitant fractionation only concerns NH 4 +-ions dissolved in the interstitial waters of the sediment; NH 4 +-ions adsorbed to negatively-charged SiO 2 -surfaces (in the form of diatom frustrules) escape both the outgassing and fractionation and remain unaffected. Finally, the surface charge and, with it, adsorption capacity of SiO 2 increases with increasing pH of the pore water, hence with increasing carbonate content. Taken together, our findings raise serious doubts about whether untreated sediment (MS- 1) can provide reliable Corg/N and δ 15 N-records in case that NH 4 + is involved. This is because variations in [Corg/N]untreated and δ 15 Nuntreated may result from a misleading influence of NH 4 +, not necessarily having any nutrient-related background. We conclude that excessive confidence in MS- 1 is inappropriate with respect to organic-rich and anoxic deposits, such as the northern Benguela shelf sediments, where NH 4 + is abundantly produced and easily preserved. It is recommended that NH 4 + (both adsorbed and dissolved) be removed prior to measuring Corg/N and δ 15 N. This seems to be done best by a combination of acidification and subsequent rinsing (MS- 3). In order to investigate today’s functioning of the coastal upwelling we compare δ 15 N-records in surface sediments (δ 15 Nsediment) from the central Namibian shelf with suspended particulate matter (δ 15 NSPM) from the surface ocean. Water column profiles provide an insight into changes of δ 15 NSPM with depth and elucidate potential offsets between δ 15 NSPM and δ 15 Nsediment. Investigating spatial and vertical changes in δ 15 N along with temperature and productivity records (e. g. organic carbon and nitrogen contents), and combining data from sediments and suspended matter holds valuable clues to the principle controls on the δ 15 N-signal. Highest δ 15 N-signatures are found right off the coast where water temperatures are lowest. This, together with pronounced nitrate deficits in coastal proximity and oxygen depletion in the bottom waters suggests the upwelling of denitrified source waters. With increasing distance offshore, δ 15 N declines unexpectedly, reaching a minimum above the shelf break. Beyond that, the trend reverses to “normal” with δ 15 N-signals continuously increasing towards the mesopelagic ocean. The decrease in δ 15 Nsediment and surface ocean δ 15 NSPM with increasing distance to the coast disagrees with the concept of Rayleigh fractionation kinetics, viz. the progressive 15 N-enrichment of the nitrate pool as it is gradually used up by phytoplankton growth. Interestingly, the oceanward decline in δ 15 N represents an exact copy of the trend bottom water δ 15 Nnitrate is expected to perform. Apparently, bottom nitrate somehow supports primary production in the photic zone over large areas of the continental shelf. An obvious explanation is that the penetration of wind- and wave-induced mixing is so deep as to tap the varyingly denitrified, subsurface waters. Nutrient replenishment via a second upwelling front at the shelf break represents an alternative scenario that might account for the unanticipated δ 15 N-gradient. Both mechanisms are considered capable of working against the expected nutrient drawdown (i. e. 15 N-enrichment) as surface waters travel offshore. The results help to evaluate the applicability of δ 15 Nsediment as a proxy of past nitrogen cycling, proving particularly useful when it comes to interpreting δ 15 Nsediment-fluctuations in the sediment cores. The cores document climate variability in the northern Benguela Upwelling back to 500 BP with resolutions ranging from multi-decadal (NAM 1) over centennial (core 178) to millennial scale (core 226620). One of the key objectives was to examine the impact of past climate fluctuations on the system in order to assess its vulnerability to climate forcing and {{to gain a better understanding}} of what the system may await in the future. The study rests on nutrient (δ 15 N, δ 13 C) and productivity proxies (accumulation rates of total organic carbon; ARTOC). Reconstructed sea surface temperatures (alkenone-derived SST) and temperatures at subsurface depths (Tδ 18 O; based on foraminiferal calcite) reflect the physical boundary conditions. δ 15 N-records indicate that denitrification seems to have prevailed since the modern shelf circulation system has established. Although the median values of the proxy indicators lie within today’s range, the northern Benguela experienced pronounced and rapid perturbations during the middle and late Holocene, and apparently, not all are purely local in character. Properties and functioning of the northern Benguela system seem to be intimately linked to changes in both atmospheric circulation features and the thermohaline overturn. In this regard, the combined analysis of SST and Tδ 18 O proved a useful tool in order to differentiate between climate signals transferred by the ocean or the atmosphere. SSTs are primarily controlled by the intensity of atmospheric circulation features, reflecting changes of upwelling-favourable winds. Tδ 18 O records the temperature of the source water and often correlates with global ocean conveyor speed due to varying inputs of warm Agulhas Water. Besides that, it seems as though conveyor slowdown or acceleration not only affected the temperature of the source water but also its nutrient content. Predictions concerning region-specific consequences of abrupt changes in NADW-production are still highly speculative. As regards the Benguela system, a severe slowdown of the ocean conveyor may have adverse effects on primary production and the ecosystem as a whole due to deteriorating amounts of nutrients in the source waters...|$|E
