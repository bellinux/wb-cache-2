5|$|As {{the result}} of a 2015 {{referendum}} in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991–2015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation – the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law – a select <b>few</b> <b>will</b> have at least 10 years of incumbency once their term expires.|$|E

Overall, the distinctiveness of mainline Protestant identity has largely dissolved since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Given proper {{multimodality}} treatment, SCLC {{patients with}} limited disease have median survival rates of between 16 and 24 months, and about 20% will be cured. In patients with extensive disease SCLC, although 60% to 70% will have good-to-complete responses to treatment, very <b>few</b> <b>will</b> be cured, {{with a median}} survival of only 6 to 10 months.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} field of {{evolutionary}} biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in evolutionary optimization methods such as genetic algorithms or evolution strategies. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., engineering or logistics problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a delivery truck with a number of destination addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very <b>few</b> <b>will</b> result in a short driving time.|$|E
25|$|The colony {{cycle of}} D. norwegica is short because these species have a {{tendency}} to start in the spring. Their life-history strategy is known as Summer Advantage Strategy (SAS), which is distinctive of the Dolichovespula species. Such a strategy is implemented and used {{to take advantage of the}} short, yet favorable conditions of the summer season. Most colonies will die out after mid August and a <b>few</b> <b>will</b> go till early September. The average number of days a colony exists is 95–115 days.|$|E
25|$|Bridges may be {{classified}} by how {{the forces of}} tension, compression, bending, torsion and shear are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a <b>few</b> <b>will</b> predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among {{a large number of}} members, as in a truss.|$|E

50|$|The {{syllabus}} {{consists of}} several stages. The five-year Nazirah (primary course) teaches Urdu, Persian, Hindi and English. The next level is the Hifze Quran. This involves the memorization of the Quran over {{two to four}} years. A <b>few</b> students <b>will</b> then choose Tajwid e Hafs (melodious recitation). The student is taught the detailed recitation rules of the Quran as laid down by Qari Hafs. Still <b>fewer</b> <b>will</b> take up the next course, the Sab'ah and 'Asharah Qira'at (study of all the ten Quran recitations.|$|R

25|$|Kelpies {{are partly}} descended from Dingoes, with 34% of their genes {{coming from the}} native Australian dog. At {{the time of the}} origin of the breed, it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners {{registered}} their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring. There is no doubt that some people have deliberately mated dingoes to their Kelpies, and some opinion holds that the best dilution is 1/16–1/32, but that 1/2 and 1/4 will work. As the Dingo has been regarded as a savage sheep-killer since the first European settlement of Australia, <b>few</b> <b>will</b> admit to the practice.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{there are}} {{only a small number of}} ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but {{generally}} only a <b>few</b> <b>will</b> be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.|$|E
25|$|After fermentation, the oak barrel aging {{regiment}} {{will vary}} with {{the length of time}} and proportion of new oak barrels that are used. Most Cote de Nuit producers prefer to age their red wines {{for at least a year}} to 18 months and blend lots between barrels of different ages. The traditional barrel used in Burgundy holds 228 liters which is slightly larger than the 225 liters that a traditional Bordeaux wine barrel holds. Prior to bottling, the producer will decide on what, if any fining and filtration methods will be used in the clarification and stabilization of the wine. Some producers will use both, others will fine and not filter and a <b>few</b> <b>will</b> choose to use neither, believing that they can reduce the complexity of the wine even though the wine may have a higher risk of spoilage and instability.|$|E

25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in. In the dream world, the player is able to leave the room, which {{will lead to a}} nexus of 12 doors, with each leading to a different world, including a colorful neon maze, a forest, a world littered with numerical symbols, and a world full of body parts, among others. These 12 worlds, in turn, connect to a number of other worlds, forming a large and expansive area for the player to explore. The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although <b>few</b> <b>will</b> provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki to pinch her cheek and awaken. This behavior ensures that the player has {{a way out of the}} dream world at all times.|$|E

5000|$|Only a very <b>few</b> <b>wills</b> are contested: {{their success}} rate {{is less than}} 1%.

This may help reduce the amount of herbicides needed for weed control.|$|R
500|$|Fred Beldin of AllMovie is critical, {{summing up}} Prey as a [...] "dismal, unsettling film" [...] with [...] "occasional arthouse pretensions" [...] that is [...] "difficult to watch even for {{exploitation}} fans". He notes the film's unrelenting tension and [...] "claustrophia", remarking: [...] "deaths seem like appropriate punctuation {{at the end}} of a miserable sentence, giving the film a grim tone of hopelessness that <b>few</b> <b>will</b> derive pleasure from". He criticises Sally Faulkner's performance as being [...] "particularly grating". By contrast, Newman and Marriott praise the [...] "surprisingly good turns" [...] from Stokes, Annen and Faulkner.|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} Edgar Allan Poe was buried, a long {{obituary}} {{appeared in the}} New York Tribune signed [...] "Ludwig". It was soon published throughout the country. The piece began, [...] "Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but <b>few</b> <b>will</b> be grieved by it." [...] "Ludwig" [...] was soon identified as Rufus Wilmot Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court was, in one historian's words, [...] "bitterly divided" [...] on the First Amendment issues {{presented}} by Dennis. Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas dissented {{from the majority}} opinion. In his dissent, Black wrote [...] "public opinion being what it now is, <b>few</b> <b>will</b> protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners. There is hope, however, that, in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society."

500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect <b>few</b> <b>will</b> have the patience to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E
500|$|For Dunne, the Dooley {{pieces were}} a burden, {{but one that}} brought him fame and money, neither of which was enough to keep him at his desk once he gained the Whitney legacy. Before he died in 1936, Dunne knew that {{interest}} in the Dooley pieces was fading, and this saddened him. [...] Understanding that readers were having trouble with the Irish dialect, he experimented with translating the columns into ordinary English, but published none in that form. In 1938, The New Republic noted in an article, [...] "if you try quoting Mr. Dooley's brogue to the average listener you will be rewarded {{with a look of}} intense pain. But if you translate Mr. Dooley into ordinary English nearly everything precipitates out as pure wisdom." [...] Ellis, writing in 1941, argued, [...] "that the Dooley essays are journalism of the finest type <b>few</b> <b>will</b> dispute; that they are literature in the more permanent sense may not be so clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and growing language there might be no doubt about it, but Mr. Dooley's language has become at least obsolescent, and that puts the future of the Dooley essay in serious question." [...] Ellis noted that attempts to imitate Dunne's success with other Irish-dialect columns failed, and suggested the brogue was not essential to the originals' [...] popularity, [...] "Dunne's essays lose nothing today when translated into ordinary English words".|$|E
