5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Occurring <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> after Cyclone Paula {{affected}} Vanuatu, Sose compounded {{the damage}} already {{done by the}} previous storm, especially to crops and farmlands. Throughout the island chain, two people lost their lives to the storm. Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters, while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined. The storm destroyed about 200 homes around the nation and damaged many more, particularly on southern Espiritu Santo. The storm's large fetch generated enormous swells {{as far away as}} Australia's Eastern Seaboard, where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned. On Maré Island in New Caledonia, a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead. The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand, sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died. Another individual drowned in a swollen river. Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga. In all, Sose killed nine people; total monetary damage is unknown.

In Victoria de Las Tunas, a rainfall total of 8.6inches (21.8cm) set the new record most rainfall in 24hours. The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams, and in some places, residents required rescue from the roofs of their houses. Officials forced the evacuation of 40,000people in several provinces, and across the country, the storm destroyed 1,860homes and damaged 16,500more. The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province, and in Las Tunas Province railway lines were damaged. Widespread crop damage occurred <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> after the Storm of the Century left similar heavy damage. The flooding damaged 87sugar production centers.
