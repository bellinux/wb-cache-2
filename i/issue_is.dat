5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff {{is not limited to the}} lower river; the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{and again}} during the 1950s, the {{relationship}} between the loanable funds doctrine and the liquidity preference theory were discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent but this <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> still unresolved.|$|E
50|$|Anne Bonnie is an American {{comic book}} created, written, and {{illustrated}} by Tim Yates. The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> published by Blue Juice Comics on March 19, 2014. Additional <b>issues</b> have <b>been</b> published on an irregular schedule. In December 2015, the first six <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> collected into a trade paperback. Additional <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> scheduled for 2017.|$|R
50|$|The magazine's last <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> in November 1937. In all, 367 <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} {{during its}} 30-year life.|$|R
25|$|During {{this last}} phase of Byzantine coinage gold <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{discontinued}} {{and a regular}} silver <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> commenced. The denomination <b>was</b> the Stavraton <b>issued</b> in 1, a half, an eighth and a 16th of its value. Also <b>issued</b> <b>were</b> the copper follaro and tornesse.|$|R
5|$|Oriel College {{also has}} its own student-run publication, The Poor Print. The Poor Print publishes a range of content, {{including}} news, poetry, photography, science, comment, drawing, music, events and entertainment. Each <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> based around a theme, decided upon by the editors, and content comes from members of all common rooms and the College staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the filtering {{capacity of}} the lung system. Small bubbles may pass through the lungs into the systemic circulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} is distributed within the U.S. Weekend Edition of The Wall Street Journal newspaper (paid print circulation for the Weekend edition is +2.2 million*), the European and Asian editions, {{and is available}} on WSJ.com. Each <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> also available throughout the month in The Wall Street Journal’s iPad app.|$|E
50|$|In total, 5 <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} in 2016. Of these, 4 <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> planned, 1 <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> a special <b>issue.</b> All articles of issues for 2016 entered the RSCI, which is confirmed {{on the website}} of the RSCI. There is no statistics on citation.|$|R
50|$|These {{are known}} to have <b>been</b> <b>issued</b> during the 1890s, but the dates of when they began to <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> and ceased to <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> <b>is</b> not yet known, as {{information}} about these <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> extremely sketchy.|$|R
50|$|Past <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} online at the BEA web site. Archives of past <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> also available from other sources.|$|R
5|$|The main {{threats to}} the park's {{biodiversity}} are wood extraction and forest clearing for agriculture and pastures. A large <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the rejection by some local inhabitants of the new park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} (Cr(III)) ion is {{an essential}} nutrient in trace amounts in humans for insulin, sugar and lipid metabolism, although the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> debated.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> how {{to design}} protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use}} of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E
50|$|Coins <b>were</b> <b>issued</b> in {{denominations}} of 1, 3, 5 and 10 marka between 1922 and 1926. The 1922 <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{struck in}} cupro-nickel whilst the later <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> in nickel-bronze.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} August 3, 2011, {{and quickly}} sold {{out at the}} distributor level, prompting Moore to announce a second printing eight days later. A third printing of the first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> released for the 2014 Halloween ComicFest. New <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> released approximately six weeks apart.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> edited by Robert Grenier and Barrett Watten (1971-1973). The {{subsequent}} nine <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> edited by Watten (1973-1982).|$|R
5|$|A related <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{increasing}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> {{the rise}} in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family.|$|E
50|$|Three <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} in Electronic Gaming Monthly. Each issue consisted of four full-color pages. The <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> numbered 43 through 45.|$|R
50|$|The initial <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} by Dynamite Entertainment in September 2011. New <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> published {{at a rate}} of one per month.|$|R
500|$|Nebula {{was printed}} in large digest format, [...] [...] The first three <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> 120 pages; this {{increased}} to 128 pages {{for the next}} three issues, to 130 pages for issue 7, and to 136 pages for issue 8. [...] Issues 9 through 12 were 128 pages, and the remaining <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> 112 pages. [...] The <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> numbered consecutively throughout; the first eight <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> given volume numberings as well, with two volumes of four numbers each.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> that Murray cod {{caught and}} {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs {{and do not}} spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> {{the role}} of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor {{has been linked to}} anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not {{film the}} scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> digest-sized, with 132 pages, {{and were}} priced at 35 cents. The <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{numbered}} {{as a single}} volume with two issues.|$|R
50|$|Paläontologische Zeitschrift is a {{periodical}} {{focused on}} palaeontology {{and published by}} the palaeontological society of Germany ("Paläontologische Gesellschaft"). The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> printed in 1912. Till 1998 two <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> brought out each year. From there on out 4 <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> published each year. Starting in 2009 the periodical was published by Springer.|$|R
50|$|Tux {{was not a}} print magazine: each <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} digitally as a PDF file. The {{magazine was}} established in 2004. The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> published on February 1, 2005 and further 19 issues followed almost every month. On January 1, 2007, the publisher announced that the December 2006 <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> the last for the moment, because financial and other issues required a re-evaluation of how to best serve the reader community. All <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> still obtainable from the Tux Magazine website.|$|R
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} {{has developed}} over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> reached.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E
50|$|Garage was a music fanzine {{based in}} Dunedin, New Zealand, {{which was created}} and edited by {{journalist}} Richard Langston. Six <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> published during the 1980s.
