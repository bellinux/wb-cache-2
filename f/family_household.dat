25|$|On 8 May 1775, Morris {{was elected}} to {{represent}} his <b>family</b> <b>household</b> in southern Westchester County (now Bronx County), in the New York Provincial Congress. As {{a member of the}} congress, he, along with most of his fellow delegates, concentrated on turning the colony into an independent state. However, his advocacy of independence brought him into conflict with his family, as well as with his mentor, William Smith, who had abandoned the patriot cause when it pressed toward independence. Morris {{was a member of the}} New York State Assembly in 1777–78.|$|E
25|$|The Diaspora {{population}} of Ireland {{also got a}} fresh start on the islands of New Zealand during the later half of the 19th century. The ideology of striking it rich in the gold mines caused many Irish people to flock to the docks; risking {{their lives on the}} long voyage to potential freedom and more importantly self-sufficiency. Most famous places including both Gabriel's Gully and Otago are examples of mining sites which, with the funding of large companies, allowed for the creation of wages and the appearance of mining towns. Women found jobs as housemaids cleaning the shacks of the single men at work thereby providing a second income to the Irish <b>family</b> <b>household.</b> The subsequent money accumulated with regards to this would allow for chain migration {{for the rest of the}} family left behind.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{at the military}} academy, Chávez generally avoided all discussion of politics with his family, especially whenever he stayed with them during holidays. He particularly disliked political discussion with his father, who was then {{a member of the}} COPEI political party—indeed, his father would eventually rise to the position of Education Director of Barinas during the COPEI administration of Luis Herrera Campins. However, Chávez did enjoy such talk during his regular visits to the Ruiz <b>family</b> <b>household.</b> For several months during 1974, Chávez maintained a personal diary; in it, he was careful in his usage of proper Spanish language. Chávez also expressed a leftist political orientation; writing of his dislike of U.S. foreign policy and Venezuela's perceived lack of a distinct national or cultural identity. As an example, he noted that both Venezuela's national sport (baseball) and Venezuela's popular music ultimately were American in origin.|$|E

The 1891 Buckingham census shows Phipps on the Royal Artillery retired list and living at a country manor house, The Stone, with his sons, 21-year-old Edmund, {{a student at}} Oxford University, and 16-year-old Henry, a student at Wellington, and 14-year-old Gertrude. Four servants supported this small family, including a cook, a lady's maid for Gertrude, a housemaid, and a scullery maid. [...] In 1901, Henry had left the <b>family</b> <b>household,</b> but Edmund and Gertrude still lived with their father in St. Giles. Phipps remained at The Stone until 1920.|$|E
500|$|The episode then cuts {{back to the}} Griffin <b>family</b> <b>household,</b> with Peter {{immediately}} rehashing {{the argument}} between him and Chris that first started in [...] "Blue Harvest", a joke grounded {{in the fact that}} Chris' voice actor, Seth Green, is one of the creators and producers of the stop motion comedy series Robot Chicken. Peter begins by suggesting that Robot Chicken {{would never be able to}} top the story he had just told. Hearing this, Chris defends Robot Chicken. Peter continues to poke at Chris and finally states that he [...] "may have more time to tell another story" [...] entitled Without a Paddle, a critically panned movie in which Seth Green starred. Chris then angrily storms off yelling [...] "Fuck you" [...] to Peter.|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} of Republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent {{reflected}} that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the conquest of Greece brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves into Rome. Slaves were also traded in markets, and sometimes sold by pirates. Infant abandonment and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources. Vernae, by contrast, were [...] "homegrown" [...] slaves born to female slaves within the urban household or on a country estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his vernae faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of his familia, the <b>family</b> <b>household,</b> {{and in some cases}} might actually be the children of free males in the family.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{studies the}} evolution {{of different types of}} <b>households,</b> especially <b>family</b> <b>households,</b> based on various demographic indicators and according to various criteria and data sources from the 2 nd half of 20 th century. An important year for the concept of this thesis is the year 1961, when was first census performed in the concept of census households. The theoretical section explains important concepts, data sources and historical evolution of <b>families</b> and <b>households,</b> and current trends in the formation of these households. It also explains the severance of households, and the last section deals with the <b>family</b> <b>households.</b> The analytical part compares demographic indicators such as demographic structure between 1961 and 2011 and the marriage rate. Furthermore, there are analyzed various type of households, but particularly the <b>family</b> <b>households,</b> according to different data sources and different characteristics. The last part of this chapter deals with the forecast number of <b>family</b> <b>households</b> in the future...|$|R

500|$|In 1905, Minna and the {{children}} emigrated to the United States, where they joined Isaac in Rockland, Maine. Isaac initially struggled to establish himself there, suffering from depression while the family settled into their new home. He worked as a woodcutter before opening a junkyard. His work as a lumberjack made wood a consistent presence in the <b>family</b> <b>household,</b> a material that would figure prominently in Nevelson's work. Eventually he became a successful lumberyard owner and realtor. The family had another child, Lillian, in 1906. Nevelson {{was very close to}} her mother, who suffered from depression, a condition believed to be brought on by the family's migration from Russia and their minority status as a Jewish family living in Maine. Minna overly compensated for this, dressing herself and {{the children}} up in clothing [...] "regarded as sophisticated in the Old Country". Her mother wore flamboyant outfits with heavy make-up; Nevelson described her mother's [...] "dressing up" [...] as [...] "art, her pride, and her job", also describing her as someone who should have lived [...] "in a palace".|$|E
2500|$|Family {{types of}} pre-industrial Europe belonged into two basic groups, the [...] "simple {{household}} system" [...] (the nuclear family), and the [...] "joint family system" [...] (the extended family). A simple household system featured a relatively late age of marriage {{for both men}} and women and the establishment of a separate household after the marriage or neolocality. [...] A joint <b>family</b> <b>household</b> system was characterized by earlier marriage for women, co-residence with the husband's family or patrilocality, and co-residing of multiple generations. Many households consisted of unrelated servants and apprentices residing for periods of years, and at that time, belonging to the family. Due to shorter life expectancy and high mortality rates in the pre-industrialized world, much of the structure of a family depended on the average age of the marriage of women. Late marriages, as occurred in the simple household system, left little time for three-generation families to form. Conversely, in the joint <b>family</b> <b>household</b> system, early marriages allowed for multi-generational families to form.|$|E

George Hunsinger summarizes the influence of von Kirschbaum on Barth's work: [...] "As his unique student, critic, researcher, adviser, collaborator, companion, assistant, spokesperson, and confidante, Charlotte von Kirschbaum was indispensable to him.

2500|$|A Deluminator is {{a device}} invented by Albus Dumbledore {{that resembles a}} {{cigarette}} lighter. It is used to remove or absorb (as well as return) the light from any light source to provide cover to the user. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator (then {{referred to as the}} Put-Outer) to darken Privet Drive, where the Dursley <b>family</b> <b>household</b> is located. It was next seen in Order of the Phoenix where Dumbledore loans the Deluminator to Moody, who uses it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore uses the Deluminator again to darken Privet Drive before collecting Harry.|$|E
2500|$|Failure {{to adhere}} to the {{directions}} on shunning is itself considered a serious offense. Members who continue to speak to or associate with a disfellowshipped or disassociated person are said to be sharing in their [...] "wicked works" [...] and may themselves be disfellowshipped. Exceptions are made in some cases, such as business relations and immediate <b>family</b> <b>household</b> situations. If a disfellowshipped person is living in the same home with other baptized family members, religious matters are not discussed, with the exception of minors, for whose training parents are still responsible. Disfellowshipped family members outside the home are shunned. Disfellowshipped individuals can continue attending public meetings held at the Kingdom Hall, though they are shunned by the congregation.|$|E
6000|$|Having thus {{provided}} himself, like a pedlar, {{with a heavy}} knapsack, wherewith to regale {{his shoulders}} through the journey of life, he literally sets out on the peregrination. His whole <b>family,</b> <b>household</b> furniture, and farming utensils are hoisted into a covered cart; his own and his wife's wardrobe packed up in a firkin; which done, he shoulders his axe, takes his staff in hand, whistles [...] "Yankee doodle," [...] and trudges off to the woods, as confident of the protection of Providence, and relying as cheerfully upon his own resources, as did ever a patriarch of yore, when he journeyed into a strange country of the Gentiles. Having buried himself in the wilderness, he builds himself a log hut, clears away a corn-field and potato patch, and, Providence smiling upon his labors, is soon surrounded by a snug farm and some half a score of flaxen-headed urchins, who, by their size, seem to have sprung all at once {{out of the earth}} like a crop of toadstools.|$|E

60|$|The large parlor {{was like}} many {{that you and}} I have seen in a certain respectable class of houses,--wide, cool, shady, and with a mellow old tone to every thing in its {{furniture}} and belongings. It was a parlor of the past, and not of to-day, yet exquisitely neat and well-kept. The Turkey carpet was faded: it {{had been part of}} the wedding furnishing of Grace's mother, years ago. The great, wide, motherly, chintz-covered sofa, which filled a recess commanding the window, was as different as possible from any smart modern article of the name. The heavy, claw-footed, mahogany chairs; the tall clock that ticked in one corner; the footstools and ottomans in faded embroidery,--all spoke of days past. So did the portraits on the wall. One was of a fair, rosy young girl, in a white gown, with powdered hair dressed high over a cushion. It was the portrait of Grace's mother. Another was that of a minister in gown and bands, with black-silk gloved hands holding up conspicuously a large Bible. This was the remote ancestor, the minister. Then there was the picture of John's father, placed lovingly where the eyes seemed always to be following the slight, white-robed figure of the young wife. The walls were papered with an old-fashioned paper of a peculiar pattern, bought in France seventy-five years before. The vases of India-china that adorned the mantels, the framed engravings of architecture and pictures in Rome, all were memorials of the taste of those long passed away. Yet the room had a fresh, sweet, sociable air. The roses and honeysuckles looked in at the windows; the table covered with books and magazines, and the familiar work-basket of Miss Grace, with its work, gave a sort of impression of modern <b>family</b> <b>household</b> life. It was a wide, open, hospitable, generous-minded room, that seemed to breathe a fragrance of invitation and general sociability; it was a room full of associations and memories, and its daily arrangement and ornamentation made one of the pleasant tasks of Miss Grace's life.|$|E
