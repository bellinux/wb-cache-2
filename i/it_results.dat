5|$|A lung {{contusion}} is {{a bruise}} caused by chest trauma. <b>It</b> <b>results</b> in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair breathing, {{and this can}} be either mild or severe.|$|E
5|$|In the {{inertial}} effect, {{the lighter}} alveolar tissue is sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in head injury. <b>It</b> <b>results</b> {{from the fact that}} different tissues have different densities, and therefore different rates of acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of many red flags are poorly supported by evidence. The most useful for detecting a fracture are: older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma especially if <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in skin markings.

5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E

5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. <b>It</b> <b>results</b> from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Here {{constant}} α quantifies {{the strength}} of the interaction between adjacent molecules.

5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car crash that kills a mother and her daughter. Although Susan was driving, Mike takes the blame, as Susan did not have her license with her at the time. Susan feels incredibly guilty for taking the lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), but Mike insists it was not their fault. The argument over the topic becomes so great that <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E
5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has {{a thick layer}} of ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. <b>It</b> <b>results</b> in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria will be {{used for}} cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>results</b> in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. <b>It</b> <b>results</b> in a decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is {{primarily because of}} its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. <b>It</b> <b>results</b> in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because <b>it</b> <b>results</b> from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
