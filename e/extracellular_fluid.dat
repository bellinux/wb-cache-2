5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol are quite different from those in <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E
50|$|The pH of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> {{can thus}} be {{controlled}} by separately regulating the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (which determines the carbonic acid concentration) and bicarbonate ion concentration in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sodium is {{the primary}} cation (positive ion) in <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> in animals and humans. These fluids, such as blood plasma and <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> in other tissues, bathe cells and carry out {{transport}} functions for nutrients and wastes. Sodium is also the principal cation in seawater, although the concentration there is about 3.8 times what it is normally in <b>extracellular</b> body <b>fluids.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid,</b> cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
50|$|In {{the living}} body this {{principle}} is exploited {{to regulate the}} pH of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> (rather than just buffering the pH). For the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer, a molar ratio of weak acid to weak base of 1:20 produces a pH of 7.4; and vice versa: when the pH of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> is 7.4 then the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonate ions in that fluid is 1:20.|$|R
5000|$|This {{relationship}} is described mathematically by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which, {{when applied to}} the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids,</b> states that: ...|$|R
50|$|The pH of the body's <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> is {{normally}} tightly regulated by buffering agents, the respiratory system, and the renal system, keeping the pH of the arterial blood plasma between 7.36 and 7.42.|$|R
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the kidney}} cannot {{directly}} sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly {{depends upon the}} kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. Renin {{is the first in}} a series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin-angiotensin system. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{could act}} centrally, {{as well as}} peripherally, {{to assist in the}} {{normalization}} of <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> volume by regulating body’s action to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Centrally, glucocorticoids could inhibit dehydration induced water intake; peripherally, glucocorticoids could induce a potent diuresis.|$|E
40|$|Regulation of <b>extracellular</b> {{volume and}} <b>fluid</b> {{composition}} provides a robust microenvironment for brain cells. In peripheral tissue, fluid surplus and solutes {{are removed from}} the interstitium via drainage into lymphatic channels. Since {{the central nervous system}} lacks a proper lymphatic vasculature, a substantial part of this drainage may occur along paravascular spaces. The aim of the thesis was to investigate the physiology of brain <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> and their possible role in the removal of solutes from the central nervous system. Using imaging techniques, we revealed a continuous and extensive CSF compartment, in which solutes move, driven by bulk flow and mixing. Furthermore, we suggested that an increased flux of ions and water, associated with hypertension, {{may play a role in}} the filtering and accumulation of endogenous waste products in the brain. We also introduced a new and more subtle approach in studying interstitial fluid flow. To conclude, the research presented in this thesis shed light on the physiology and dynamics of <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> in the brain and has provided directions for future investigations that could reveal the link between hypertension, <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> and Alzheimer’s disease...|$|R
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} species, {{the concentration}} of plasma electrolytes determines {{to a great extent}} the physical properties of <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids.</b> The bicarbonate ion is under respiratory control, but the other electrolytes, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and sulphate are regulated by the kidney. Maintenance of normal plasma values of the various ions is an indication of the degree of success attained by the regulatory mechanisms of the kidney (129). Intracellular fluids are in osmotic equilibrium with the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids.</b> Sodium is the dominant kation of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids,</b> while potassium is the chief cellular base. The degree of hydration in the two main divisions of body water depends upon the relative proportions of sodium and potassium. The water of the body is in a dynamic state, in which an exchange of water freely occurs across cell membranes to meet the exigencies of the continually occurring processes of metabolism (425, 74, 315). A historical review of the literature concerning the role played by the endocrine glands in the metabolism of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium and phosphorus follows in the next section...|$|R
50|$|The {{volume of}} water in the body is {{measured}} by atrial volume receptors, low-pressure baroreceptors in the heart, and, somewhat indirectly, by the measurement of the plasma osmolality by the hypothalamus. Measurement of the plasma osmolality to give an indication of the water content of the body, relies on the fact that water losses from the body, through sweat, gut fluids (normal fecal water losses, and through vomiting and diarrhea), and the exhaled air, are all hypotonic, meaning that they are less salty than the body fluids (compare, for instance, the taste of saliva with that of tears. The latter have almost the same salt content as the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids,</b> whereas the former is hypotonic with respect to plasma. Saliva does not taste salty, whereas tears are decidedly salty). Nearly all normal and abnormal losses of body water therefore cause the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> to become hyperosmolar. Conversely excessive water intake (in the form of most regular beverages) dilutes the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> causing the hypothalamus to register hypo-osmolar conditions.|$|R
25|$|Reduction {{of blood}} volume by ANP {{can result in}} {{secondary}} effects such as reduction of <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> (ECF) volume (edema), improved cardiac ejection fraction with resultant improved organ perfusion, decreased blood pressure, and increased serum potassium. These effects may be blunted or negated by various counter-regulatory mechanisms operating concurrently {{on each of these}} secondary effects.|$|E
25|$|The kidney {{participates in}} whole-body homeostasis, {{regulating}} acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and {{in concert with}} other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.|$|E
25|$|Theophylline is {{distributed}} in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid,</b> in the placenta, in the mother's milk and in the central nervous system. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg. The protein binding is 40%. The volume of distribution may increase in neonates and those suffering from cirrhosis or malnutrition, whereas the volume of distribution may decrease in those who are obese.|$|E

30|$|After {{intravascular}} administration, CM {{are distributed}} rapidly over intravascular and <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids,</b> i.e. the CM {{have a short}} distribution half-life (t½d). Usually, {{the time for the}} CM to distribute evenly over the fluids is several minutes, ranging from 2 to 30  min. Plasma protein binding is approximately 1 - 3  % [16].|$|R
25|$|Renin (etymology and pronunciation), {{also known}} as an angiotensinogenase, is a serine {{protease}} protein and enzyme secreted by the kidneys that participates in the body's renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)—{{also known as}} the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis—that mediates the volume of <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> (blood plasma, lymph and interstitial fluid), and arterial vasoconstriction. Thus, it regulates the body's mean arterial blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin is {{administered}} through an intravenous device, intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action {{depends on the}} mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid.</b> It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|First {{messengers}} are the signaling molecules (hormones, neurotransmitters, and paracrine/autocrine agents) {{that reach}} the cell from the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> and bind to their specific receptors. Second messengers are the substances that enter the cytoplasm and act within the cell {{to trigger a}} response. In essence, second messengers serve as chemical relays from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, thus carrying out intracellular signal transduction.|$|E

Neutrophil elastase has broad substrate specificity, capable of cleavin...|$|R
50|$|Humoral {{immunity}} or humoural immunity is {{the aspect}} of immunity that is mediated by macromolecules found in <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> such as secreted antibodies, complement proteins, and certain antimicrobial peptides. Humoral immunity is so named because it involves substances found in the humors, or body fluids. It contrasts with cell-mediated immunity. Its aspects involving antibodies are often called antibody-mediated immunity.|$|R

25|$|Venipuncture {{is useful}} {{as it is}} a {{minimally}} invasive way to obtain cells and <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> (plasma) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium which provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects, or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests.|$|E

Once the viral proteins are assembled into virions, the assembled virions leave the nucleus and migrate towards the cell membrane.

25|$|Potassium is {{the most}} {{abundant}} intracellular cation and about 98% of the body's potassium is found inside cells, with the remainder in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluid</b> including the blood. Membrane potential is maintained principally by the concentration gradient and membrane permeability to potassium with some contribution from the Na+/K+ pump. The potassium gradient is critically important for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cellular membrane potential, homeostasis of cell volume, and transmission of action potentials in nerve cells.|$|E

The one- and two-electron oxidized forms of vitamin C, semidehydroascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid, respectively, can be reduced in the body by glutathione and NADPH-dependent enzymatic mechanisms. The presence of glutathione in cells and <b>extracellular</b> <b>fluids</b> helps maintain ascorbate in a reduced state.|$|R
