40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} U-type, column-orthogonal and nearly column-orthogonal designs. Nearly column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> very useful {{in cases where}} column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> not known. New <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> {{obtained}} which are suitable for screening experiments. In certain cases, the constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> shown to be optimal {{with respect to their}} aliased structure. The aliased structures, of U-type, column-orthogonal and nearly column-orthogonal <b>designs,</b> <b>are</b> calculated and presented in closed form. This fact makes the new approach innovating and enables the construction of <b>designs</b> that <b>are</b> different from the designs constructed in the literature. An extended multiplication theorem and new infinite families of column-orthogonal <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> presented using periodic Golay pairs...|$|R
40|$|The STEP {{electronic}} system <b>design</b> <b>is</b> discussed. The {{purpose of the}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> outlined. The {{electronic system}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> summarized and it is found that: an effective conceptual system <b>design</b> <b>is</b> developed; the <b>design</b> represents {{a unique set of}} capabilities; makes efficient use of available orbiter resources; the system capabilities exceed identified potential experiment needs...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{efficient}} and economical response surface <b>designs</b> that can <b>be</b> constructed using known <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The proposed class of <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> {{a modification of}} the Central Composite Designs, in which the axial points of the traditional central composite <b>design</b> <b>are</b> replaced by some edge points of the hypercube that circumscribes the sphere of zero center and radius a. An algorithm {{for the construction of}} these <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> developed and applied. The constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> suitable for sequential experimentation and have higherD-values than those of known composite designs. The properties of the constructed <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> further discussed and evaluated in terms of rotatability, blocking, and D-optimality under the full second-order mode...|$|R
5|$|The <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared}} in-house at the Philadelphia Mint by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, {{who designed}} the obverse and his assistant, George T. Morgan, who prepared the reverse. They did not seek outside artists to submit proposals. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggested that this was because Secretary McAdoo had sought non-employees to propose designs for the five Panama-Pacific coins along with those sketches prepared by Barber and his assistants, and the Mint's engravers had prepared {{only two of the}} five, and that because the artist assigned one, Evelyn Longman, had fallen ill. When the McKinley <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts on March 31, 1916, it recommended changes, though Don Taxay, who so stated, does not say what they were. In any event, no alteration was made, and the <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> approved.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{character}} <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> {{drawn by}} Etsushi Sajima and {{were based on}} the original designs by Suzuhito Yasuda which received praise from Director Kishi. The original designs of the Septentriones were created by Mohiro Kitoh who remarked that since he was not directly engaged in the production process, he had to wait until the finished product was released before he could see the animated versions of his designs. The other half of the series' creatures i.e. the various devils (demons) used were designed by Hiroyuki Kanbe, while prop <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> done by Hatsue Nakayama and color <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> done by Keiichi Funada. Finally leaving Kazuto Shimoyama to oversee this area of production as the art director. The musical score was composed by Kōtarō Nakagawa. Nakagawa was initially surprised to have been offered to be the musical composer but took up the role as a challenge. In addition to Nagakawa, Sound Direction was done by Satoki Iida along with Sound Effects by Iki Okuda. Other staff members included Assistant Director Yoshimichi Hirai, Animation Designer Eriko Ito, Composite Director Katsufumi Sato, CG Director Yuji Koshida and Ayumu Takahashi as the series Editor and Producer Yasuo Suda.|$|E

Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School. He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> produced as commercial ventures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{supersaturated}} <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially a}} factorial design with the equal oc-currence of levels property and no fully aliased factors {{in which the}} number of main ef-fects {{is greater than the}} number of runs. It has received much recent interest because of its potential in factor screening experiments. A packing <b>design</b> <b>is</b> an important object in combinatorial design theory. In this paper, a strong link between the two apparently un-related kinds of <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> shown. Several criteria for comparing supersaturated <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> proposed, their properties and connections with other existing criteria are discussed. A combinatorial approach, called the packing method, for constructing optimal supersatu-rated <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> presented, and properties of the resulting <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> also investigated. Comparisons between the new designs and other existing <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> given, which show that our construction method and the newly constructed designs have good properties...|$|R
40|$|A-optimality of block {{designs for}} control versus test {{comparisons}} in diallel crosses is investigated. A sufficient condition for <b>designs</b> to <b>be</b> A-optimal is derived.

5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> suitable.|$|E
40|$|Experimental <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a {{powerful}} tool for quality improvement. In some situations, however, the <b>design</b> variables <b>are</b> subject to multiple linear constraints. In this report, we propose a class called projection <b>designs</b> which can <b>be</b> used when the <b>design</b> variables <b>are</b> constrained by linear relations. Fundamental issues such as region of interest and scaling of <b>design</b> variables <b>are</b> discussed. Then the construction of projection <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> illustrated...|$|R
40|$|A robust {{process is}} a process that is {{insensitive}} to changes in uncontrollable variables. In this article a class of <b>designs</b> that can <b>be</b> used to achieve a robust process is proposed. These new <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> similar in structure to classical central composite <b>designs,</b> but they <b>are</b> of mixed resolution. That <b>is,</b> the new <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> at least Resolution V among the signal factors and are at least Resolution I 11 among the noise factors. A catalog of the new designs, known as composite mixed-resolution (CMR) <b>designs,</b> <b>is</b> included for the practitioner. A comparison of the sizes of robustness designs shows that many CMR <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> superior to or competitive with the corresponding Taguchi designs. The response surface models associated with these two classes of robustness <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> also compared. D efficiencies and G efficiencies of the CMR <b>designs</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R

5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series and the image illustrations from Final FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, character <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character designer for Final FantasyXI, and Yoshida served as character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Square-produced Vagrant Story, and Final FantasyXII.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{optimality}} {{criterion of}} most optimal <b>designs</b> <b>is</b> {{based on some}} function of the information matrix, the 'optimality' of a given <b>design</b> <b>is</b> model dependent: While an optimal <b>design</b> <b>is</b> best for that model, its performance may deteriorate on other models. On other models, an optimal <b>design</b> can <b>be</b> either better or worse than a non-optimal <b>design.</b> Therefore, it <b>is</b> important to benchmark the performance of designs under alternative models.|$|R

5|$|Following on {{from the}} site selection, the Scottish Office {{announced}} that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament. A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as Rafael Viñoly, Michael Wilford and Richard Meier. Twelve <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final <b>designs</b> <b>were</b> put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect Enric Miralles were amongst the most popular. The design team took account of public opinion on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.|$|E
