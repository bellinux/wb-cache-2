[...] They then sailed to King George's Sound in south west Australia, a dismal settlement then being replaced by the Swan River Colony. Darwin {{was impressed}} by the [...] "good disposition of the aboriginal blacks... Although true Savages, it is impossible not to feel an inclination to like such quiet good-natured men." [...] He provided boiled rice for an aboriginal [...] "Corrobery" [...] dancing party performed by the men of two tribes to the great pleasure of the women and children, a [...] "most rude barbarous scene" [...] in which everyone appeared in high spirits, [...] "all moving in hideous harmony" [...] and [...] "perfectly at their ease". The Beagles departure in a storm was delayed when she ran aground. She was refloated and got on her way.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards {{some of the}} Pelasgians who {{inhabited}} Thessaly, {{as it is now}} called, being {{obliged to}} leave their country, settled among the Aborigines and jointly with them made war upon the Sicels. It is possible that the Aborigines received them partly in the hope of gaining their assistance, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> chiefly on account of their kinship; for the Pelasgians, too, were a Greek nation originally from the Peloponnesus ...|$|E

Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight, {{remembered how}} they were {{impressed}} when they tested the Veltro. “One of the finest aircraft I ever flew was the Macchi MC. 205. Oh, beautiful. And here you had the perfect combination of Italian styling and German engineering. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> powered by a Daimler Benz DB 605. It was really a delight to fly, and up to anything on the Allied programme. But again, it came just before the Italians capitulated so it was never used extensively. And we did tests on it and were most impressed. The cockpit was smallish but {{not as bad as}} the Bf 109.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{was often}} bothered {{by what she}} viewed as Sackville-West's promiscuity, {{charging}} that Sackville-West's need for sex led her to take up with anyone who struck her fancy. [...] Sackville-West had a stronger desire for sex and a greater willingness {{to talk about her}} desires than did Woolf, which caused tensions, though Woolf wrote to Sackville-West in 1928 that [...] "The sound of your loud balmy voice coming across the marshes last night...stirred the embers of my desire". When Nicolson was stationed at the British Embassy in Berlin, Sackville-West followed him to Berlin, which was considered a more livable city for a British woman than Tehran. When Woolf went to Berlin to see Sackville-West, she became seriously ill which led Sackville-West to tell her: [...] "Do you know what <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> apart from the flu? It was SUPPRESSED RANDINESS. So there-you remember your admissions as the searchlight went around and around?" [...] In her 1929 novel A Room Of One's Own, Woolf attacks patriarchal inheritance laws, which was meant to be an implicit criticism of Sackville-West, who keenly resented that she did not inherit Knole, but never questioned the leading social position of the aristocracy to which she belonged, much to Woolf's annoyance, who felt that Sackville-West was unable to critique the system she was both a part of and to a certain extent a victim of.|$|E
