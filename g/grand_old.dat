25|$|The area, {{which was}} settled by Europeans in the 19th century {{and used as}} pasture, made a slow {{transition}} to a residential suburb which was complete by the mid 20th century. Much of the area's 19th century housing stock has been recognised with heritage protection. Dulwich's close location to the Adelaide city centre, <b>grand</b> <b>old</b> houses and leafy tree-lined streets make it an attractive and sought-after suburb.|$|E

25|$|The Republican Party, {{commonly}} referred to as the GOP (abbreviation for <b>Grand</b> <b>Old</b> Party), is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, the other being its historic rival, the Democratic Party. The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex Whigs and ex Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern states for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.|$|E

The historic city center (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the <b>Old</b> <b>Grand</b> Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the <b>Old</b> <b>Grand</b> Canal with the Slender West Lake; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the Lotus Flower Pond (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the <b>Old</b> <b>Grand</b> Canal.

He was a candidate in protest against the repression of the Fasci Siciliani in many national electoral districts. His election was annulled by the Council of the Chamber. In the next elections in September 1895, he was elected again in two electoral colleges. He was assigned by lot to the district of Cesena, leaving the fifth district of Milan to Filippo Turati, the <b>grand</b> <b>old</b> man of the socialist, who was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies for the first time.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War Sedition {{laws were}} used {{against those who}} opposed {{conscription}} and war, in particular the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in Australia.

Miller was released after serving {{a few weeks of}} his sentence but was re-arrested in 1917 in Sydney at the age of 84 and sentenced to six months jail with hard labour at Long Bay Gaol on the charge of belonging to an unlawful association.

25|$|The {{future of}} the theatre organ is always fluid, but several {{organizations}} are active in preserving and promoting these <b>grand,</b> <b>old</b> instruments. Among these are the American Theatre Organ Society and numerous independent theatre organ clubs who exist to refurbish and reinstall theatre organs to their former glory. Similar work is being done in the UK by the Cinema Organ Society and the Theatre Organ Club; in Australia the various divisions of TOSA have saved many theatre organs once in cinemas and theatres. Many of these rebuilt instruments have been installed in restaurants and auditoriums, {{as well as in}} a few theatres and churches, allowing the public to gain access to them.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, Dunedin was {{no longer}} the country's biggest city. Influence and {{activity}} moved north to the other centres ("the drift north"), a trend which continued for much of the following century. Despite this, the university continued to expand, and a student quarter became established. At the same time people started to notice Dunedin's mellowing, the ageing of its <b>grand</b> <b>old</b> buildings, with writers like E.H. McCormick pointing out its atmospheric charm. In the 1930s and early 1940s a new generation of artists such as M.T. (Toss) Woollaston, Doris Lusk, Anne Hamblett, Colin McCahon and Patrick Hayman once again represented the best of the country's talent. The Second World War saw the dispersal of these painters, but not before McCahon had met a very youthful poet, James K. Baxter, in a central city studio.|$|E
25|$|Springfield– {{like many}} {{mid-size}} Northeastern cities, e.g., Hartford, Albany, and New Haven– from the 1950s–1970s, razed {{a significant number}} of historic commercial buildings in the name of urban renewal. In 1961, this included Unity Church, the first building designed by the young Henry Hobson Richardson. Springfield's Metro Center remains more aesthetically cohesive than many its peer cities; however, as elsewhere, the city currently features a patchwork of parking-lots and <b>grand</b> <b>old</b> buildings. Current efforts are underway to improve the cohesion of Springfield's Metro Center, including the completed Main Street and State Street Corridor improvement projects, the upcoming $70million renovation to Springfield's 1926 Union Station and the renovation of the Epiphany Tower on State Street into a new hotel. New constructions include the architecturally award-winning, $57million Moshe Safdie-designed Federal Building on State Street.|$|E

25|$|At the Supreme War Council at the Trianon Palace Hotel, near Versailles (29 January - 2 February) Haig and Petain (French Commander-in-Chief) {{complained of}} {{shortage}} of troops. The BEF {{was facing a}} 100,000 manpower shortage by June 1918, whilst Petain talked of losing 25 divisions to natural wastage, but Haig’s political credibility was so low that Hankey wrote that they “made asses of themselves”. Haig argued against a common command, claiming {{that it would be}} “unconstitutional” for him to take orders from a foreign general. It was agreed that an Allied General Reserve be set up, under Foch with Henry Wilson as his deputy, but Haig argued {{that he did not have}} divisions to spare for this (worrying that they would be shipped off to fight the Turks but thinking the proposal would take time to be become operational) and suggested to the French Prime Minister Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch’s ambition to become generalissimo, and whom Haig thought “the soundest and pluckiest of the lot … a <b>grand</b> <b>old</b> man, full of go and determination”) that he might resign. Lord Milner thought Haig’s stance “desperately stupid”, although in Sheffield's view Haig had a point that control of reserves by a committee was not necessarily sensible. Clemenceau attacked Lloyd George’s wish to make offensives against Turkey top priority, and got Lloyd George to agree to delay offensives against the Turks for two months. Robertson openly opposed the Prime Minister; Haig did not speak in his defence, later writing that “LG never asked my opinion”. On the last day the conference discussed the General Reserve and extension of line. Again, Haig did not openly oppose the government’s plans, nor did he – at this stage – threaten to resign.|$|E
