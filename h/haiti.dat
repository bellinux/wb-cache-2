Upon arrival in <b>Haiti,</b> Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through <b>Haiti</b> as the first port of call by the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Haiti's</b> largest creditor, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), {{was part}} of the debt relief {{initiative}}, but the initiative only canceled loans made before 2005, and the IDB has lent more since. <b>Haiti's</b> debt to the IDB amounts to approximately half a billion dollars with debt service payments projected by the IMF to increase in the following years.
