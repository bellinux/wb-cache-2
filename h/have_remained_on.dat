5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} is reported to <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare {{to take to the}} lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. Brussels was taken by the Germans, and the radio was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E

5|$|Neville {{was the son}} of Ralph de Neville, a son of Alan de Neville, who {{was also}} Chief Forester. Hugh had a brother, Roger de Neville, who was part of Hugh's {{household}} from 1202 to 1213, when Roger was given custody of Rockingham Castle by King John. Another brother was William, who was given some of Hugh's lands in 1217. Hugh, Roger, and William were related to a number of other royal officials and churchmen, most notable among them Geoffrey de Neville, who was a royal chamberlain, and Ralph Neville, who became Bishop of Chichester. Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph's career, and the two appear to <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> good terms throughout the rest of Hugh's life.|$|E

5|$|As at the , the {{resident}} population was 360 {{people and the}} number of tourists was not allowed to exceed 400. Early settlers were European and American whalers and many of their offspring <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the island for more than six generations. Residents are now involved with the kentia palm industry, tourism, retail, some fishing and farming. In 1876 it was observed that on Sundays although there was a suspension of games and labour, there were no religious services. Nowadays, in an area known locally as Church Paddock, there are Anglican, Catholic and Adventist churches, the religious affiliations on the island being 30% Anglican, 22% no religion, 18% Catholic and 12% Seventh Day Adventist. There is about an equal division of the sexes with 47% of the population in the age group 25–54 and 92% holding Australian citizenship.|$|E

25|$|The {{first group}} of Hakka in Bangka and Belitung reached the islands in the 18th century from Guangdong. Many of them worked as tin mining labourers. Since then, they <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the island along with the native Malay. Their {{situation}} was much {{different from those of}} Chinese and native populations of other regions, where legal cultural conflicts were prevalent since the 1960s until 1999, by which Indonesian Chinese had finally regained their cultural freedoms. Here they lived together peacefully and still practiced their customs and cultural festivals, while in other regions they were strictly banned by government legislation prior to 1999. Hakka on the island of Bangka spoke Hopo dialect mixed with Malay, especially in younger generations. Hakka spoken in Belinyu area in Bangka is considered to be standard.|$|E
25|$|Off the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe {{was losing}} money {{on both the}} Islanders and the Nets even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL {{prominence}} and the Nets became an American Basketball Association power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10million they had paid in startup costs, and the expenses associated with moving the Nets to the National Basketball Association threw Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale {{to one of the}} team's limited partners, John Pickett, who assigned Torrey as team president. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative cable contract with the fledgling SportsChannel network as their owner, Charles Dolan, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended to not only keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the network, now known as MSG Plus, for over a quarter-century.|$|E
500|$|Bax's tone {{poems are}} {{in a variety of}} styles and have varied sharply in their popularity. His impressionistic tone poem In the Faëry Hills is {{described}} by Grove as [...] "a succinct and attractive piece". It was modestly successful, but Spring Fire (1913) is instanced by Foreman as a difficult work; it was not performed in Bax's lifetime. During the First World War Bax wrote three tone poems, two of which – The Garden of Fand (1913–16) and November Woods (1917) – <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the fringes of the modern repertoire, and a third – Tintagel (1917–19) – which in the decade after his death was the only work by which Bax was known to the public. Grove characterises all three as musical evocations of nature, with little expression of subjective personal response. The orchestral piece that was neglected longest was In memoriam (1917), a lament for Patrick Pearse, who was shot for his part in the Easter rising; the work was not played until 1998. Bax reused the main melody for his incidental music to Oliver Twist (1948).|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{especially}} {{pleased with the}} emotional experience of playing the game, particularly with other players. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer {{described it as a}} [...] "non-denominational religious experience" [...] that, with the addition of another player, moves beyond metaphors and becomes a [...] "pilgrimage" [...] to the player. A reviewer writing for Edge magazine said the emotional arc of the game hits with [...] "occasionally startling power", while Patrick Shaw from Wired said the game made him feel a [...] "wide range of emotions... wonder, fear, even sadness". Miller said all three times he played the game, [...] "each time, without fail, individual moments... managed to give me goosebumps, and those moments <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> my mind for weeks afterward". Joel Gregory of PlayStation Official Magazine praised the game's story for being open to the player's interpretation, leaving an ambiguity that drew him in. The addition of an unnamed second player was described by Donlan as brilliant and as a [...] "master stroke", and Edge said it made for [...] "a more absorbing, more atmospheric experience".|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> good terms since the initial controversy.

The crew appeared to <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> land just long enough to take on fresh water; they also raised the Venetian and Papal banners, claiming the land for the King of England and recognising the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church. After this landing, Cabot spent some weeks [...] "discovering the coast," [...] with most [...] "discovered after turning back." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{claimed that}} in Tibet, she was taught an ancient, unknown {{language}} known as Senzar, and translated {{a number of}} ancient texts written in this language that were preserved by the monks of a monastery; she stated that she was, however, not permitted entry into the monastery itself. She also claimed that while in Tibet, Morya and Koot Hoomi helped her develop and control her psychic powers. Among the abilities that she ascribed to these [...] "Masters" [...] were clairvoyance, clairaudience, telepathy, {{the ability to control}} another's consciousness, to dematerialize and rematerialize physical objects, and to project their astral bodies, thus giving the appearance of being in two places at once. She claimed to <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> this spiritual retreat from late 1868 until late 1870. Blavatsky never claimed in print to have visited Lhasa, although this is a claim that would be made for her in various later sources, including the account provided by her sister.|$|E

In September 2004, news stories circulated regarding a trial separation – Evans at the time had a stall at Camden Market, where he was found selling furniture and paintings from his London and Los Angeles homes, commenting: [...] "I {{just want to get}} rid of it all, it's just a headache." [...] In 2005, it was confirmed that Evans and Piper would divorce, with Piper publicly stating that she would take no money from Evans.

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and to participate later in a press conference. Leimer revealed that his objective for the feature race was to execute a fast getaway off the line, {{but in spite of}} struggling which almost lost him a position to Coletti, he declared himself [...] "very happy" [...] as he had waited for some time to win another race in the GP2 Series. When asked if he was not worried about heavy overtaking and tyre management, he replied yes, [...] "but I was much quicker than them so I was not using my tyres that much. It’s not the perfect situation for the tyres, but I still managed to save them." [...] Coletti spoke of his happiness over the job performed by his team but felt he could have pushed harder earlier in the race due to the fear of wearing his tyres out and thus elected to not take the risk. He stated that he did not inform his team that he observed Leimer entering the pit lane on the same lap as him and now believed he could <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> track for one additional lap. Rossi revealed his apprehension about how his tyres would behave and was uncertain on how to push it. Nevertheless, he praised the effort his team put into the event and spoke of his happiness of finishing in third place.|$|E
