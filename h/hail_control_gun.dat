40|$|Research on the {{effectiveness}} of <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> laws is inconsistent. In part, the research reflects the heated ideological debate between those supporting <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> and those opposing it. Both sides of the issue have published articles citing that either <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> does in fact reduce violence or <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> does not reduce violence. A major problem for those in support of <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> is proving the efficacy of <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> laws. These laws are extremely difficult to evaluate. First of all, the nature of law impedes implementing a controlled experiment in which random cities are assigned to pass specific laws and "control " cities are required to have no <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> laws (which would involve overturning existing laws). In addition, laws generally are very difficult to evaluate due to differential enforcement practices in different districts and states. Evaluation research has demonstrated that most <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> laws are poorly enforced due primarily to a lack of resources and the inability of law officials to meet the new legal requirements without an expanded institutional capacity. Further complications for evaluating <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> laws include controlling for outside contamination from other nearby cities. For instance, if Denver passed a strict <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> law {{there is no way to}} keep guns from nearby cities from filtering in and, therefore, an inability of knowing what kind of effect those gun...|$|R
