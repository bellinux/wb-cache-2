5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
25|$|The Paris gun {{emplacement}} was dug out of {{the north}} side of the wooded hill at Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique. The gun was mounted on <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> rails embedded in concrete, facing Paris.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} North Carolina owns the North Carolina Railroad Company, {{which owns the}} land and the bridge. (North Carolina Railroad owns no rolling stock, but leases tracks to Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Railway.) A <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> crash beam protects the bridge from over-height trucks, but does nothing to prevent crashes or protect the trucks. The crash beam has been hit so often that it has had to be {{replaced}} at least once.|$|E
5000|$|Armor-Piercing, M1922 (1922-1934): This was a {{redesigned}} armor-piercing {{round with}} a <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> core. It {{was the first}} Armor-Piercing round to have a black-painted bullet tip.|$|R
5000|$|Ingalls and Stevens {{completely}} {{rebuilt the}} C&O to [...] "modern" [...] standards with ballasted roadbed, enlarged and lined tunnels, <b>steel</b> bridges, and <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> rails, {{as well as}} new, larger, cars and locomotives.|$|R
50|$|A {{frequent}} brake van visitor was the ex-LSWR bogie brake van, {{which still}} had faint LSWR lettering showing under the BR red oxide wood paint. This {{tended to be}} used on <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> trains hauled by the double headed 03 shunters.|$|R
25|$|In 1872 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{began to}} prepare new defenses. Between 1873 and 1875, four 15-inch Rodman guns and a {{magazine}} were partially constructed. Work ceased in 1875 when money {{was no longer}} available. In 1887, President Cleveland found a treasury surplus. Two years earlier, a Board of Engineers, presided over by Secretary of War William C. Endicott, recommended {{a new system of}} seacoast defense that employed <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> breech-loading rifled guns, large mortars, rapid fire guns and underwater mines. The entire plan called for the installation of the new defenses at 27 sites along our coast and rivers.|$|E
25|$|Commissioned by {{impresario}} Richard D'Oyly Carte in {{the late}} 1880s, it was designed by Thomas Edward Collcutt. Carte intended {{it to be the}} home of English grand opera, much as his Savoy Theatre had been built as a home for English light opera, beginning with the Gilbert and Sullivan series. The foundation stone, laid by his wife Helen in 1888, can still be seen on the façade of the theatre, almost at ground level {{to the right of the}} entrance. The theatre's design was considered to be novel. The upper levels are supported by <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> cantilevers built into the back walls, removing the need for supporting pillars that impede the view of the stage. The tiers, corridors, staircases, landings are all constructed of concrete to reduce the risk and damage that might be done by fire.|$|E
25|$|The MacAdam shield-shovel {{resembled the}} {{standard}} portable infantry spade of its day in both size and shape. In {{order to stop}} or deflect enemy fire, thicker steel {{was used in the}} construction of the blade; it measured at three-sixteenths of an inch thick. <b>Heavy</b> <b>steel</b> was also used to make the shovel's detachable handle which measured four feet in length. Unique to the shield-shovel was the inclusion of a 3.5 by 2 inch sight-hole in the blade. The shovel was intended to be used as a shield by folding the handle to ~90° toward the concave side of the blade, exposing the spike that ran along the handle opposite the blade. The spike would then be driven into the ground, resulting in the blade standing vertically and the handle resting on the ground behind it as a brace.|$|E
50|$|And in contrast, older style wind {{turbines}} were designed with <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> blades, which have higher inertia, and rotated at speeds {{governed by the}} AC frequency of the power lines. The high inertia buffered the changes in rotation speed and thus made power output more stable.|$|R
5000|$|A second [...] "Quill" [...] was {{modified}} to the Milwaukee Road's specifications, {{and with more}} success. The entire series was effectively converted to single-end operation and were fitted with Commonwealth Delta idler trucks of better design than the originals to help guide the locomotives into curves. The frames were also completely rebuilt with <b>heavier</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium front subframe. Aluminium {{is used for}} the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of [...] V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> subframe.|$|R
25|$|The subway connects Honour Avenue with Appel Street, is {{approximately}} three metres wide and formed with reinforced concrete retaining walls, ceiling and floor slabs. The walls are lined from {{the concrete floor}} to approximately two metres with ceramic tiles, dark green bands {{at the top and}} bottom and white inside. A number of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> grille covers mark the drainage system. To the west, two ramps going in opposite directions take pedestrians to Honour Avenue. To the east there is one ramp. All are made with reinforced concrete retaining walls and slabs. Where the subway walls join the ramp walls the corners are rounded. There are uncovered drains made in each side of the concrete ramp slabs. Lining the tops of the ramp walls are some painted metal railings, the same as those around the stairway opening on the platform serving tracks 3 and 4.|$|E
25|$|Steel wolf traps, used {{frequently}} in the American west, were made from <b>heavy</b> <b>steel,</b> were {{six and a half}} inches wide, and had two springs, each with 100lbs of power. Steel wolf traps were usually the same models used in the capture of beavers, lynx and wolverine. In order to hide the human scent, trappers would handle their equipment with gloves, and cover the traps in beeswax or blood. As the wolf's power of scent is so great, a mere touch of human skin on the trap will result in the wolf vacating the area. Wolves may also dig up or spring the traps. The traps would typically be set in fours around a bait and strongly fastened to concealed logs, and covered in moss, chaff, cotton or sand for camouflage. Sometimes, the trap and the bait would be placed in a pool of water, thus leaving no other point of access for the wolf to take.|$|E
25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel,</b> and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|E
50|$|The {{complexity}} of mach 2 flight was realised during the 545 development. Vickers-Supermarine proposed the 553 with a swept wing {{that would make}} the plane more aerodynamic than a straight wing design. It would be produced of aluminium alloy. The decision was close to make the aircraft because {{it would have to be}} made from <b>heavier</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Gustav Lindenthal made bridges {{that reached}} new heights for his time. At {{the time of}} Hell Gate's completion, the bridge stood as the longest and <b>heaviest</b> <b>steel</b> bridge in the world. Gustav Lindenthal also {{expanded}} the idea of [...] "double decker" [...] lanes on his bridges. The Queensboro Bridge {{is one of the}} bridges Lindenthal designed that displays the double decker idea.|$|R
25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' to the {{telephone}} operator at the loading station, who, in turn, reported to the 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely about when the craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off at the same instant, and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain need to get the LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E
500|$|World War I and the Prohibition impelled local {{lawmakers to}} {{initiate}} a crackdown on Butte's red light district; by 1917, the district was effectively closed. Signs saying [...] "Men Under 21 Keep Out" [...] were commonplace, {{and in the next}} census, prostitution had completely disappeared as a declared profession in Butte. The Dumas, however, remained in operation. In 1925 Anne Vallet began overseeing the Dumas for the Nadeau family, and in the 1930s, operations had passed to Madam Rose Davis. In 1940 Lillian Walden and her husband Dick began running the brothel, raising the price of sex at the brothel to $2. Three years later, the US government ordered all brothels shut down {{to prevent the spread of}} venereal diseases among soldiers in World War II. In response, the Dumas began operating even more furtively, now under the guise of being a boardinghouse. The [...] "window-shopping" [...] was abandoned completely and a <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> door was installed at the back of the Dumas with a small sliding window; customers would only gain entrance after the sliding window was opened and their identity was acknowledged. Additionally, doorbells were added and a code system for dealing with troublesome guests was also employed.|$|E
500|$|After bomber {{production}} {{ended in}} 1940, the Z model was modified with a [...] "solid" [...] nose from the Ju 88C, fitted with one 20mm MG FF cannon and three 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns, {{to be used}} as night fighters. Three prototypes were converted from existing Z-series airframes to the Do 17 Z-7 Kauz I ("screech-owl") configuration. The standard Z-7 was fitted with Bramo 323P-1 radial engines and had a crew of three airmen. In comparison to the standard bomber version, the fuel load arrangement was altered by subdividing into cells. Two cells were in the wings, with a capacity of 770 litres (154 imperial gallons) each. A third cell was placed in the bomb bay within the main fuselage, having a capacity of 895 litres (179 imperial gallons). The oxygen supply for the three man crew was reduced to nine bottles, as intercepts at high altitudes were not anticipated. Add-on armour in the form of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> plates was bolted to the nose bulkhead to protect the crew against frontal fire. Originally, it was planned to completely armour the crew compartment. This idea, was given up again as the increased weight would have reduced flight performance of an already slow aircraft. The ammunition loads for the three 7.92mm MG 17s amounted to 3,000 rounds and 400 rounds of ammunition for the 20mm MG 151 cannon (although some Do 17Z bombers carried a single 20mm for ground attack missions).|$|E
50|$|In 1977, the UO-10 was introduced, {{followed}} {{the next year}} by a slightly heavier road model, the UO-9. The UO-10 was largely {{the same as the}} UO-8 but with aluminum alloy cotterless crankset and aluminum alloy rims. The UO-9 was essentially the same as the UO-10 but had cheaper and <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> rims. In 1980, the PH-8 displaced the UO-8 as the entry-level Peugeot road bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Steam locomotives, {{never before}} tried {{on a narrow}} gauge line and {{declared}} by all the leading designers to be unworkable on so narrow a gauge, were inevitable. But {{they would not have}} been possible when the line was built in 1836 and could only be introduced 27 years later when locomotive development had advanced and after the line had been relaid with <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> rails.|$|R
50|$|The {{deck of a}} {{rotary mower}} is {{typically}} made of steel. Lighter steel is used on less expensive models, and <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> on more expensive models for durability. Other deck materials include aluminium, which does not rust and is a staple of higher priced mowers, and hard composite plastic, which does not rust and is lighter and less expensive than aluminium. Electric mowers typically have a plastic deck.|$|R
500|$|The {{authors of}} Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion {{consider}} the heavily decorated late 17th-century ceilings {{of the house}} to be [...] "the finest single architectural legacy among the country houses of the region". As in Plas Taliaris and several other country houses in the county, the ceilings are panelled, with [...] "thick moulded beams and wreaths in the panels and winged cherubs' heads in the corners". The entrance hall contains a columned Doric screen with a 19th-century ribbed and bossed ceiling. The old dining room to the right of this features a coffered ceiling dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including guilloché, acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned coffered ceiling with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with bay leaf design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of the handrail. [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896. A strongroom with [...] walls and <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> fire-proof doors was added in 1914, for the Dynevors to keep their important documents and valuables. On the upper floors are rooms with 18th-century fittings, including [...] "panelled dados, lugged architraves, low relief plaster ceilings and closets within angled turrets". The bedroom on the northeast of the house features a particularly detailed coffered ceiling with floral patterns.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{development}} of construction and design technology gives larger and <b>heavier</b> <b>steel</b> structures. In addition, reductions of construction and maintenance cost are also recently focused in various fields. From this viewpoint, higher strength, better weldability and higher performance {{are required for}} structural steels. In order to achieve these requirements, advanced and sophisticated process technology is critical in addition to precise material design. This paper describes the {{development of}} the Super-OLAC (On Line Accelerated Cooling) and its various products...|$|R
2500|$|Harley-Davidson FL [...] "big twins" [...] {{normally}} had <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> fenders, chrome trim, {{and other}} ornate and heavy accessories. After World War II, riders wanting more speed would often shorten the fenders or {{take them off}} completely to reduce {{the weight of the}} motorcycle. These bikes were called [...] "bobbers" [...] or sometimes [...] "choppers" [...] because parts considered unnecessary were chopped off. Those who made or rode choppers and bobbers, especially members of outlaw bike gangs like the Hells Angels, referred to stock FLs as [...] "garbage wagons".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] it {{was stated}} the {{regenerative}} cycle creates {{a large amount}} of residual regeneration energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body. As demonstrated by the Tenth Doctor {{for the first time in}} that story, in the first fifteen hours of regeneration this energy is enough to even rapidly regrow a severed hand. This is in keeping with earlier serials, such as Robot, where the newly regenerated Fourth Doctor splits a brick with his bare hand, and in the 1996 television movie, where the Doctor is depicted battering down a <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> door in a hospital morgue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interurban}} cars varied {{considerably in}} age and design. [...] A number of pre-1910 very large arch-windowed wooden combines that had survived in service on ISC and THI were disposed of {{within the first}} couple of years of IR's existence, leaving a fleet made up predominantly of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> single-ended combines. There were about half a dozen 400 class ISC combines, 30 UTC steel combines (including 15 modern cars only five years old), and nine of Interstate IPS's handsome heavyweight combines, parlor and sleeping cars. A few of these former Interstate cars were still operated by a British Columbia railroad in the 1990s. (Classic Trains Magazine, Sept 2008.) ...|$|E
