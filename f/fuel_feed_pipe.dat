5000|$|THTR-300 {{was only}} in full service for 423 days. On May 4, 1986, just 6 months after it had been {{connected}} to the power grid, a fuel pebble became lodged in a <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> to the reactor core. Consequently, some radioactive dust was released to the environment. This happened {{just a couple of}} days after the Chernobyl disaster. The operators played down the incident, which caused a loss of confidence in the regulatory authorities. The Westphalia ministry of commerce created a fact finding committee. After a couple of weeks the power plant was switched on again, but the former supporters withdrew their backing. The reactor kept experiencing technical difficulties, with fuel elements breaking more often than anticipated. The fuel factory in Hanau was decommissioned for security reasons. The fuel supply had already been difficult before this decision, and now it was truly at risk. It was decided to shut down THTR-300. 80 incidents were logged in its short lifetime.From 1985 to 1989, the THTR-300 registered 16410 operation hours and generated 2891000 MWh, according to a full-load working time of 423 days.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{data about}} the dynamic {{behaviour}} of pulverized coal and biomass–coal blends in fuel injection pipelines allow power plant operators to detect variations in fuel supply and oscillations in the flow at an early stage, enable them to balance fuel distribution between <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>pipes</b> and ultimately to achieve higher combustion efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Electrostatic sensor arrays and data fusion algorithms are combined to provide a non-intrusive solution to the measurement of fuel particle velocity, relative solid concentration and flow stability under pneumatic conveying conditions. Electrostatic sensor arrays with circular and arc-shaped electrodes are integrated in the same sensing head to measure 'averaged' and 'localized' characteristics of pulverized fuel flow. Data fusion techniques are applied to optimize and integrate {{the results from the}} sensor arrays. Experimental tests were conducted on the horizontal section of a 150 mm bore pneumatic conveyor circulating pulverized coal and sawdust under various flow conditions. Test results suggest that pure coal particles travel faster and carry more electrostatic charge than biomass–coal blends. As more biomass particles are added to the flow, the overall velocity of the flow reduces, the electrostatic charge level on particles decreases and the flow becomes less stable compared to the pure coal flow...|$|R
5000|$|On 29 May 1962, Cliona was {{participating}} in an annual exercise south of Roches Point. The Cliona had a press party including {{a number of}} RTÉ cameras embarked to do some filming for the new national broadcaster. The ship initially carried out a successful Hedgehog mortar exercise. During her second pattern of depth charges, she suffered a premature explosion from a charge dropped from the port stern rail. The resulting explosion lifted {{the stern of the}} ship {{out of the water and}} the concussion ruptured <b>fuel</b> oil <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> in the after boiler room. The leaking oil resulted in a serious fire which rapidly accelerated out of control. Stoker William Mynes closed the feed valves, isolating the supply of fuel to the fire. Mynes had to be ordered to leave his post so he could receive medical attention for burns he had sustained in the fire fighting effort. The Executive Officer, Lt. Pat O'Mahoney, then entered the aft boiler room where he fought the fire for at least another thirty minutes. The fire was eventually extinguished, despite the Marine Rescue Coordination centre dispatching an oceangoing tug, the Clonmel to the scene to assist, the Cliona [...] was able to proceed to Haulbowline under her own steam for an investigation and repairs. Neither Mynes or O'Mahoney received a decoration for the bravery they showed in their fire fighting effort.|$|R
40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how the feed flow from such a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). The feed flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements were performed with different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of the feed flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate the feed flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> average values of several parameters characterising the feed flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> are the same for different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the impeller speed is high, the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of the feed flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> opening and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

40|$|Experiments on semibatch {{reaction}} crystallization of {{benzoic acid}} are reported. The conditions in an agitated tank are simulated by a loop reactor by which feed point mixing conditions {{can be controlled}} separately from the macroscale circulation rate. Hydrochloric acid is fed into a circulating solution of sodium benzoate and the in#uence of macromixing, mesomixing and micromixing on the product crystal mean size is evaluated. The product mean size increases with increasing circulation rate in the loop, with increasing feed point mixing intensity, with decreasing feed rate and with decreasing <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter. Increased mixing intensity on any level leads to larger product crystals, but especially the rate of mesomixing is of importance. The in#uence of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is opposite to predictions by available theories and cannot be explained by backmixing into the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe.</b> All results can be correlated quite well against a dimensionless mixing e$ciency de"ned as {{the ratio of the}} reactant feeding time to the mixing time.

40|$|The {{demand for}} seafood is {{continuously}} growing throughout the world, {{while the number}} of sheltered locations for fish farming is decreasing. Consequently, the industry is pushed to fin nd new and innovative solutions to this problem. One solution is to move the fish farms in non-sheltered locations, which requires extensive research on all structural parts of a fish farm, including components of the feeding system. The main goal of this thesis is to predict the hydrodynamic loads on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> used by fish farmers in the industry, which is an important aspect of design to assure successful operation. The aquaculture industry has expressed the need for increasing the knowledge on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> for fish farming. The bending of the pipes is of particular concern, especially when introducing non-sheltered locations. The hydrodynamic loads of the feed barge were obtained by generating a finite element model in GeniE and performing hydrodynamic analysis in frequency domain with the potential solver Wadam. The displacement RAOs of the feed barge were imported into OrcaFlex after conducting a sensitivity-and convergence study to verify the results. Dynamic simulations of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> were carried out in time domain using OrcaFlex, where the design basis was established using typical environmental and design data for Norwegian salmon farming. Analyses were performed under different sea states, investigating different responses of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Due to the limited work available on the force coefficients for floating pipes on the sea surface, a sensitivity study regarding the force coefficients was carried out. It was concluded to implement a variable data set for the drag-and added mass coe cient of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes.</b> The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in high loads for all <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths. The main problem that was found for the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> was the large bending moment at the connection points, i. e. at the fish cage and the feed barge. For this reason, bend stiffeners at the connection points were installed. A reduction of 846 % for the bending moment was observed with the bending stiffener attached to the pipe. To conclude, the dynamic analysis exhibits too large hydrodynamic loads for offshore use. The use of bending stiffeners seems inevitable for the harsh environment in the open sea. More research on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> must be carried out to secure safe operation offshore...|$|R

40|$|Perturbations in {{the rate}} of fuel flow from the {{injector}} into the combustor can directly affect unsteady motions in the combustor. Therefore, understanding the dynamic characteristics of the injector is important in the effort to control these phenomena.

The magnitude of the specific acoustic impedance with respect to frequencies was varied by the static pressure in the fuel tubing. A normalized fuel transfer function between mass flow rate and acoustic pressure fluctuations was obtained in the frequency range between 10 and 200 Hz. Its gain shows a tendency to increase with frequency. The phase of the normalized fuel flow rate fluctuation at the injector exit was also measured.

40|$|The {{abundant}} {{availability of}} biomass solid wastes in Malaysia such as palm shells {{from the oil}} palm industry promotes diversified research fields for its utilization. This paper investigates {{the application of a}} cascading hearth staged combustor to palm shells combustion in terms of <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> rate effect on temperature profiles. The application of a two-step hearth setup at primary stage combustion offers wider alternatives for solid phase combustion processes. Initial combustion studies of palm shells by controlled air combustion conditions using these set-ups show promising results for further development.

Varying the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> at 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 kg/min with constant air supply of 227 liters/min (8 CFM) and good fuel distribution on the hearth leads to fuel core temperatures exceeding 1000 oC.
