40|$|ABSTRACT. Seismic {{processing}} aims {{to provide}} an adequate image of the subsurface geology. During seismic processing, the filtering of signals considered noise is of utmost importance. Among these signals is the surface rolling noise, better known as <b>ground-roll.</b> <b>Ground-roll</b> occurs mainly in land seismic data, masking reflections, and this roll has the following main features: high amplitude, low frequency and low speed. The attenuation of this noise is generally performed through so-called conventional methods using 1 -D or 2 -D frequency filters in the fk domain. This study uses the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method for <b>ground-roll</b> attenuation. The EMD method was implemented in the programming language FORTRAN 90 and applied in the time and frequency domains. The application of this method to the processing of land seismic line 204 -RL- 247 in Tacutu Basin resulted in stacked seismic sections that were of similar or sometimes better quality compared with those obtained using the fk and high-pass filtering methods...|$|E
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 343 - 353 We {{present a}} new {{filtering}} method for the attenuation of <b>ground-roll.</b> The method {{is based on}} the application of a bi-dimensional filter for obtaining the time-derivative of the seismograms. Before convolving the filter with the input data matrix, the normal moveout correction is applied to the seismograms with the purpose of flattening the reflections. The method can locally attenuate the amplitude of data of low frequency (in the <b>ground-roll</b> and stretch normal moveout region) and enhance flat events (reflections). The filtered seismograms can reveal horizontal or sub-horizontal reflections while vertical or sub-vertical events, associated with <b>ground-roll,</b> are attenuated. A regular set of samples around each neighbourhood data sample of the seismogram is used to estimate the time-derivative. A numerical approximation of the derivative is computed by taking the difference between the interpolated values calculated in both the positive and the negative neighbourhood of the desired position. The coefficients of the 2 D time-derivative filter are obtained by taking the difference between two filters that interpolate at positive and negative times. Numerical results that use real seismic data show that the proposed method is effective and can reveal reflections masked by the <b>ground-roll.</b> Another benefit of the method is that the stretch mute, normally applied after the normal moveout correction, is unnecessary. The new filtering approach provides results of outstanding quality when compared to results obtained from the conventional FK filtering method...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Onshore seismic data {{often have}} low {{signal to noise}} ratio due to, among other factors, the {{presence}} of <b>ground-roll,</b> a noise characterized by coherent, linear and dispersive events with high amplitudes, low frequencies and velocities. This noise overlaps with reflections, hindering the data processing and interpretation. When the attempts to reduce the <b>ground-roll</b> during data acquisition (using source and receiver arrays) fail, several methods can be used in seismic processing. Here we discuss a filtering method based on Wiener shaping filter, its implementation and its main parameters. We also present a different approach based on the direct deconvolution algorithm. The results of the application of direct methods to a real seismic data set are quite satisfactory when compared with those obtained with conventional FK and low-cut filters...|$|E

40|$|Coherent noise or {{surface waves}} {{filtering}} {{represents one of}} the most complex issues in land seismic data processing. Wavelet based filtering has recently begun to challenge the popular and robust frequencywavenumber (�- �- �) filter. Wavelet filters provide fine time-scale representations and non linear filtering capabilities that yield in some instances better results on dispersive coherence noise. We propose in this work an improvement over the classical discrete wavelets filtering via the use of shift-invariant wavelets. Though relatively computationally expensive, their theoretical framework enables a closer approximation to the continuous wavelets, which results in finer filtering, less subject to aliasing and to wavelet ringing artifacts. Results are demonstrated on real seismic data sets. Improvements on <b>ground-roll</b> filtering show shift-invariant wavelets to be promising denoising techniques...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the application of}} seismic interferometry to surface waves. Seismic interferometry is {{the process by which}} the wavefield between two recording locations is estimated, resulting in new recordings at one location as if a source had been placed at the other. Thus, in surface-wave interferometry, surface waves propagating between two receiver locations are estimated as if one receiver had recorded the response due to a source of surface-wave energy at the other receiver. In global and engineering seismology new surface-wave responses can allow for imaging of the subsurface, and in exploration seismology it has been proposed that these new surface-wave responses can allow for the prediction and removal of socalled <b>ground-roll</b> (surface waves that are treated as noise). This thesis presents a detailed analysis of surface-wave interferometry: using a combination of modelling studies, real-data studies, and theoretical analyses the processes involved in the application of interferometry to complex (both multi-mode and scattered) surface waves are revealed. These analyses identify why surface waves are often dominant in the application of interferometry, where errors may be introduced in the application of surface-wave interferometry, and how interferometry may be processed {{in such a way as}} to minimise those (and other) errors. This allows for the proposal of new data-processing strategies in the application of seismic interferometry to surface waves, potentially resulting in improved surface-wave estimates. Much of the work in this thesis focuses on the use of seismic interferometry to predict and subtract surface waves in land-seismic exploration surveys. Using insights from the presented analyses it is shown that seismic surface waves can be successfully predicted and removed from land-seismic data using an interferometric approach. However, the work in this thesis is not only limited to applications in exploration seismology. In addition to the <b>ground-roll</b> removal method, improved estimates of higher-mode and scattered surfaces waves may allow for more advanced imaging algorithms to be used in conjunction with seismic interferometry. Also, as a consequence of the analysis presented a Generalized Optical Theorem for Surface Waves is derived. This highlights a link between seismic interferometry and the optical theorem and may allow for further application of optical theorems in seismology.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{singular}} value decomposition (SVD) filtering method for atten-uation {{of the ground}} roll. Before the SVD computation, normal move-out (NMO) correction {{is applied to the}} seismograms, with the purpose of flatten-ing the reflections. SVD is performed on a small number of traces in a sliding window. The output trace is the central trace of the first few eigenimages. These contains mostly horizontally aligned signals, and other noise in the data will be suppressed. By performing this action with the sliding window moving in steps of one trace, the number of output traces is equal to the number of input traces. The new method preserves the character and frequency content of the horizontal reflections and attenuates all other type of events. We il-lustrate the method using land seismic data of the Tacutu basin, located in the north-east part of Brazil. The results show that the proposed method is effective and is able to reveal reflections masked by the <b>ground-roll.</b> The new SVD filtering approach provides results of better quality, when compared with results obtained from the conventional f-k filtering method. ...|$|E
40|$|The Prediction Error Filter (PEF) is {{a widely}} used tool in various {{geophysical}} applications such as signal-noise separation and interpolation of missing data.

40|$|Locating oil {{reservoirs}} {{that are}} economically viable {{is one of}} the main problems in the petroleum industry. This task is primarily undertaken through seismic exploration, where explosive sources generate seismic waves whose reflections at the different geological layers are recorded at the ground or sea level by acoustic sensors (geophones or hydrophones). Source–generated noise, such as air, refracted, guided waves, near–surface multiples, and ground roll, represents a serious problem in seismic data processing, since noisy data can lead to wrong geological inferences. A noise of particular concern is the ground roll, which is the main type of coherent noise in land seismic surveys and is commonly much stronger in amplitude than the reflected signals. Standard methods for suppressing ground roll include one-dimensional high–pass filtering and two-dimensional f–k filtering [1]. Such “global ” filters are based on the elimination of specific frequencies and have the disad-vantage that they also affect the uncontaminated part of the signal. Recently, “local ” filters for suppressing the ground roll have been proposed using the Karhunen-Loève transform [2] and the wavelet transform [3]. Also an optmized method for suppressing the <b>ground-roll</b> noise from seismic data based on the Karhunen–Loève (KL) transform, was recently proposed [4].

40|$|The {{complexity}} of seismic data still challenges signal processing algorithms in several applications. The re-discovery of wavelet transforms by J. Morlet et al. has allowed improvements in addressing several data rep-resentation (local analysis, compression) and restoration problems. However, despites their achievements, traditional approaches based on discrete and separable (both for computational purposes) wavelets fail at efficiently representing directional or higher dimensional data features, such as line or plane singularities, especially in severe noise conditions. Subsequent extensions to wavelets (multiscale pyramids, curvelets [YaTrHe 04][Do 06], contourlets, bandlets) have recently generated tremendous {{theoretical and practical}} in-terests. They feature local and multiscale properties associated {{with a certain amount}} of redundancy, which may represent an issue for huge datasets processing. We propose here seismic data processing based on dual-tree M-band wavelet transforms [ChDuPe 06]. They combine: • orthogonal M-band filter banks which better separate frequency bands in seismic data than wavelets, due to the increased degrees of freedom in the filter design, • Hilbert transform and complex representation of seismic signals which have been effective, especially for attributes definition, with a relatively low redundancy (a factor of two). These transforms have been successfully applied to random noise removal in traditional and remote sensing imagery. We apply them to seismic data and address their potential for local slope analysis and coherent noise (<b>ground-roll)</b> filtering...|$|E
40|$|Known {{problems}} with vibroseis data include difficult-to-pick and inaccurate first-arrival times, poor well ties, correlation side lobes, harmonic ghosts, and coupling differences. Also, to reduce acquisition costs, various methods {{are used to}} record and then separate data from different source locations using vibrators sweeping si-multaneously, but these methods suffer from poor data separation and harmonic contamination. A novel com-bination of heritage Mobil High Fidelity Vibratory Seis-mic (HFVS) and heritage Exxon vibrator technologies solves these {{problems with}} vibroseis data. The method involves vibrator separation combined with vibrator sig-nature deconvolution {{in such a manner}} that the output is minimum phase and matches impulsive data. Vibrator signatures are calculated from the vibrator accelerome-ter measurements. The signatures from multiple vibra-tors and multiple sweeps are used to design a filter that optimally separates the data from each vibrator and re-places the signatures with a specially designed impulse response. Specific procedures are included to reduce the effects of inversion noise, which can distort the phase. HFVS recording can be used to increase production rates and reduce acquisition costs or to increase spatial sampling and improve data quality. Data recorded from multiple vibrators sweeping simultaneously can be sep-arated by at least 60 dB. After separation, the data from each vibrator can be processed as unique source points. Compared with traditional vibrator arrays, individually processing each source point can result in better data quality by reducing intra-array effects and improving the mitigation of <b>ground-roll</b> noise...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} elastic Chebyshev spectral element method (SPEM) is used {{to model}} the seismic wavefield within a massive structure and in its vicinity. We consider 2 -D models where a linear elastic structure, with quadrangular cross-section, resting on an elastic homogeneous half-space, is impinged upon by the waves generated by a surface impulse at some distance. The scattering of Rayleigh waves and {{the response of the}} structure are extensively analysed in a parametric way, varying size, mechanical parameters and shape of the load. Some of the models considered are representative of embankments and earth dams. The simulation shows that some models resonate, storing part of the incoming energy. With realistic parameters, the lowest resonance frequency is due to pure shear deformation and is controlled by the shear velocity and height of the load. Flexural modes are excited only at higher frequencies. The acceleration {{at the top of the}} structure may be five/seven times higher than at the base, depending on the mass of the structure. The gradual release of trapped energy produces a ground roll lasting several seconds after the wave front has passed. The <b>ground-roll</b> amplitude depends on the sturcture's mass and can be as large as 30 % of the peak acceleration. Outside resonance conditions, the ground motion is almost unaffected by the presence of the artefact; the horizontal motion on top of it is nearly twice the motion at ground level. Similar results should be expected when the incident field is an upcoming shear wave. A qualitative discussion shows that the presence of anelastic attenuation in the embankment does not significantly alter the preceding conclusions, unless it is of very low values (e. g. Q < 15). The modelling results that we discuss indicate that the soil-structure interaction may substantially alter the 'free-field' ground motion. From a practical point of view, the main conclusions are: (1) careful analysis is necessary when interpreting seismic records collected in the vicinity of large artefacts; (2) seismic hazard at a site may depend on the presence of man-made structures such as embankments, dams, tall and massive buildings...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} multicomponent seismic exploration, the wavefield {{is recorded}} by measuring translational motions in three directions using three-component sensors. A novel approach in land seismic acquisition is to additionally record the rotational {{components of the}} wavefield around the various Cartesian axes and to combine them with translational measurements. Additional rotational measurements provide the opportunity to locally extract valuable information on the propagating wavefield, that either cannot be obtained from conventional translational measurements alone or are challenging to extract. For example, rotational data facilitate wavefield separation, shear-wave (S-wave) imaging, and ground roll suppression because of the direct link between rotation and the S-wave component, but also enable local instantaneous phase velocity estimation. At the Earth’s free surface, rotational motions can be {{expressed in terms of}} spatial seismic wavefield gradients. Wavefield gradients can be estimated by differencing the outputs of closely spaced three-component translational sensors. The same approach can be adapted to source arrays: differencing of recordings from closely spaced translational (directed) sources can be used to simulate rotational sources that primarily emit S-waves. The combination of three components of translation and three components of rotation on both the source and the receiver side leads to a total of 36 measurable seismic components. In this thesis, I first verify that array-derived rotational rates, estimated using spatial seismic wavefield gradients, correspond to direct rotation measurements from rotational sensors. Then, I investigate the value of 36 -component seismic data using synthetic as well as real field data. I show that rotational components around the vertical axis mainly contain horizontally polarized S-waves. I found that rotational components around the crossline (transverse horizontal) axis mainly contain <b>ground-roll</b> and vertically polarized S-waves and that these data can be combined with translational data to suppress ground roll. I show that the amplitudes of rotational components are dependent on the angle of incidence of the wavefield and that source-sided rotational components are reciprocal to receiver-sided rotational components. To accelerate multicomponent acquisition, I furthermore present a new multicomponent seismic vector-source, which uses the Galperin configuration to obtain orthogonal vector sources of equal impact patterns and constant source-coupling. This source allows a fast multicomponent dataacquisition in engineering and environmental exploration seismology. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesGeoscience and EngineeringIDE...|$|E
40|$|In seismic {{reflection}} land data, <b>Ground-Roll</b> (GR) {{constitutes an}} high amplitude and low frequency noise that obliterates the reflected events decreasing {{the quality of}} the seimograms and, as a consequence, of the final stack section. Many processing methods are adopted to reduce the GR noise but the dispersive nature of the surface waves makes it difficult to design an optimal window for classical 1 D filtering approaches based on short time Fourier Transform or for 2 D approaches based on singular value decomposition. Also, 2 D methods such as the f-k filtering can generate artifacts or can give poor results if the surface waves are aliased or if the traces are not regularly spaced. An additional difficulty is that the characteristics of the surface waves change depending on the near surface properties so that their features can vary drastically along the seismic line. This, requires to adapt the parameters of the processing operators according to the changing characteristics of the GR. Actual and more sophisticated methods consist in the estimation of the surface waves followed by adaptive subtraction but they are computationally expensive and time consuming. Source and/or receiver array design still remains the less invasive approach to reduce the surface waves noise and, for near surface survey, Tognarelli and Stucchi (2016) proposed an acquisition scheme that permits to perform different array simulations in the processing lab. Arrays are not able to remove the GR, they are effective to partially reduce the GR and at improving the signal window. In the last years, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (Daubechies, 1990, 1992) has been used {{in a wide range of}} geophysical and geological disciplines such as seismic, oceanography, and climatology (Torrence and Compo, 1998, Lau and Weng, 1995, Deighan and Watts, 1997, Sinha et al., 2005, Farge, 1992, Sadowsky, 1996), but also in other contexts like image processing, music and medicine fields (Mallat, 2009). In general, the CWT analysis can be applied successfully to all time or spatial series that represent a non-stationary process, with the aim of investigating the spectral components and how they change over time and/or space. In this work, the CWT is used to analyse the shot gathers from a near surface seismic land survey and an intuitive filtering procedure, applied in the wavelet domain and aimed at attenuating the GR, is presented. The improvement of the data quality is shown and discussed for the shot gathers and finally for the stack section...|$|E

In this thesis, the Fitzroy Basin {{which is}} located within the Canning Basin in the northwest region of Western Australia (WA), was explored in regards to geological structure, stratigraphy and the probability {{of the presence of}} petroleum and gas. This involved processing and interpretation using geophysical methods such as 2 D seismic reflection. These methods were applied to the Yulleroo 2 D multi-channel seismic reflection data collected in 2007 and was supplemented by the Yulleroo- 1 and Yulleroo- 2 well logs. This data was kindly provided by the Geological Research Unit in the Department of Mining and Petroleum of Western Australia. In total, data acquisition was performed previously for about 373 km, made up of 13 individual seismic reflection lines, by Terrex Seismic in 2007. For this thesis, three of the seismic reflection lines in the Fitzroy Basin were chosen to be processed and interpreted. They were selected specifically for their proximity to the Yulleroo- 1 well, which was drilled in 1967, and the Yulleroo- 2 well which was drilled in 2008. The seismic data for these lines were collected using vibroseis as the source, with six second length and a 2 ms sample rate and thus had a Nyquest frequency of 250 Hz. Each station consisted of 400 channels with a 20 m gap to record seismic data. Thus, the near-offset between source and receiver was 10 m and the far-offset was 3990 m. For this seismic reflection data acquisition, a group interval of 20 m was used. The seismic reflection lines were processed using the Globe Claritas 6. 1. 1 software package on PC. Initially the SEGD formatted data was converted to the Claritas internal format before processing. This was followed by conventional seismic data processing including: noisy signal elimination; assignment of shot and receiver positions to the headers (geometry); phase conversion; static correction; gain recovery; suppression of <b>ground-roll</b> effects; deconvolution; filtering in the frequency domain; grouping common deep point (CDP); normal moveout (NMO) correction and velocity analysis; seismic stack; residual static correction; seismic migration, and automatic gain control (AGC). Seismic data was collected in the time domain. To be able to interpret in the depth domain, an attempt was made to convert the seismic reflection lines by considering both well logs and stratigraphic information. The seismic lines intersected the Fenton fault which has had a significant effect on the structure of the Canning Basin. Furthermore, the activity of this fault has also caused significant structural changes to the Yulleroo anticlinal via seismic activity.   The processed seismic reflection lines showed the Yulleroo anticlinal, Fenton fault and other small faults which current geologic structural maps do not currently show. As a further step, gas levels recorded in the well logs were used to aid location estimates on the seismic lines. In addition, instantaneous amplitude and frequency lines were produced from the seismic data to estimate potential hydrocarbon locations. In previous studies, the Fenton fault, which was found to be a listric fault, and the Yulleroo anticlinal were investigated in multiple seismic reflection sections. The interpretation in this thesis concentrated on the areas around this fault and the anticlinal. In particular, interpretation was performed on three seismic sections which corresponded with the three seismic lines. In the westernmost seismic reflection section, the Fenton fault was detected spanning the time interval from the surface to approximately 2500 ms. Within the same section, the Yulleroo anticlinal was also partially shown. The area of the anticlinal that was most eroded, which is thought to belong to the Jurassic age, was present until 600 ms within this seismic reflection section. It appeared that this eroded area was less deformed above the anticlinal. In the central seismic reflection section, the Fenton fault was detected at an estimated depth between 0 ms and 2400 ms. Within this seismic reflection section, in addition to the entire Yulleroo anticlinal being present, further minor previously unmapped faults were located and marked on the structural geology maps. In the easternmost seismic reflection section, the Fenton fault was also located and appeared to be present until an estimated depth of 2300 ms. The findings of this thesis were concentrated on the area corresponding to a depth estimated to be between 400 ms and 2100 ms. Within this section two novel major unmapped faults were described in further detail than previously with their position being indicated on geological structural maps of the area. The Yulleroo anticlinal, which is present in its entirety within the eastern seismic reflection section, was observed to have greater deformation than in the other seismic reflection sections. Within the Yulleroo anticlinal, the extension effect was more readily observed due to the presence of a greater number of faults. Within this section, the size of the eroded area appeared to increase at approximately 500 ms depth. Within all three seismic sections, the stratigraphic units between the Devonian and the Cretaceous eras could easily be followed by simple visual inspection. Within the central seismic section in particular, the stratigraphic units were particularly clear. Therefore, this section was used as a reference to assist with interpretation of the other seismic sections. Interpretation of the stratigraphic layers within this section was performed by referencing the Yullerroo- 1 and Yullerroo- 2 well logs collected as part of the Western Australian Well Completion Report (1965). Within this report a layer of Broome sandstone deposited within the Cretaceous era was described {{at the top of the}} seismic section. This layer was located within the section at an approximate depth of 150 ms. Below this layer, there were sequential deposits of Jarlemai siltstone, the Alexander formation, and Wallal sandstone. These were determined to exist at approximately between 150 ms and 500 ms depth which would correspond to deposition within the Jurassic era. Below these Jurassic units, approximately between 500 ms and 1600 ms, the Grant groups, the Anderson formation and the Yulleroo formation, which belong to the Carboniferous era, were detected within the central seismic reflection section. The interface of the Devonian age was able to be marked on the seismic reflection sections but it was not possible to make further comments or findings about the geological units for this time period due to the data quality at this depth. At the Yulleroo- 1 well, it appeared that there was evidence of gas within the Yulleroo formation between 3342 - 3357 m and again at 3395 - 3408 m. In addition, at the Yulleroo- 1 well it appeared that Unit C of the Anderson formation contained a good source rock. Furthermore, at the Yulleroo- 2 well, further evidence of natural gas was found at ten different points between 2855 m and 2980 m. The likelihood of petrochemicals being found in the study area is high due to the properties of the Anderson formation, which was deposited during the Carboniferous era. Previous stratigraphic section findings have suggested that this formation could be made up of reservoir rock. The seismic attributes of potential gas containing areas, as determined by the instantaneous amplitude and frequency, suggested further evidence of the presence of hydrocarbons. The area with the greatest evidence for the presence of hydrocarbons at both the Yulleroo- 1 and Yulleroo- 2 wells was best represented in the central seismic reflection line between 1150 ms and 1300 ms deep and was situated within the Yulleroo anticlinal. In the well logs, the evidence suggested that the depth of the gas layers fluctuated between 5 m and 20 m. In the seismic reflection section, which had a maximum lateral resolution of 20 m, evidence for the potential gas layer could not be detected. In this study, a flat spot was found in an interface in the Anderson formation on the seismic reflection sections. Seismic attributes were applied to this flat spot and the immediate surroundings on the all of the seismic reflection sections. Therefore the instantaneous amplitude section and instantaneous frequency sections were provided for the immediate area around the flat spot. The interface, which was located on the seismic reflection line closest to the Yulleroo- 1 well (central), at approximately 980 ms depth, showed high amplitude values within the instantaneous amplitude section. The instantaneous frequency section for the same interface had substantially lower frequency values. These findings, when taken together with the well logs and stratigraphic information, supported the existence of natural gas above the unit C of the Anderson formation. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
