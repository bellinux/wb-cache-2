5|$|Services were {{originally}} flown using a Dornier Do 328 operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia. Later in that year, Krohn Air acquired a <b>Jetstream</b> 32 and started flights from Molde to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola, but these services {{did not have}} sufficient patronage and were later terminated. By 2011, the aircraft operation was transferred to Helitrans. In the spring of 2013 the aircraft operation was transferred to AIS Airlines, using two British Aerospace <b>Jetstream</b> 32. The airline started a service from Ålesund Airport, Vigra to Trondheim in March 2013, but pulled out in September. The airline ceased operations on 4 February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Krohn Air was {{a virtual}} airline, {{with a single}} <b>Jetstream</b> 32 {{operated}} by AIS Airlines. The airline provided two daily round trips between Molde Airport, Årø and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. As of 2013 Claus Krohn owned 90 percent of the company, and Roy Uren was co-owner.|$|E

The anime series was later licensed in North America by Toonami <b>Jetstream</b> as a joint effort with Viz Media, and aired on December 17, 2007 on its site, but before its completion, the streaming service was shut down. The whole series was streamed in English by Crunchyroll, while Sentai Filmworks licensed the series, with distribution from Section23 Films on DVDs.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} the codeshare {{termination}} with WestAir and Mesa was immediate. The termination put 87 (21 <b>Jetstreams,</b> 29 Brasilias, and 37 Beech 1900s) of Mesa's 184 aircraft out of service or 47% of its total aircraft. Mesa took immediate steps, parking the <b>Jetstreams</b> and Brasilias. It sold 10 Brasilias to Skywest. Mesa exercised the option to purchase 16 additional CRJs and traded in the remaining Brasilias to Bombardier for CRJs. Mesa sold 24 Beech 1900s to Great Lakes, and returned the remaining Beech 1900s to Beechcraft/Raytheon. WestAir ceased operations in 1998.|$|R

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of <b>jetstream</b> interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, a {{contract}} was signed with Haugesund-based Coast Air, who would operate <b>Jetstream</b> 31 aircraft between Skien and Bergen. The owner of Coast Air, Kystfly, also bought 20% of Vildanden. Coast Air had previously operated routes from Skien to Western Norway, but had withdrawn in 1999. Following the announcement from Vildanden and Coast Air, the municipality {{decided to not}} close the airport, and cover the estimated NOK300,000 annual deficit, as well as upgrade the control tower for NOK700,000.

5|$|On 19 April, a new <b>Jetstream</b> 32 {{aircraft}} {{was taken into}} service. This allowed capacity to increase from 12 to 19 passengers, {{and at the same}} time travel time was reduced from 47 to 39 minutes. By September, the most popular departures were being booked full, and Vildanden asked Coast Air for a larger aircraft, with about 30 seats. In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher comfort, and allow a more flexible ticket pricing scheme. An agreement with Danish Air Transport (DAT) to operate an ATR 42, with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed in mid-October.|$|E
5|$|Vildanden AS ("The Wild Duck") was a virtual, {{regional}} airline {{based at}} Skien Airport, Geiteryggen in Norway, {{where it was}} the only airline. With operations starting in 2005, it flew to Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger using a <b>Jetstream</b> 32 and an ATR 42, which is wet leased from Danish Air Transport (DAT) and Helitrans. Previously, the airline has also served Stockholm and Molde, and has also operated Saab 340 aircraft, operated by Coast Air, Air Aurora and Avitrans. The airline hadbeen in conflict with Coast Air about terminating the wet lease agreement. The company has had to be bailed out several times, including by the municipality, until it managed to make its first profit in 2009. It ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines {{route from}} Molde to Bergen {{was taken over}} by Widerøe. However, while Scandinavian Airlines {{previously}} flew from Molde at 06:45, Widerøe's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn Air had just bought a <b>Jetstream</b> 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen. The Bergen service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E
25|$|The airline was {{purchased}} by SAS Group in January 1998, who replaced its <b>Jetstreams</b> with Saab 340s later that year. Air Botnia received its first jets, Fokker F28 Fellowships, in 1999. The elderly F28s were soon replaced as their high noise levels restricted operations, with Avro RJ85s being received in 2001. The Saab 340s were replaced by larger Saab 2000s at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{scheduled service}} into Penticton {{was met with}} resistance {{by means of a}} Transport Canada representative. Unsatisfied with the <b>Jetstream's</b> single engine performance, it was decided that, {{in the event of an}} engine failure, the aircraft could not make it safely back out of the valley in which Penticton lies. Multiple revisions of approach procedures occurred, each which had to be reviewed and approved.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, the <b>Jetstreams</b> were {{replaced}} by Avenger T1 aircraft, modified Hawker Beechcraft King Air 350ERs, {{as part of the}} UK Military Flying Training System.

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level <b>jetstream</b> known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{carried out}} a major {{overhaul}} of its fleet in 1996. The four One-Elevens were sold and replaced with newer Boeing 737-500s. Meanwhile, a <b>Jetstream</b> 41 was transferred from British Airways, replacing the smaller <b>Jetstream</b> 31s. The services to Dublin, Cork and Glasgow were terminated and instead a route was started to Lyon.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of commencing {{operations}} in July 1993, Maersk Air UK operated a fleet of five BAC One-Elevens and three <b>Jetstream</b> 31s out of Birmingham Airport. Routes were flown to Amsterdam, Belfast, Copenhagen, Cork, Dublin, Glasgow, Milan, Newcastle and Stuttgart. As of 1994 it had 185 employees. The airline carried out a major overhaul of its fleet in 1996. The four One-Elevens were sold to Nationwide Air Charter and replaced with newer Boeing 737-500s.

But, {{at the beginning of}} June the <b>jetstreams</b> vanish above the Tibetan Plateau, low pressure over the Indus Valley deepens and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.|$|R

500|$|With {{no other}} civil traffic {{operating}} at its cruising altitude of about , Concorde had exclusive use of dedicated oceanic airways, or [...] "tracks", {{separate from the}} North Atlantic Tracks, the routes used by other aircraft to cross the Atlantic. Due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes, these dedicated SST tracks had fixed co-ordinates, unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes, whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns (<b>jetstreams).</b> Concorde would also be cleared in a [...] block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to [...] during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.

40|$|Analyses of research-aircraft observations, {{satellite}} total-columnar-ozone retrievals, and synoptic upper-air soundings {{are used}} to describe the structure of Arctic <b>jetstreams</b> and their associated frontal zones and tropopause folds. These analyses document the presence of major tropopause folding events within the Arctic that occur at the flanks of large-scale (about 2000 km) polar vortices. One example shows a solar vortex and its associated tropopause fold and Arctic front that migrated from the high Canadian Arctic southward into midlatitudes over central North America. Total columnar ozone measurements from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer are shown to identify the location of polar vortices and the mesoscale (about 200 km) ozone gradients at the flanks of these vortices, which coincide with regions of Arctic tropopause folding and associated stratospheric-tropospheric exchange processes...|$|R
