25|$|On 21 October 1960, Francisco Morazan began {{what was}} to be her last voyage from Miami, Florida. She sailed to Montreal and Toronto, where she {{unloaded}} a cargo of phosphates. Francisco Morazan then sailed to Chicago, arriving there in mid-November. At Chicago, 1,118 tons, 10 cwt of mixed cargo was loaded, destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. The cargo included aluminium, baled hair, bottle caps, canned chicken, castings, chemicals, <b>Gilsonite,</b> hides, lard, machinery, phosphate, scrap metal, solder dross, tinplate, and toys. Francisco Morazan departed Chicago on 28 November. Fog on Lake Michigan slowed her progress and a problem with the feed pump for the boiler required the ship to be stopped while the pump was repaired. This meant Francisco Morazan was now in a race to leave the Great Lakes before the system closed to navigation on 3 December.|$|E
50|$|There are inch-wide, black-colored, subvertical, northwest-southeast {{trending}} <b>gilsonite</b> dikes {{that have}} intruded the rocks at Fantasy Canyon. <b>Gilsonite,</b> named after U.S. Marshall Samuel H. Gilson, {{is a type}} of asphaltite - solidified hydrocarbons. <b>Gilsonite</b> was discovered in the early 1860s. Starting in the mid-1880s, Gilson promoted the material as a waterproof coating for wooden pilings, as an insulation for wire cable, and as a unique varnish.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, a {{pipeline}} was constructed along an abandoned Uintah Railway track {{to carry a}} mixture of crushed <b>gilsonite</b> ore and water from Bonanza, Utah to Loma. The American <b>Gilsonite</b> Company owned the slurry line, and built a plant in Loma where the <b>gilsonite</b> was refined into gasoline, [...] "gilsapave" [...] paving tar, and briquettes used for aluminum refining. The plant was later purchased by Gary Refining.|$|E
30|$|Oil-based {{drilling}} fluids {{are effective in}} drilling shale formations because the clay minerals do not hydrate {{in this type of}} {{drilling fluids}} (Bunger et al. 2014). However, the oil-based drilling fluid is expensive and not environmentally friendly (Shivhare and Kuru 2014; Simpson et al. 1995; Young and Friedheim 2013). Governments and environmental departments in developed countries have introduced stricter regulations to treat all kinds of drilling waste. Increasingly stricter environmental regulations will require more environmentally friendly water-based drilling fluids. Several issues need to be resolved before water-based drilling fluids can be used. The diffusion of water into shale results in swelling, delaminating, and fracturing (van Oort 1994). Otherwise, horizontal drilling requires drilling fluids with better performance to achieve wellbore stability due to the long period of interaction of water-based drilling fluids with shale formations (Mohiuddin et al. 2007). Inhibitors are commonly used in drilling fluids to prevent clay swelling. In recent years, Zhong et al. 2012 proposed that poly(oxypropylene)-amidoamine (POAA) was a potential shale inhibitor in water-based drilling fluids. Qu et al. (2009) investigated the performance of polyoxyalkyleneamine to prevent shale hydration and swelling, but the inhibiting ability was insufficient when polyoxyalkyleneamine was used in water-based fluids during drilling shale formations. Shadizadeh et al. (2015) reported a novel nonionic surfactant extracted from a plant leaf for inhibiting shale hydration. An et al. (2015) evaluated the inhibition of chitosan quaternary ammonium salt (HTCC), and its inhibiting ability was better than polyether amine, but the cost of HTCC was high. The commonly used inhibitors include KCl, CaCl 2, NH 4 Cl, modified <b>gilsonites,</b> and asphalts (Gholizadeh-Dooechaly et al. 2009; Xiong et al. 2012). However, these approaches have some disadvantages, for example, short effectiveness, toxicity, low heat and salinity tolerance and pH sensitivity and expense. The inhibiting ability of inhibitors was enough in drilling traditional reservoirs, but the hydration of water-sensitive shale was not completely controlled. A series of wellbore instability problems have happened during drilling shale formations with water-based drilling fluids. How to enhance the inhibiting ability of inhibitors is a crucial solution to wellbore instability of shale formations.|$|R
50|$|The mineral <b>Gilsonite</b> is {{categorized}} as a solvable material in oil solutions such as CS2 or TCE (Trichloroethylene). Major component of <b>Gilsonite</b> is Carbon, while it contains several other elements including Nitrogen and Sulphur and some volatile matters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gilsonite</b> is a {{flammable}} hydrocarbon mixture, and Dragon {{experienced a}} number of mining accidents. In 1908, a fire started in one section of Dragon's <b>Gilsonite</b> vein. A nearly inextinguishable fire similar to a coal seam fire, it was still burning two years later. Also in 1908, {{an explosion in the}} Black Dragon Mine killed two miners. In 1910, a costly fire sparked in stored <b>Gilsonite</b> completely destroyed the Uintah Railway warehouse, along with hundreds of tons of freight.|$|E

50|$|Mining <b>Gilsonite</b> during World War II was by hand, using a six-pound {{pick and}} then {{shoveling}} the ore into 200 pound sacks, which were sewn by hand. In 1949 at the Parriette <b>Gilsonite</b> mine near Myton, Utah, Reed Smoot McConkie set {{the world record}} for ore mined by hand. Using his pick and shovel, he mined 175 bags of ore in an 8-hour day, 950 bags in a six-day week, 1925 bags in a month and 15,000 bags in one year.|$|E
5000|$|By 1938, {{all of the}} <b>Gilsonite</b> mining {{activity}} moved still further north, to the Bonanza area. The Dragon and Rainbow mines closed down. Trucks to Vernal and Craig, Colorado replaced trains for hauling <b>Gilsonite.</b> People started to abandon Dragon, Rainbow, and Watson. In 1939 Dragon's population was just 72, mostly railroad workers. Having lost {{the majority of its}} freight business, the Uintah Railway ceased operation in 1939. The 1940 census recorded a [...] "South Dragon precinct" [...] population of 10.|$|E

50|$|Dragon is a {{ghost town}} located in Uintah County, at the extreme eastern edge of Utah, United States. Founded in about 1888 as a <b>Gilsonite</b> mining camp, Dragon boomed {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century as the end-of-line town for the Uintah Railway. Although it {{declined}} when the terminus moved farther north in 1911, Dragon survived as the largest of the <b>Gilsonite</b> towns. It was abandoned after its mining operations stopped in 1938 and the Uintah Railway went out of business in 1939.|$|E
50|$|Dragon lies on {{the tiny}} Evacuation Creek {{at the mouth of}} Dragon Canyon, {{approximately}} 1 mi west of the Colorado state line and 65 mi southeast of Vernal, the area's main city. This part of the Uinta Basin has been isolated and barren throughout modern times. The reason for the town's existence was the veins of natural asphalt called <b>Gilsonite,</b> found nowhere else in the world, that run southeast to northwest through this region.The present-day center of <b>Gilsonite</b> mining, Bonanza, is about 25 mi to the north of Dragon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gilsonite</b> is mined in {{underground}} shafts and resembles {{shiny black}} obsidian. Discovered in the 1860s, {{it was first}} marketed as a lacquer, electrical insulator, and waterproofing compound about twenty-five years later by Samuel H. Gilson.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the only}} one of its kind, a <b>gilsonite</b> plant near Bonanza, {{southeast}} of Vernal, Utah, mines this unique, lustrous, brittle form of asphalt, for use in [...] "varnishes, paints,...ink, waterproofing compounds, electrical insulation,...roofing materials." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{extraction}} {{of natural resources}} including oil, natural gas, phosphate, and <b>gilsonite</b> constitute primary economic activity of Uintah County. There is some agriculture in Uintah County, primarily focusing on raising cattle and sheep, and cultivating alfalfa.|$|E
5000|$|Vernal's {{economy is}} based on extracting natural resources, {{including}} petroleum, natural gas, phosphate, and uintaite (more commonly known as <b>Gilsonite).</b> [...] This {{has led to the}} establishment of branch offices of companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger.|$|E
50|$|The Uintah Basin {{includes}} seams of asphaltum remaining where petroleum {{from the}} Green River Formation oil shales seeped into fissures in the overlying sandstone where smaller hydrocarbon molecules were slowly evaporated or digested by aerobic microbes. The remaining large-molecular-weight hydrocarbons formed a lustrous black solid at ambient temperatures, resembling anthracite coal with a brownish dust. Following ignition, the heat generated by combustion causes the burning asphaltum to melt and flow. European Americans began mining this asphaltum in the 1860s, but attempts to burn it in conventional coal stoves were unsuccessful. The asphaltum was named <b>Gilsonite</b> after Samuel Henry Gilson began using {{the material in}} 1886 as a varnish and as electrical insulation. Gilson built a manufacturing plant in Salt Lake City, and began mining operations in 1888. The plant was purchased {{by a group of}} Missouri businessmen who formed the <b>Gilsonite</b> Asphaltum Company. For more than a decade, <b>Gilsonite</b> was hauled from the mines in horse-drawn wagons to be loaded aboard railway cars at Price, Utah. The wagons took ten or eleven days to make a round trip, and the hauling costs encouraged construction of a railroad.|$|E
5000|$|Hunt defines bitumen {{as native}} {{substance}} of variable color, viscosity, and volatility composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen. He further defines petroleum {{as a form}} of bitumen that is gaseous or liquid in the reservoir and can be produced through a pipe. Other bitumens range from very viscous (e.g., Athabasca and Venezuelan heavy oils, La Brea tar pits) to solid (e.g. <b>gilsonite,</b> ozocerite, grahamite, impsonite). Pyrobitumen is formed by thermal decomposition and molecular cross-linking of bitumen. Pyrobitumen is distinguished from other solid bitumens extruded from early-mature kerogen-rich source rocks (e.g., <b>gilsonite)</b> and semi-solid bitumens in high viscosity oil sands formed by water washing and biodegradation of conventional oil (e.g., Athabasca bituminous sands), all of which are soluble in carbon disulfide.|$|E
50|$|This unique mineral {{is used in}} {{more than}} 160 products, {{primarily}} in dark-colored printing inks and paints, oil well drilling muds and cements, asphalt modifiers, foundry sand additives, and {{a wide variety of}} chemical products. The trademark, registered in 1921, belongs to the American <b>Gilsonite</b> Company.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gilsonite</b> was {{discovered}} in 1888 at Bonanza, in central Uintah County. This was on Reservation land, but miners pressured the US government to remove some 7000 acres (11 square miles; 28 km²) for mining use. Mining and its associated activities (including relative lawlessness) rapidly boomed in that area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gilsonite,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "uintahite", [...] "asphaltum" [...] or asphaltite, is a {{naturally}} occurring solid hydrocarbon, a form of asphalt (or bitumen) with a relatively high melting temperature. The substance is mainly found in the Uintah Basin of Utah and Colorado, United States. Although it occurs also in other locations, its large-scale production occurs only in the Uintah Basin.|$|E
5000|$|Pyrobitumen {{is a type}} of solid, {{amorphous}} organic matter. Pyrobitumen {{is mostly}} insoluble in CS2 (and other organic solvents) as a result of molecular cross-linking which renders previously soluble organic matter (i.e., bitumen) insoluble., [...] Not all solid bitumens are pyrobitumens, in that some solid bitumens (e.g., <b>gilsonite)</b> are soluble in common organic solvents, including CS2, dichloromethane, and benzene-methanol mixtures.|$|E
5000|$|At the 1910 census, the {{population}} of [...] "Dragon Precinct" [...] (the town and surrounding area) was 287. The output of the Black Dragon Mine was declining, however, and other rich <b>Gilsonite</b> deposits had been discovered to the north. In 1911 the Uintah Railway extended its line northward, establishing a new end-of-line town called Watson 9.5 mi north of Dragon, with a spur line 4 mi to the southwest of Watson to Rainbow, the new mining center. The loss of the railroad terminus caused a moderate decline in Dragon, but because the railroad's shops and roundhouse were still here, Dragon remained the stable population center in the <b>Gilsonite</b> mining area. The railroad saw the need to encourage the shipping of diverse products, and in 1912 they built large sheep shearing pens at Dragon. Enough people remained in 1917 to support a renovation of the Dragon schoolhouse. The census precinct, greatly expanded but still named for Dragon, reported populations of 487 in 1920 and 452 in 1930.|$|E
50|$|Bitumen {{may occur}} in {{hydrothermal}} veins. An {{example of this}} is within the Uinta Basin of Utah, in the US, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed <b>Gilsonite.</b> These veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the Green River Formation during burial and diagenesis.|$|E
50|$|By 1888 Gilson {{had started}} a company to mine the substance, but soon {{discovered}} the vein was located on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Under great political pressure Congress removed some 7000 acre from the reservation on May 24, 1888 to allow the mining to proceed legally. <b>Gilsonite</b> mining became the first large commercial enterprise in the Uintah Basin, causing most of its early population growth.|$|E
50|$|As the {{commercial}} mining of <b>Gilsonite</b> began in 1888, a significant deposit was discovered some 1.5 mi up Dragon Canyon. Observers {{said that the}} vein of the black substance formed {{the shape of a}} dragon along the surface of the ground, and the operation was named the Black Dragon Mine. The name Dragon was soon given to both the canyon and the mining camp that grew up in the flat area at the canyon's mouth.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of screen}} scroll {{centrifuge}} {{has been seen}} in numerous process engineering industries. One of the most noticeable applications is within coal preparation industry. In addition to that, this centrifuge is also employed in the dewatering of potash, <b>gilsonite,</b> in salt processes and in dewatering various sands. Moreover, it is also designed {{for use in the}} food processing industry, for instant, dairy production, and cocoa butter equivalents and other confectionery fats.|$|E
5000|$|Tar pits are {{composed}} of heavy oil fractions called <b>gilsonite,</b> which seeped from the Earth as oil. In Hancock Park, crude oil seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park. [...] The oil reaches the surface and forms pools at several locations in the park, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum biodegrade or evaporate.|$|E
50|$|The railway {{company was}} founded in 1903 as a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of the Gilson Asphaltum Company. Construction began at a connection with the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad at {{what became known as}} Mack, Colorado. Twenty-eight miles of track was laid following West Salt Wash Creek upstream to the company town of Atchee, Colorado, named after a chief of the Ute people. Atchee served as a division point with maintenance shops for railway equipment. From Atchee, six miles of 7.5 percent grade were required to climb the Book Cliffs to Baxter Pass at an elevation of 8437 ft. From the summit of Baxter Pass, there were seven miles of 5 percent downhill grade to Wendella, Colorado, followed by twelve miles of 3 percent or shallower grades down Evacuation Creek to the Black Dragon Mine just west of the Utah border. The Black Dragon Vein of <b>Gilsonite</b> was exposed across the ground surface for a distance of 4 mile km, and averaged 6 ft wide for half of that distance. Trains began hauling <b>Gilsonite</b> from the Black Dragon Mine in October, 1904. Shay locomotives pulled freight trains over Baxter Pass between the Dragon Mine and Atchee, and 2-8-0 engines pulled the freight trains between Atchee and Mack.|$|E
50|$|Nine Mile Road was {{constructed}} through the canyon in 1886 by the Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, linking Fort Duchesne to the railroad {{through the city}} of Price. Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of <b>Gilsonite</b> in the Uinta Basin. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah {{until well into the}} 20th century. Most of the stagecoach, mail, freight, and telegraph traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Nine Mile until after the arrival of the Uintah Railway around 1905.|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{lasted until}} 1939 when trucks took over hauling the <b>Gilsonite.</b> At that time, the rails were {{pulled up and}} the towns abandoned. Most of the railway's locomotives were scrapped immediately; the two famous articulateds were sold to the Sumpter Valley Railway in Oregon, and later went to Guatemala, where they were dismantled. Today {{all that remains of}} the Uintah are the cellar pits of some of the buildings, the shell of the machine shop in Atchee, a few pieces of rolling stock, and part of the company hotel in Mack.|$|E
