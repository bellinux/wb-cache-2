50|$|Porosity logs {{measure the}} {{fraction}} or percentage of pore volume in {{a volume of}} rock. Most porosity logs use either acoustic or nuclear technology. Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the well-bore environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions {{that take place in}} the <b>downhole</b> <b>logging</b> instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation. The basic principle behind the use of nuclear technology is that a neutron source placed near the formation whose porosity is being measured will result in neutrons being scattered by the hydrogen atoms, largely those present in the formation fluid. Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical resistivity measurements is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Downhole</b> <b>logs</b> {{have proven}} to be {{critical}} in quantifying natural gas hydrates found in marine sediments and the seismic signature associated with free gas below. In recent drilling on the Blake Ridge, the Ocean Drilling Program recorded in situ velocity and resistivity logs that reveal an increasing amount of hydrate with depth in the pressure-temperature stability window. The associated increase in shear igidity (decrease in Vp/Vs ratio) and decrease in acoustic amplitude over this interval is attributed to the cementation of sediment grains by hydrate, which may also explain the prevalent seismic Nanking across the Blake Ridge. In future drilling campaigns, the use of 'logging-while-drilling' (LWD) sensors placed just above the drill bit will improve the in situ estimation ofporosity, lateral variability and hydrocarbon reservoir potential of natural gas hydrates. <b>Downhole</b> <b>logs</b> in sedimentary basins can reveal in situ properties that are difficult to measure in laboratory samples, such as those in gas hydrates and gas-rich zones which dissociate or severely alter during the process of coring.

The LPTM {{consists of a}} 0. 3 - 0. 97 m calcareous claystone to claystone horizon. High-resolution <b>downhole</b> <b>logging</b> (Formation MicroScanner [FMS]), standard downhole logs (resistivity, velocity, density, natural gamma ray, and geochemical log), and non-destructive chemical and physical property (multisensor core logger [MSCL] and X-ray fluorescence [XRF] core scanner) data were used to identify composite sections from parallel holes and to record sedimentological and environmental changes associated with the LPTM. <b>Downhole</b> <b>logging</b> data indicate an abrupt and distinct difference in {{physical and chemical properties}} that extend for tens of meters above and below the LPTM. These observations indicate a rapid environmental change at the LPTM, which persists beyond the LPTM anomaly.

Because gas hydrate is unstable at surface pressure and temperature conditions, a major emphasis was placed on the <b>downhole</b> <b>logging</b> program to determine the in situ physical properties of the gas hydrate-bearing sediments. <b>Downhole</b> <b>logging</b> tool strings deployed on Leg 164 included the Schlumberger quad-combination tool (NGT, LSS/SDT, DIT, CNT-G, HLDT), the Formation MicroScanner (FMS), and the Geochemical Combination Tool (GST).

The natural gamma radiation (NGR) and magnetic susceptibility logs are particularly useful for understanding lithological and paleoenvironmental change at ANDRILL McMurdo Ice Shelf Hole AND- 1 B.

40|$|The first well logs {{collected}} {{below the}} Antarctic circle were obtained during Leg 113 at Site 693 on the Dronning Maud Land Margin (Antarctica) in the Weddell Sea. Gamma-ray, resistivity, and sonic logs were collected between 108. 0 and 439. 0 mbsf. The <b>downhole</b> <b>logs</b> show good {{agreement with the}} data collected from cores and provide a con-tinuous measurement of the sedimentary record. These continuous log records show that the rather uniform Tertiary li-thology seen in cores is characterized by high-frequency variability in the log data. Several thin hard streaks are identi-fied, the largest of which coincides with a major Miocene hiatus. Associated with this hiatus is a change to lower illite content (and correspondingly lower gamma-ray counts) and to {{a significant increase in}} diatom content. Spectral analysis of the logs was performed on the lower Pliocene through upper Oligocene interval (108. 0 - 343. 0 mbsf). Between 108. 0 and 245. 0 mbsf, average sedimentation rates (50 and 26 m/m. y.) are high enough to show that variance is present in the orbital eccentricity (— 95 k. y.) and obliquity (— 41 k. y.) bands. Between 253. 0 and 343. 0 mbsf, the sedimentation rate (8 m/m. y.) is too low to resolve high frequency variations. The Milankovitch frequencies are best developed in the resistivity logs. Resistivity is responding to changes in porosity, which in these sediments is controlled by the abundance of biosiliceous sediments, particularly diatoms. The orbital forcing suggested by the Milankovitch frequencies may be influencing diatom productivity by inducing oscillations in upwelling, ice coverage, pack ice, and/or polynya. Although variations in diatom abundance were observed in the cores, they were not attributed to a Mi-lankovitch signal, and therefore in this environment, <b>downhole</b> <b>logs</b> are an important contribution to the detection and understanding of orbitally influenced changes in sedimentation...|$|R

The post-collisional phase includes the early Pleistocene development of strike-slip faults, responsible of lateral variations and of the segmentation of the belt. The last tectonic phase that affected the belt is relative to an extensional regime characterized by NW-SE faults and is still acting. Present-day stress state can be assessed by different techniques, such as borehole breakouts, focal mechanism solutions, active faults, hydrofracturing, overcoring, crustal deformation and differential strain. Our goals are to compare the local versus regional active stress in Irpinia region and to identify active shear zones along a deep well using borehole breakout and <b>downhole</b> <b>log</b> data. The selected area is characterized by diffuse low magnitude seismicity, although in historical times it was repeatedly struck by moderate to large earthquakes. On 23 rd November 1980 a strong earthquake (M= 6. 9) occurred in this area producing the first unequivocal historical surface faulting ever documented in Italy.

The surface trace of this fault {{is very close to}} the San Gregorio Magno 1 deep oil well which should cross it approximately within an interval depth of 1500 m. To discriminate the presence of the Irpinia fault and other possible active shear zones and to define the present-day stress along San Gregorio Magno 1 well, we have analyzed in detail borehole breakout and downhole geophysical data. Our analysis of stress-induced wellbore breakouts shows a direction of minimum horizontal stress N 18 °± 24 °, quite consistent to the regional Shmin trend (N 44 °± 20 °). Although some breakout zones with a different trend from the regional one have been identified, these have been related to slip on nearby faults.

Typically, the spliced, continuous sediment sections were found to be about 10 % longer than the section drilled, as measured by the length of the drill string. While the source of this elongation is not yet fully understood, it must be compensated for in order to property determine sediment fluxes and mass accumulation rates. <b>Downhole</b> <b>logging,</b> in conjunction with inverse correlation techniques provided a means to determine where the distortion occurred and to correct back to true in situ depths. <b>Downhole</b> <b>logging</b> also provides a means, through the generation of synthetic seismograms, of precisely relating the paleoceanographic events found in the core record to the high-resolution seismic record. Once correlated to the seismic record, the spatial and temporal extent of paleoceanographic events can be traced well beyond the borehole.

Downhole and on-core measurements through the targeted Lower Seve Nappe provide a comprehensive data set. An observed gradual increase in strain below 1700 m, with mica schists and intermittent mylonites increasing in frequency and thickness, is here interpreted as the basal thrust zone of the Lower Seve Nappe. This high strain zone was not fully penetrated at the total drilled depth and is thus greater than 800 m in thickness. To allow extrapolation of the results from <b>downhole</b> <b>logging,</b> core analysis and other experiments into the surrounding rock and to link these with the regional tectonic setting and evolution, three post-drilling high-resolution seismic experiments were conducted in and around the borehole. One of these, the first 3 D seismic reflection land survey to target the nappe structures of the Scandinavian Caledonides, is presented here. It provides new information on the 3 D geometry of structures both within the drilled Lower Seve Nappe and underlying rocks down to at least 9 km. The observed reflectivity correlates well with results from the core analysis and <b>downhole</b> <b>logging,</b> despite challenges in processing.

These conclusions were confirmed when estimating temperatures in eight actual wells, using 50 <b>downhole</b> temperature <b>logs</b> from other wells in the geothermal area. It was found that, for this particular case, neuronet teaching utilizing 30 well logs results in an average forecast error of 20 %. As the number of training logs increases (up to 50), the error slightly decreases (down to 16. 9 %). The effects of the teaching data pattern (conductive-type versus convective-type of temperature profiles) were also studied, and an optimal strategy was developed for the neuronet training, based on the information available...|$|R

Significant variations occurred in sediment properties on all time scales as seen in the high-resolution nondestructive shipboard measurements (e. g., bulk density and color reflectance), high- to intermediate-resolution <b>downhole</b> <b>log</b> measurements (e. g., resistivity and magnetic susceptibility), and lower resolution discrete shipboard measurements (e. g., physical properties and carbon geochemistry). Thus, these Leg 167 sites provide an opportunity to address paleoceanographic questions about the evolution of the California Current and links between the equatorial Pacific and the high-latitude North Pacific from millennial and orbital to tectonic time scales. This data report presents the results of biogenic opal analyses from a latitudinal transect of seven sites along the California margin for the time interval from 8 Ma to the present. Site selection for opal analyses was based upon such parameters as opal content, stratigraphic continuity, and lack of coring disturbance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cores {{offer the}} ability to {{describe}} lithological, physical, and chemical properties of rocks at the millimetre and smaller scale. However, continuous coring is expensive and only occasionally recovers 100 % of the drilled interval. Microresistivity images of the borehole wall depict features down to the centimetre and smaller scale and can complement, {{or in some cases}} ubstitute for, core description as a means of geologic interpretation. This paper describes two techniques of integrating core data with borehole image and log data. Two case studies in carbonate rocks recovered uring Ocean Drilling Program Legs 160 and 166 are presented. Microresistivity log images, grey-scale reflectivity from corephotographs, and gamma ray logs are correlated at the centimetre scale ov r up to 300 -metre cored intervals. Direct visual correlation of core photographs with borehole images and correlation f gamma ray measurements on core with <b>downhole</b> <b>logs</b> are shown to be complementary techniques. High-resolution core-log depth matching may be best achieved by correlating multiple datasets to reduce the error inherent in each and more precisely constrain depth matching. Depth matching of individual features allows a more accurate and consistent depth scale fo...|$|R
