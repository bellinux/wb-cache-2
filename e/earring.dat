5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each <b>earring</b> on a child had to be purchased at an expensive potlatch. Earrings were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in their ears.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an <b>earring,</b> a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E

5|$|The Manikarnika Ghat is the Mahasmasana, {{the primary}} site for Hindu {{cremation}} in the city. Adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms {{that are used}} for death anniversary rituals.

However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an <b>earring</b> (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is fairly common.|$|E
5|$|In Variety opinion, Johansson's {{roles in}} Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl <b>Earring</b> {{established}} her {{as among the}} most versatile actresses of her generation. Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film The Perfect Score, the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long, and the drama A Good Woman—were critical and commercial failures. Co-starring with John Travolta, Johansson played a discontented and suspicious teenager in A Love Song for Bobby Long, {{which is based on}} the novel Off Magazine Street by Ronald Everett Capps. Variety David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.|$|E

5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice.

This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest <b>earrings</b> found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. <b>Earrings</b> are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the <b>earrings</b> worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted <b>earrings.</b> Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who chooses not to be freed. <b>Earrings</b> are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. <b>Earrings</b> for pierced ears were found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|R

Mercedes believes him, however Lindsey makes Mercedes feel as though she is interrupting on a perfect family with her and Joe. Mercedes then breaks up with Joe, and leaves the village. She returns two months later, and is shocked to learn that Lindsey's younger sister, Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis), has been imprisoned for killing seven patients at the local hospital. Kim's ex-girlfriend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and herself a victim of the killer when they tried to murder her, attempts to convince Mercedes of Kim's innocence.

5|$|Marriage {{negotiations}} {{constituted a}} key element in Elizabeth's foreign policy. She turned down Philip's own hand early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden. For several years she also seriously negotiated to marry Philip's cousin Archduke Charles of Austria. By 1569, relations with the Habsburgs had deteriorated, and Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first Henry, Duke of Anjou, and later, from 1572 to 1581, his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alençon. This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the Southern Netherlands. Elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frog-shaped <b>earring</b> that Anjou had sent her.|$|E

Kalmashapada agreed and directed him to his wife, who refused to part with her <b>earrings</b> until Uttanka brought some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gave him the <b>earrings.</b> The queen warned Uttanka that her <b>earrings</b> were coveted by Nagas, Yakshas, rakshasas and the gods, who would try to steal them. Uttanka was therefore advised not to allow the <b>earrings</b> to touch the ground to prevent the snakes from taking possession of them.|$|R

He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors.

From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant <b>earring.</b> He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder.

5|$|The {{concept of}} Ardhanarishvara {{originated}} in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography {{evolved in the}} Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE). A mid-first century Kushan era stela in the Mathura Museum has a half-male, half-female image, along with three other figures identified with Vishnu, Gaja Lakshmi and Kubera. The male half is ithyphallic or with an urdhvalinga and makes an abhaya mudra gesture; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast. This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara, universally recognized. An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the Mathura Museum. The right male half has matted hair with a skull and crescent moon; the left female half has well-combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra-kundala (<b>earring).</b> The face has a common third eye. A terracotta seal discovered in Vaishali has half-man, half-woman features. Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two-armed form, but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography.|$|E
