5000|$|As the sawmill {{was only}} very small when Johnston took it over, the {{surviving}} boiler and steam engine equipment {{at the site}} of Johnston's sawmill was probably installed between 1914 and 1938. A photograph from [...] shows that the surviving equipment was already in place: the Marshall steam engine and boiler were under separate open-sided sheds, the boiler's brickwork was painted white, and the Walkers steam winch was operating a stiff leg <b>derrick</b> <b>crane.</b> At this time the brick chimney base was shorter and located closer to the boiler. The chimney appears to have been in its current position by 1954.|$|E
50|$|School House Lane was {{the first}} {{terminus}} of the North East railway, opened as a temporary terminus as the girders for the Goulburn River bridge had not yet arrived from England. Located at 59 miles, 20 chains (95.4 kilometres) from Spencer Street it was open for public services between April 18 to August 28, 1872, and was provided with passenger and goods platforms, an engine shed, ash pit, water supply, and a <b>derrick</b> <b>crane.</b> A station building was provided, {{as well as a}} tent with brick chimney for the station master. After the line was extended into Seymour station, School House Lane was closed.|$|E
50|$|A final fire {{destroyed}} Johnston's sawmill in 1963, {{and this}} time it was not rebuilt. The railway to Mount Molloy closed on 30 April the following year. In 1973 a timber shed still existed around the boiler, along with a small shed over the Walkers steam winch, and the <b>derrick</b> <b>crane</b> was still extant. Another shed existed to the southeast of the steam engine, set at a lower level. The buildings and the crane have since been removed. Two other steam engines that were present in 1973 are no longer on site - a Tangye, Birmingham single cylinder vertical engine and a Thompson & Co., Castlemaine, Victoria, single cylinder horizontal engine no.242 (earlier used by Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company). A Pickering type governor was also present in 1973 on top of the Marshall steam engine, but this has since been removed.|$|E

5000|$|The main shed {{was built}} in 1933, {{replacing}} an older horseshoe-shaped granite shed. The Beck and Beck Company, its builder, was established in 1898 {{by members of the}} Beck family, German immigrants who had primarily been ironworkers prior to coming to Vermont. This build was designed to facilitate the movement of granite during its transformation from raw material to finished object, typically cemetery markers. Its design took advantage of the development of the overhead traveling bridge crane, which could be used to move heavy granite blocks within a rectangular facility. (The previous horseshoe-shaped facility was serviced by a centrally-placed <b>derrick</b> <b>crane</b> with a boom, which moved the blocks from arriving railroad cars to areas of the building within range of the boom.) The building continued to be used for granite processing (after 1976 by a succession of different owners) until 2009. [...] It now houses ReSOURCE, a local non-profit that repurposes donated building materials and provides job training and other programs.|$|E
50|$|The Eifel Transmitter (Sender Eifel) is an FM and TV {{transmission}} {{facility for}} the German broadcasting company of SWR and {{is located on}} the Scharteberg near Kirchweiler, Germany. Until 1985, the Scharteberg transmitter used a 160 metre tall guyed mast. However this mast did not allow good reception in deep valleys, so in 1985 a new, 302 metre tall, guyed, steel framework mast was built, becoming the tallest structure of Rhineland-Palatinate.The elements of this mast were built by the firm of Hein, Lehmann AG, whilst construction work was carried out by BBS AG, Ludwigshafen. The first 20 metres of the mast were built using a small crane. The mast elements in heights between 20 and 100 metres were mounted by the aid of a car crane, while for the sections above a <b>derrick</b> <b>crane</b> was used.The new mast of Scharteberg transmitter consists of a 288 metre tall, guyed, lattice, steel structure with a square cross section, a side length of 2.1 metres and a 14 metre long GFK-cylinder on top for the UHF antenna. The total weight of the structure is 204 tons.The mast is guyed at 4 levels, 57, 123, 195 and 273 metres above ground. It is equipped with an elevator which runs up to a height of 281 metres.For aircraft warning 20 red neon lamps and two blinking lights with 1000 watt lamps are installed.|$|E
5000|$|To {{partially}} {{compensate for}} the loss of carrier strength at the Battle of Midway, Navy Aircraft Department began plans to convert the Ise-class battleships to full-sized aircraft carriers each carrying 54 planes. This concept was abandoned due to lack of time and resources and a hybrid battleship/carrier concept was adopted. Ise was dry-docked, and her aft No. 5 and No. 6 main turrets were removed and replaced by a hangar surmounted by a 70 m long flight deck and a [...] "T"-shaped aircraft elevator. This was long enough to permit the launch of aircraft, but not their recovery. Two 25 m Model 11 catapults were installed on tall supports on the port and starboard sides forward of the flight deck. A collapsible <b>derrick</b> <b>crane</b> was fitted port abaft (two cranes were originally planned but installation was not carried out). It was realized that a single faulty aircraft engine could ruin the whole concept, so, to prevent jams, the deck was fitted with two rails to each catapult, 12 turntables, trolleys and tie-downs. Plans called for the new hangar to carry nine planes inside, with 11 on deck and one on each catapult. The new deck was covered with 200 mm of concrete to {{compensate for the}} unbalanced condition created after removal of the aft armament. A 1 m thick layer of concrete was also poured around the main and reserve steering rooms and a 150 mm horizontal armor cover was added.|$|E
50|$|On 12 January 2010, a 7.0 {{magnitude}} earthquake struck, and crippled the port. The {{access road}} to the docks buckled, and slabs of concrete rose six feet above grade. <b>Derrick</b> <b>cranes</b> were thrown into the harbour; the shipping container unloading cranes were left leaning with their bases submerged. The seawall on some slips crumbled, and quayside areas slumped sideways into the harbor, carrying shipping containers into the water. The main pier on {{the northern end of}} the port was completely destroyed, with the cranes in the water, and the terminal collapsed. The south pier was severely damaged.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic approach {{to select the}} best crane type in a construction project from the main crane types, namely, mobile, tower and <b>derrick</b> <b>cranes.</b> Each factor of the project is classified as being dynamic or static according to whether the factor does or {{does not depend on}} the particular project. Linguistic information about the suitability of each crane type with respect to each factor of the project is translated into either fuzzy sets (for static factors) or fuzzy if-then rules (for dynamic factors). The fuzzy rules are then aggregated into a fuzzy relation between the space of factor property and the space of crane efficiency. In a particular project the experts describe the property as well as the relative importance of each factor. The rules are then fired using the max-min extension principle, and the resulting efficiencies are aggregated with their importance weights. The process identifies the best crane as the one with the highest expected overall efficiency. ...|$|R
