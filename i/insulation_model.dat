A cycle of the applied voltage starting from the zero of the positive half cycle was divided into 16 equal phase windows (Φ 1 to Φ 16) and partial discharge (PD) magnitude distribution in each phase was determined. Based on the experimental results, three stages of aging mechanism were identified. Gumbel's extreme value distribution of the largest element was used to model {{the first stage of}} aging process. Second and subsequent stages were modeled using two-parameter Weibull distribution. Spearman's non-parametric rank correlation test statistic and Kolmogrov-Smirnov two sample test were used to relate the aging process of each phase with the corresponding process of the full cycle. To bring out clearly the effect of stress level, its duration and test procedure on the distribution parameters and hence of the aging process, non-parametric ANOVA techniques like Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's LSD multiple comparison tests were used. Results of the analysis show that two phases (Φ 13 and Φ 14) near the vicinity of the negative voltage peak were found to contribute significantly to the aging process and their aging mechanism also correlated well with that of the corresponding full cycle mechanism.

40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are important}} and expensive elements within the electric power transmission and distribution utilities. Since these equipments are connected in series to the network, any inadvertent failures would cause catastrophic interruptions to the power supply. As such, it is extremely critical for the power transformer to operate continuously {{in order to maintain}} a reliable and efficient electricity supply. Ageing or defects in power transformer has a root in its insulation structure and this has always been a well-known fact. For many years, mineral oil impregnated cellulose paper (OIP) has been the choice of insulation for power transformers due to its excellent dielectric properties as well as its inexpensive price. During the course of operation, the dielectric properties of OIP insulation inevitably deteriorate due to singularly or a combination of stresses such as thermal, electrical, mechanical, chemical as well as environmental stresses. Degradation of power transformer insulation is an irreversible process and has been encountered by all power utilities around the world. However, replacing a power transformer simply by its age is impractical and uneconomical. With the increase in the population of ageing power transformers, there is an urgent need to evaluate the condition of transformer insulation so as to facilitate the planning for refurbishment or replacement of the equipment in a more appropriate manner. To address this issue, many techniques involving both chemical and electrical methods have been developed to monitor the insulation condition of oil-filled power transformers. However, some of these techniques are destructive by nature {{and some of them are}} unable to assess the insulation condition accurately. With the advancement in technology over the years, newer diagnostic methods in time and frequency domains have been developed in recent years to assess the insulation condition based on their dielectric responses. One of the newly developed methods is known as Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) measurement and it monitors the insulation condition by measuring the diagnostic parameters as a function of frequency ranging from 0. 1 mHz to 1 kHz. The primary focus of this thesis is to adopt FDS technique to study the effects of several deterioration factors on the dielectric response of transformer insulation, so as to develop a better understanding between FDS technique and the condition of transformer insulation. To study the effects of moisture and temperature, FDS measurements were performed on a CIGRE model transformer at various moisture concentrations and temperature levels. From the experimental results, moisture and temperature have significant impacts on the dielectric response of transformer insulation. In addition to constant temperature, FDS measurements were also performed during transient temperature conditions to investigate the effects of transient temperature on the dielectric response of transformer insulation. An empirical relationship between the dielectric response produced from transient and steady temperature conditions was able to be established from the experimental results. A novel approach to study the effects of geometrical parameters was also part of this research work. An <b>insulation</b> <b>model</b> has been designed and fabricated for the purpose of this study. FDS measurements were conducted on the <b>insulation</b> <b>model</b> with different configurations of barriers, spacers and oil volume. The results showed that geometrical parameters did have an impact on the dielectric response of transformer insulation.

Using the model and a foam concrete density of 580 kg/m 3 the theoretically calculated heat conductivity was 0. 145 W/(m•K) compared with the experimental measured value by TPS of 0. 142 W/(m•K). The relative error between the heoretical value and the experimental value was very low at 2. 1 %.

The <b>insulation</b> <b>model</b> was then added to a heat transferring model to calculate the temperature field of foam concrete wall during a fire incident. Finally, the temperature field of a foam concrete wall and a traditional dense concrete wall during the same fire incident were calculated and compared.

In contrast at a surface temperature of traditional concrete wall was 987. 2 ℃at 360 s at the fire side wall and the lowest temperature in the traditional wall was 102. 9 ℃ at the opposite side wall surface far away from the fire direction.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} focused on the radiooxidative {{degradation}} of polymeric insulation of electric cables used in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). In order to investigate the degradation mechanisms of the <b>insulation,</b> <b>model</b> composites with ATH (Aluminium TriHydrate) filler and blends (without filler) based on a cross-linked mixture of EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate) and EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) were submitted to gamma-rays. In normal operating conditions of a NPP, the dose rate which electric cables are exposed to is around 0. 1 Gy h− 1. In this work, artificial accelerated ageing test process has been applied at a relatively low dose rate of 7 Gy h− 1. Gamma-irradiations at higher dose rates typically used to accelerate the ageing, in the range 0. 2 – 1 kGy h− 1, were also carried out. The first part of the study {{is focused on}} irradiations performed at relatively low dose rate and is devoted to the highlighting of the radiooxidative degradation mechanisms of EVA/EPDM blend with and without ATH filler. Correlations between the evolutions of the chemical, morphological and mechanical/electrical properties of the materials occurring after the ageing process are presented. It is shown that the degradation process is governed by radical oxidation mechanism involving chain scissions leading to the formation of carboxylic acids as end-groups. One of the main effects of the ATH filler is the progressive loss of the mechanical properties of the composite upon radiooxidation whereas they are maintained {{in the case of the}} unfilled sample. Despite the oxidation of the polymer, no change in the electrical properties of the blend and of the composite could be observed. The second part of the study focuses on the dose rate effect. It is shown that one of the main consequences of an increase of the dose rate from 7 Gy h− 1 to 0. 2 – 1 kGy h− 1 is a reduction of the chain scission process yield by a factor of about 20. Therefore, an important and consistent finding is that there are some limits that must not be exceeded in terms of dose rate to ensure a global satisfactorily representativeness of the accelerated ageing process...|$|E

In current research, the effects of silica, kevlar and cork on 			thermal and ablation performances of EPDM based thermal insulators 			have been investigated.

In the next phase of research the concentration of silica was 			limited to 10 Phr (parts per hundred parts of rubber) and kevlar was 			added at various concentrations in order to remove the drawbacks of 			high density and high thermal conductivity of silica filled EPDM. 			Kevlar loadings significantly enhanced thermal and ablation 			performance of silica-EPDM based thermal insulation by forming a 			tough char layer on the surface of the insulator.

Cork, a hydrocarbon material with low density and low thermal 			conductivity was added in various Phr to EPDM loaded with 10 Phr of 			each silica and kevlar.

40|$|The {{combined}} radiation/conduction {{heat transfer}} in high-temperature multi-layer <b>insulations</b> was <b>modeled</b> using a finite volume numerical model. The numerical model was validated {{by comparison with}} steady-state effective thermal conductivity measurements, and by transient thermal tests simulating re-entry aerodynamic heating conditions. A design of experiments technique was used to investigate optimum design of multi-layer insulations for re-entry aerodynamic heating. It was found that use of 2 mm foil spacing and locating the foils near the hot boundary with the top foil 2 mm away from the hot boundary resulted in the most effective insulation design. A 76. 2 mm thick multi-layer insulation using 1, 4, or 16 foils resulted in 2. 9, 7. 2, or 22. 2 percent mass per unit area savings compared to a fibrous insulation sample at the same thickness, respectively...|$|R
