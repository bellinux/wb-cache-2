500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} May 15, 2009 through Reprise Records. Armstrong {{has described the}} album as a [...] "snapshot of the era <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> as we question {{and try to make}} sense of the selfish manipulation going on around us, whether it be the government, religion, media or frankly any form of authority". The singles [...] "Know Your Enemy" [...] and [...] "21 Guns" [...] exemplify the themes of alienation and politically motivated anger present in the record.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to the world <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E

The release of the official music video followed on 17 May 2017 on the same platform, but was not made available to watch until 26 May 2017. It was directed by Manuel Escalante of Enjambre Producciones in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona, with production and photography handled by him along with Petter Lettocha and José Casillas. When interviewed, Muñiz expained {{the concept of the}} visual, [...] " [...] We were very moved by {{the idea of having a}} story of a long-distance virtual and sentimental relationship that is carried out through virtual reality: one in Mexico and the other one in Barcelona. Everything begins [...] when I invariably connect with my partner (Alexandra Stan) through a virtual reality system <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> a super romance and where we see each other in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona." ...|$|E

50|$|We {{were told}} once {{that the land}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> was white man's land.

Then it was allowed that any petty chief should buy themselves ground. The chief Mokgatle said those {{who were able to}} do so could. My father was there and he told me.|$|R
60|$|We {{always knew}} when these {{disorders}} had set in, we {{knew all the}} signs but no medicine availed to stop their progress. Each attack ran its course in spite of nurse and drug whilst I raged helplessly and Zulime grew hollow-eyed with anxious midnight vigil. Death was a never-absent hovering shadow when those bitter winter winds were blowing, and realizing this I came to hate the great desolate city <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived,</b> and to long with the most passionate ardor for the coming of April's sun.|$|R

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the early twenty-first century, the collage techniques of Votre Faust—especially in conjunction with contemporaneous statements by Pousseur about the [...] "information age" [...] <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and the general acceptance of a collective network of creation—are seen as a [...] "prescient commentary on what we have come to call 'postmodern pastiche,' in which different historical registers and styles are mingled in a single work" [...]|$|E
2500|$|The age <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> has, for the public, {{been marked}} by the nuclear {{engineer}} and the gigantic edifices he has created. For builders and visitors alike, nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century. Their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious, religious fulfilment and industrial achievement, the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration, utopia come true and the continued search for harmony.|$|E

6000|$|The {{quiet time}} passed, in the by-street <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived.</b> The outer stir and tumult of Parisian life ran its daily course around us, unnoticed and unheard. Steadily, though slowly, Eustace gained strength. The doctors, with {{a word or}} two of caution, left him almost entirely to me. [...] "You are his physician," [...] they said; [...] "the happier you make him, the sooner he will recover." [...] The quiet, {{monotonous}} round of my new life was far from wearying me. I, too, wanted repose--I had no interests, no pleasures, out of my husband's room.|$|R

Some mainstream examples of Conservative Jewish thought are as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{pattern of}} debate is {{found among the}} {{earliest}} Greek philosophers, known as the pre-Socratics, who provided alternative answers to the same question found in the myths of their neighbors: [...] "How did the ordered cosmos <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> come to be?" [...] But although the question is much the same, their answers and their attitude towards the answers is markedly different. [...] As reported by such later writers as Aristotle, their explanations tended to center on the material source of things.|$|E
60|$|The village <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> {{contained}} a goodly {{number of families}} of high standing and comfortable fortune. It was a village of well-kept and well-shaded streets, of close-cut grass, with no litter on the sidewalks.

I had a fair inheritance from my mother, and this my grandmother desired me to expend without reference to what I was receiving and would receive from her.

2500|$|In {{the legal}} drama Boston Legal, Alan Shore quotes Adlai Stevenson's Nature of Patriotism speech when he defends {{a client who}} has {{withheld}} her taxes to protest {{the current state of}} America. He says, [...] "The tragedy of our day is the climate of fear <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and fear breeds repression. Too often sinister threats to the Bill of Rights, to the freedom of the mind, are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti-communism." [...] What has changed now, he argues, is that the cloak has morphed into anti-terrorism.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Epic and Novel", Bakhtin {{demonstrates}} the novel’s distinct nature by contrasting {{it with the}} epic. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> because it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique {{in that it is}} able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.|$|E

This [...] "ideal average" [...] can serve as a guide to examining the societies <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live...</b> but the two are not the same, something the disciples of the [...] "tendency of the rate of profit to fall" [...] school do not seem to grasp." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Thunderbirds was {{repeated}} on British {{television in the}} early 2000s, the character of Penelope was criticised for smoking, wearing furs and neglecting to wear a seat belt while being driven in FAB 1. Anderson comments that the smoking habit and fur-wearing especially {{are likely to be}} viewed by modern audiences as politically incorrect, stating that they are two of several [...] "stereotyped prejudices" [...] in Thunderbirds. She adds: [...] "We were limited by the age <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived,</b> and although <b>we</b> prided ourselves on setting new boundaries, I suppose we were too obsessed with the Space Age, nuclear power and their consequences to be more aware of green and other, more down-to-earth issues." ...|$|R

2500|$|John Kieschnick {{wrote in}} Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies that Teiser {{in these three}} monographs {{counters}} the modernist tendency in present day Asian Buddhism to emphasize a [...] "this-worldly" [...] social engagement {{as well as the}} Western tendency to use Buddhist practices for self-cultivation and internal experiences. Teiser's point, says Keischnick, is that historically and perhaps even among most Buddhists today, Buddhism was not a practical guide but a [...] "framework for understanding and negotiating a cosmos that extends far beyond the visible world <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and far beyond the present, to include future and past lives as gods, ghosts, hell beings, and animals, as well as humans." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{publication}} in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. [...] Catch-22 seemed {{to embody the}} feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States.

2500|$|All My Children creator Agnes Nixon cites that {{scripting}} Bianca as {{a lesbian}} {{was in part}} inspired by Chastity Bono's memoir Family Outing. Nixon explained the feelings she wanted expressed with the character's mother, Erica. She wanted to showcase the thought process and actions [...] "most parents" [...] have upon finding out that their child is gay: [...] "I think the right word for Erica's reaction is denial," [...] said Nixon. [...] "I read Family Outing by Chastity Bono.

And after such talk we would fall upon great pauses of emotional dreaming, and if by chance we passed a girl in a governess cart, or some farmer's daughter walking to the station, we became alertly silent or obstreperously indifferent to her.
