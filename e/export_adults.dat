40|$|Allergic {{diseases}} {{occur in}} most mammals, although some {{species such as}} humans, dogs and horses {{seem to be more}} prone to develop allergies than others. In horses, insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH), an allergic dermatitis caused by bites of midges, and recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), a hyperreactivity to stable born dust and allergens, are the two most prevalent allergic diseases. Allergic diseases involve the interaction of three major factors: (i) genetic constitution, (ii) exposure to allergens, and (iii) a dysregulation of the immune response determined by (i) and (ii). However, other environmental factors such as infectious diseases, contact with endotoxin and degree of infestation with endoparasites have been shown to influence the prevalence of allergic diseases in humans. How these factors may impact upon allergic disease in the horse is unknown at this time. The 3 rd workshop on Allergic Diseases of the Horse, with major sponsorship from the Havemeyer Foundation, was held in Holar, Iceland, in June 2007 and focussed on immunological and genetic aspects of IBH and RAO. This particular venue was chosen because of the prevalence of IBH in exported Icelandic horses. The incidence of IBH is significantly different between Icelandic horses born in Europe or North America and those born in Iceland and <b>exported</b> as <b>adults.</b> Although the genetic factors and allergens are the same, <b>exported</b> <b>adult</b> horses show a greater incidence of IBH.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of the no-take marine reserve at Apo Island, Philippines, to local fishery yield through "spillover" (net <b>export</b> of <b>adult</b> fish) was estimated. Spatial patterns of fishing effort, yield, and catch rates around Apo Island were documented daily in 2003 - 2004. Catch rates were higher near the reserve (by a factor of 1. 1 to 2. 0), but fishing effort was often lowest there. Higher catch rates near the reserve were more likely due to spillover than to low fishing intensity. Lower fishing effort near the reserve {{may have been due}} to 1) weather patterns, 2) traditional importance of other fishing grounds, 3) high variability in catch rates, 4) lower market value of target species, and 5) social pressures.

In order {{to be an effective}} fisheries management tool, it must be shown that MPAs do not simply displace fishing effort, but can actually increase the biomass or density of fish in adjacent fisheries. Net <b>export</b> of <b>adult</b> fish to surrounding waters, termed the spillover effect, is one way MPAs may function to replenish fish stocks. The ability to detect the spillover effect using simple metrics of abundance and biomass for five highly targeted species was tested for an MPA in the US Virgin Islands. Moreover, it is equally important for managers to understand linkages between reef fish biomass patterns and associated habitat at multiple scales. Habitat characteristics that influence distribution patterns of targeted reef fish can be explored through spatial statistics and spatial multivariate models. In this study, the specific aim was to further evaluate seascape and local site habitat metrics to find how spatial scales of habitat composition and configuration can be used together cohesively to understand reef fish distribution patterns. In addition, global and local spatial regression models were compared to determine if there is non-stationarity of ecological processes across management zones. Results of this study reinforce the complexities of fish-habitat interactions, which make detection of spillover difficult using simple metrics. However, using a combination of both multi-scale spatial habitat metrics and local regression methods can aid in MPA management and design...|$|R

When fumigated at 20 °C, Hylastes were not significantly more tolerant than Hylurgus adults. The highest methyl bromide concentration required to control Hylastes adults is much lower than the phytosanitary requirement for export logs to India and China, which requires 120 g/m 3 for 16 h at ≤ 15 °C.

40|$|Spillover, the net <b>export</b> of <b>adult</b> fish, is one {{mechanism}} by which no-take marine reserves may eventually have {{a positive influence on}} adjacent fisheries. Although evidence for spillover has increased recently, mechanisms inducing movement of adult fish from reserve to fished areas are poorly understood. While density-dependent export is a reasonable expectation, given that density of fish targeted by fisheries should increase over time inside well-protected no-take reserves, no study to date has demonstrated development of the process. This study provides evidence consistent with density-dependent export of a planktivorous reef fish, Naso vlamingii, from a small no-take reserve (protected for 20 years) at Apo Island, Philippines. Mean density of N. vlamingii increased threefold inside the reserve between 1983 and 2003. Density approached an asymptote inside the reserve after 15 – 20 years of protection. Modal size in the reserve increased from 35 to 45 cm total length (TL) over 20 years of protection. In addition, both density and modal size increased outside the reserve close to (200 – 300 m), but not farther from (300 – 500 m), the reserve boundary over the 20 years of reserve protection. Movement of adult N. vlamingii across the boundaries of the reserve was rare. Aggressive interactions among adult N. vlamingii were significantly higher (by 3. 7 times) inside than outside the reserve. This suggests that density-dependent interactions were more intense inside the reserve. When interacting adults differed in size, the larger individual usually chased away the smaller one. Furthermore, the mean size of adult fish captured by experimental fishing decreased from 35 -cm TL 50 – 100 m outside the boundary, to 32 -cm TL 250 – 300 m outside the boundary. This represents some of the best evidence available for density-dependent home-range relocation of fish from a no-take reserve...|$|R

Due to over harvesting, increased consumption, and the <b>export</b> of <b>adult</b> oysters to San Francisco Bay, oyster populations declined in the late 1800s and the commercial fishery collapsed. The last known naturally occurring population of Olympia oysters in Netarts was surveyed in 1954. Subsequent field surveys in 1979 and 1992 {{did not find any}} Olympia oysters within the bay. Potential factors preventing population recovery post fishery collapse include: habitat degradation, sedimentation by increased motorized boat use, suffocation by burrowing shrimp, pollution, predation by invasive Japanese oyster drill and parasitism by non-native flat worm After their 1992 survey, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began a large scale restoration attempt in Netarts, setting out 9 million spat between 1993-1998. Olympia oyster populations did not return to historical levels, but surveys in 2004 detected low populations of transplanted oysters in the bay. Anecdotal observations from residents also suggest small pockets of naturally occurring oysters subsist in the southwest corner of the bay. Juvenile oysters planted on adult oyster shell as substrate demonstrated that Olympia oysters can grow and reproduce in the bay. Small scale, investigative restoration projects run by The Nature Conservancy were undertaken in 2005 and 2006 to rebuild populations of Olympia oysters in Netarts Bay by adding shell cultch with set Olympia oysters to the bay in hopes of increasing settlement substrate and broodstock. Early monitoring of these sites found reproductive tissue and brooded larvae in adults and recruitment of larvae on shell substrate, but monitoring of the site ceased in 2007. Restoration interests are driven by culinary interest in Olympia oysters, the potential economic benefits of a commercial fishery, and the significant ecosystem services that Olympia oysters provide, including filtering the water and providing substrate for other organisms.|$|R

In conclusion, visual meat inspection of pigs and cattle will only reduce the confidence in freedom from bTB slightly.

Here we tested whether, in our rabbit HF model, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC 5 was altered either at baseline or in response to endothelin- 1, which would indicate HDAC 5 phosphorylation and transcription effects. The fusion protein HDAC 5 –green fluorescent protein (HDAC 5 -GFP) was more cytosolic in HF myocytes (Fnuc/Fcyto 3. 30. 3 vs 7. 20. 4 in control), and HDAC 5 was more phosphorylated. Despite this baseline cytosolic HDAC 5 shift, endothelin- 1 produced more rapid HDAC 5 -GFP nuclear export in HF versus control myocytes. We also find that PKD and CaMKIIC expression and activation state are increased in both rabbit and human HF. Inhibition of either CaMKII or PKD in HF myocytes partially restored the HDAC 5 -GFP Fnuc/Fcyto toward control, and simultaneous inhibition restored Fnuc/Fcyto to that in control myocytes. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PKD, CaMKIIB, or CaMKIIC reduced baseline HDAC 5 Fnuc/Fcyto in control myocytes (3. 40. 5, 3. 80. 5, and 5. 20. 5, respectively), approaching that seen in HF.

40|$|Marine spatial {{planning}} (MSP) is increasingly utilized to sustainably manage ocean uses. Marine protected areas (MPAs), {{a form of}} spatial management in which parts of the ocean are regulated to fishing, are now a common tool in MSP for conserving marine biodiversity and managing fisheries. However, the use of MPAs in MSP often neglects, or simplifies, the redistribution of fishing and non-fishing activities {{inside and outside of}} MPAs following their implementation. This redistribution of effort can have important implications for effective MSP. Using long-term (14 yr) aerial surveys of boats at the California Channel Islands, we examined the spatial redistribution of fishing and non-fishing activities and their drivers following MPA establishment. Our data represent 6 yr of information before the implementation of an MPA network and 8 yr after implementation. Different types of boats responded in different ways to the closures, ranging from behaviors by commercial dive boats that support the hypothesis of fishing-the-line, to behaviors by urchin, sport fishing, and recreational boats that support the theory of ideal free distribution. Additionally, we found that boats engaged in recreational activities targeted areas that are sheltered from large waves and located near their home ports, while boats engaged in fishing activities also avoided high wave areas but were not constrained by the distance to their home ports. We did not observe the expected pattern of effort concentration near MPA borders for some boat types; this {{can be explained by the}} habitat preference of certain activities (for some activities, the desired habitat attributes are not inside the MPAs), species’ biology (species such as urchins where the MPA benefit would likely come from larval <b>export</b> rather than <b>adult</b> spillover), or policy-infraction avoidance. The diversity of boat responses reveals variance from the usual simplified assumption that all extractive boats respond similarly to MPA establishment. Our work is the first empirical study to analyze the response of both commercial and recreational boats to closure.

40|$|The use of no-take marine {{reserves}} (areas {{closed to}} fishing) as fishery management tools has been advocated considerably {{in the past}} decade. No-take reserves are now often established with an objective of enhancing fisheries. However, the fishery effects of no-take reserves remain controversial. Spillover, or net <b>export</b> of <b>adult</b> biomass, is one potential process of fisheries enhancement by reserves. Few studies have shown convincingly that reserves can develop spillover that benefits local fisheries. The objective of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} predicted patterns and proposed mechanisms of spillover from no-take reserves. The no-take reserves studied were on coral reefs in the Philippines that have been well protected for 15 to 20 years. In the first study, I tested the prediction that gradients of decreasing abundance of target species, from high inside the reserve to low outside, would be present across the boundaries of no-take reserves. Spillover is predicted to produce such patterns. Underwater visual census of fishes was carried out along large transects (each one approximately 1 km long) that crossed the lateral boundaries of each of two no-take reserves and two controls (fished sites) at each of two islands. Patterns of decreasing abundance (density and biomass) of target fishes were found only across one boundary of one no-take reserve, the reserve at Apo Island (Apo Reserve). The patterns of decreasing abundance were limited to within 50 - 200 m of the boundary. Rates of decrease in abundance across the boundary were two to three times greater for sedentary fishes than for vagile fish. This finding is consistent with the expectation that the spatial extent of spillover would vary according to mobility of fishes. The patterns of decreasing abundance of target fishes were probably not due to gradients in habitat. Furthermore, no pattern of decreasing abundance across the boundary was found for fishes not targeted by fisheries. In the second study, I investigated the potential mechanisms inducing movement of a targeted planktivorous reef fish, Naso vlamingii, from Apo Reserve to adjacent fished areas. Repeated underwater visual census at reserve and fished sites suggested that some adults of N. vlamingii could emigrate temporarily from Apo Reserve within the short-term (days). Data from visual census and experimental hook and line fishing suggested that short-term emigration of N. vlamingii is related to movement to feeding areas 150 - 200 m away from reserve boundaries. However, some larger (41 - 45 cm TL) adults probably tend to stay inside the reserve. Experimental hook and line fishing adjacent to the reserve also showed that the mean size of N. vlamingii captured decreased as one mo ved up to 300 m away from the boundaries of Apo Reserve. This pattern may have resulted from density-dependent home range relocation of smaller adult N. vlamingii over the long term. Competitive interactions between adult N. vlamingii were up to twice as frequent, on a per fish basis, inside the reserve than outside. When interacting adults differed in sizes, the larger adult was always observed to chase away the smaller one. The sizes of adults that were chased away (25 - 35 cm TL) were similar to the sizes of those caught by experimental fishing (26 - 38 cm TL). In the third study, I attempted to quantify the contribution of spillover to the yield of the local fishery at Apo Island. Daily fishing effort and yield (biomass and value) of local fishers in relatio n to Apo Reserve were studied for eight months (July 2003 to February 2004) over two monsoonal seasons. Average catch rates and income rates of fishers were found to be highest near the reserve (within 300 m of reserve boundaries). Catch rates near the reserve were higher than in other areas far from the reserve by a factor of 1. 1 to 2. 0, depending on the fishing gear. Moreover, the highest average monthly catch rates were always found near the reserve. These findings are consistent with occasional very large catches near the reserve due to spillover. However, fishing effort was often lowest near Apo Reserve. Furthermore, local fishers seemed to have avoided fishing very close to the reserve (within 100 m of reserve boundaries).

40|$|No–take marine {{reserves}} {{have the}} potential to benefit fished species via the net <b>export</b> of <b>adult</b> fish (spillover) and/or eggs and larvae (recruitment subsidy) of target species from protected to fished areas. Recruitment subsidy from reserves is expected because fisheries generally remove the Big Old Fat Fecund Females (BOFFFs) selectively from a population. BOFFFs are expected to contribute disproportionately to reproductive output of populations by producing relatively better quality eggs, in greater quantities, compared with smaller and younger females. Quantifying the relative contribution of reserves to egg production is a crucial step in evaluating the potential for recruitment subsidy to occur. It is important when assessing any effect of reserves that appropriate spatial scales are used whereby, ideally, multiple reserves within the same ecosystem are assessed. This is important in egg production per unit area (EPUA) calculations because the reproductive dynamics of species that occur across broad spatial ranges often vary at a regional scale due to variation in environmental conditions. Such variation may complicate fisheries management if reserves created with the objective of enhancing EPUA of the target species are placed in areas where reproductive output is naturally limited, or where high adult fish densities represent larval sinks, not larval sources. Furthermore, comparisons of EPUA between fished and reserve reefs may be confounded where reproductive data are collected only from fished areas, thereby ignoring potential fishing-related effects such as density-dependent reproduction, Allee-type depensation, altered spawning behaviour, and skewed sex ratios for hermaphroditic species. In this thesis, I present extensive information on the reproductive biology of the common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus [Lacépède 1802], on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). P. leopardus is a valuable food fish in the tropics and the major target species of both recreational and commercial line fisheries on the GBR. The species occurs throughout the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) across 14 ° of latitude and is a protogynous hermaphrodite. The objectives of this thesis were to: determine the relationships between maternal traits of P. leopardus and egg quantity and quality; compare these relationships at an appropriate spatial scale; test for the existence of BOFFFs; and estimate EPUA for P. leopardus along the GBR. The GBRMP is an excellent study site as the extensive network of no-take reserves offers access to comparable fished and reserve (protected) reefs. The vast area also allows environmental and fishing pressure influences to be tested on a regional scale. In Chapter 2, I quantify the effects of length and age on the sex ratio, proportion of vitellogenic females, and spawning frequency of P. leopardus on fished and reserve reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR. In Chapter 3, I outline a new method that uses the ratio of the number of migratory nuclei to the number of hydrated oocytes to estimate batch fecundity of P. leopardus. Previous estimates of batch fecundity were biased due to a small sample size, reliant on sampling the few hours prior to dusk spawning when the maximum number of hydrated oocytes is present in the ovary. My new method increases the time during the day over which samples can be collected and, therefore, increases the sample size available and reduces biases in batch fecundity estimates. This method was used in Chapter 4 to quantify the relationships between length, weight and age with batch fecundity of female P. leopardus on fished and reserve reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR. Maternal effects also are widely known to influence egg quality, and therefore the early life history traits of offspring. In Chapter 5, I examined the maternal effects of length, weight, age, and hepatosomatic index with indicators of egg quality (egg size, oil droplet size, total lipid content and lipid classes) for P. leopardus. Chapter 6 combined a 10 -year length-density data set with reproductive data from Chapters 2 – 4 of this thesis to quantify EPUA of P. leopardus in fished and reserve reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR. Despite the broad distribution of P. leopardus along the GBR, reproductive potential of females was maximized in the central section, particularly in the absence of fishing. Length, weight, and age had positive effects on batch fecundity of females from northern and central reefs but negligible effects on spawners from southern reefs. The proportion of vitellogenic females increased with length and age, as did the proportion of males in the population (as expected for a protogyne). However, female-male sex change occurred at smaller sizes and younger ages in the southern GBR, particularly on fished reefs. P. leopardus spawned most frequently on central reserve reefs (every 2. 3 days during the spawning season) and as infrequently as once every 2 – 3 months in the southern GBR regardless of reserve status. No effect of length on spawning frequency was detected. Maternal length and/or weight also had positive effects on indicators of egg quality, including egg size, oil droplet size, and the proportion of long-term storage lipid wax esters within the egg. Large female P. leopardus in the central GBR, therefore, generally produce more eggs, and eggs with enhanced provisioning, providing a potential advantage for larvae during the critical transition to successful exogenous feeding. Male biased sex ratios and low individual female fecundity in the southern GBR limited the reproductive benefits expected from higher population densities or larger fish in reserves. Egg production per unit area was greatest on reserve reefs in the central GBR where on average an estimated 800 000 oocytes 250 m⁻² year⁻¹ were produced, and lowest on southern GBR reefs where average EPUA was approximately 30 000 oocytes 250 m⁻² year⁻ 1. The effect of reef protection on EPUA was inconsistent among regions: EPUA was 180...|$|R
