It is the occurrence of a trough in the ionization in the F2 layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in magnetic latitude. The Earth's magnetic field lines are horizontal at the magnetic equator. Solar heating and tidal oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the <b>E</b> <b>region</b> which, with the horizontal magnetic field, forces ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at ± 20 degrees from the magnetic equator.

From the sequence for the <b>E</b> 1 b <b>region</b> of Ad 12, and the transcription map of the <b>E</b> 1 b <b>region</b> (1, 2, 3, and this paper) the structure and gene organization of the early <b>region</b> <b>E</b> 1 b of Ad 12 DNA were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} the <b>E</b> 1 b <b>region</b> in the non-oncogenic Ad 5 DNA (4, 5).

Subgroup A and B human adenoviruses generally induce sarcomas in {{both male}} and female animals, and the gene products encoded within viral early <b>region</b> 1 (<b>E</b> 1 <b>region)</b> are both necessary and sufficient for this tumorigenicity. In contrast, subgroup D human adenovirus type 9 (Ad 9) induces estrogen-dependent mammary tumors in female rats and requires the E 4 region-encoded ORF 1 oncoprotein for its tumorigenicity. Considering the established importance of the viral <b>E</b> 1 <b>region</b> for tumorigenesis by adenoviruses, we investigated whether this viral transcription unit is also necessary for Ad 9 to generate mammary tumors. The nucleotide sequence of the Ad 9 <b>E</b> 1 <b>region</b> indicated that the gene organization and predicted E 1 A and E 1 B polypeptides of Ad 9 are closely related to those of other human adenovirus <b>E</b> 1 <b>regions.</b> In addition, an Ad 9 <b>E</b> 1 <b>region</b> plasmid demonstrated focus-forming activity in both low-passage-number and established rat embryo fibroblasts, whereas a large deletion within either the E 1 A or E 1 B gene of this plasmid diminished transforming activity. Surprisingly, we found that introducing the same transformation-inactivating E 1 A and E 1 B deletions into Ad 9 results in mutant viruses that retain the ability to elicit mammary tumors in rats.

40|$|Understanding of the {{structure}} and the origin of genetic variation patterns in the laboratory inbred mouse provides insight into {{the utility of the}} mouse model for studying human complex diseases and strategies for disease gene mapping. In order to address this issue, we have constructed a multistrain, high-resolution haplotype map for the 99 -Mb mouse Chromosome 16 using ∼ 70, 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from whole-genome shotgun sequencing of five laboratory inbred strains. We discovered that large polymorphic blocks (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> where only two haplotypes, thus one SNP conformation, are found in the five strains), large monomorphic blocks (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> where the five strains share the same haplotype), and fragmented blocks (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> of greater complexity not resembling at all the first two categories) span 50 %, 18 %, and 32 % of the chromosome, respectively. The haplotype map has 98 % accuracy in predicting mouse genotypes in two other studies. Its predictions are also confirmed by experimental results obtained from resequencing of 40 -kb genomic sequences at 21 distinct genomic loci in 13 laboratory inbred strains and 12 wild-derived strains. We demonstrate that historic recombination, intra-subspecies variations and inter-subspecies variations have all contributed to the formation of the three distinctive genetic signatures. The results suggest that the controlled complexity of the laboratory inbred strains may provide a means for uncovering the biological factors that have shaped genetic variation patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} structure of fibrinogen was considered {{in reference to}} the terminal plasmin-cleavage fragments, D and E. By two independent approaches, a yield of two D and two E fragments was determined and this established the presence of two D and two <b>E</b> <b>regions</b> in each fibrinogen molecule. Immunochemically, it was shown that the expression of native fibrinogen determinants by the D:E complex was fully reconstituted by an equimolar mixture of D and E fragments, while other recombinant ratios failed to yield optimal reconstitution. Utilizing the cleavage-associated neoantigen of fibrinogen, fg-Dneo, as a quantitative immunochemical marker, it was determined that complete digestion of fibrinogen by plasmin yielded two D fragments. Since the D:E complex appeared to consist of an equal number of D and E fragments, the presence of two <b>E</b> <b>regions</b> and two D regions in fibrinogen was indicated. In polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the linear relationship between the concentration of the D or E fragment and its densitometric area in the gel was utilized to quantitate the yield of D and E fragments in terminal digests. The yield of two D and two E fragments was demonstrated and it was also shown that the yield of fragments was independent of the plasmin concentration and of the length of exposure of the D and E fragments to the enzyme. Thus, it appears that fibrinogen is a highly symmetrical molecule consisting of two <b>E</b> <b>regions</b> as well as two D regions...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) {{very high}} {{frequency}} (VHF) coherent scatter radars were used to study field aligned <b>E</b> <b>region</b> ionospheric irregularities. Using two radars with overlapping fields of view, {{it was possible to}} determine the 2D velocity vector of <b>E</b> <b>region</b> ionospheric plasma flow. However, irregularities were only observed when the radar wavevector was perpendicular to the magnetic field in the scattering region. This meant that there was a problem with operating at VHF since VHF frequencies don't allow for very much refraction of the transmitted radar wave vector; thus, the perpendicularity requirement could not be easily met at high latitudes. At HF frequencies, however, refraction of the radar wavevector is greater, and this allows for the perpendicularity requirement to be met at high latitudes. Refraction of radio waves in the ionosphere is a complicated non-linear phenomenon governed by the Appleton-Hartree equation.|$|E
