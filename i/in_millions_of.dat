5|$|Development of {{the project}} was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted <b>in</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006.

5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{confirms that}} the Coleoptera are monophyletic. Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear genes for 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, broke up the Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic. Most extant beetle families appear to have arisen in the Cretaceous. The cladogram is based on McKenna (2015). The number of species in each group (mainly superfamilies) is shown in parentheses, and boldface if over 10,000. English names are given where possible.

5|$|During recurvature, Typhoon Tip passed about 65km (40mi) east of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72km/h (44mph), with gusts to 112km/h (69mph). Sustained wind {{velocities}} in Japan are not known, {{though they}} were estimated at minimal typhoon strength. The passage of the typhoon through the region resulted <b>in</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars in damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44fishermen dead or unaccounted for. A Chinese freighter broke in half {{as a result of}} the typhoon, though its crew of 46 were rescued. The rainfall led to over 600mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of Japan and flooded more than 22,000homes; 42people died throughout the country, with another 71missing and 283injured. River embankments broke in 70 places, destroying 27 bridges, while about 105 dikes were destroyed. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left homeless. Tip destroyed apple, rice, peach and other crops. Five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50-story buildings swayed in the capital, Tokyo. Transportation in the country was disrupted; 200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled. Tip was described as the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.|$|E

5|$|After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{came into}} being in 1947 as a {{civilian}} agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position he advised {{on a number of}} nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded. As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race. When the government questioned whether to pursue a crash program to develop an atomic weapon based on nuclear fusion—the hydrogen bomb—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project. He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting <b>in</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> deaths. He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons. He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to tritium production. They were overridden by Truman, who announced a crash program after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James Conant, felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee. They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.|$|E
