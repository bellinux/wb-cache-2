50|$|The {{degree of}} {{compaction}} of a soil can be measured by its <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> γd. When water {{is added to the}} soil, it functions as a softening agent on the soil particles, causing them to slide between one another more easily. At first, the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> after compaction increases as the moisture content (ω) increases, but after the optimum moisture content (ωopt) percentage is exceeded, any added water will result in a reduction in <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> because the pore water pressure (pressure of water in-between each soil particle) will be pushing the soil particles apart, decreasing the friction between them.|$|E

5000|$|The Optimum Water Content of soil is {{the water}} content {{at which a}} maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> can be {{achieved}} after a given compaction effort. A max <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> would have no voids in the soil. If {{you were trying to}} compact a hard dry soil to make it more dense, you might want to get it wet. The OPT is the water content of the soil in which you could compact it the most. If there is too much water you would have too much pore water pressure during compression to compact any further. If there is too little water the soil would naturally resist compaction via shear strength/friction/effective stress. The determination of the OPT is important because if tillage is carried out on fields that are wetter or drier than the OPT many problems can be caused, including soil structural damage, through the production of large clods, and an increase in the content of readily dispersible clay which is indicative of the soil stability.|$|E

50|$|Soil compactors {{are used}} to perform test methods which cover {{laboratory}} compaction methods {{used to determine the}} relationship between molding water content and <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of soils. Soil placed as engineering fill is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as, shear strength, compressibility, or permeability. In addition, foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties. Laboratory compaction tests provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties, and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved. Test methods such as EN 13286-2, EN 13286-47, ASTM D698, ASTM D1557, AASHTO T99, AASHTO T180, AASHTO T193, BS 1377:4 provide soil compaction testing procedures.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most states}} have {{somewhat}} limited experience to date with flowable fill, nearly all {{states that have}} used the material have thus far indicated satisfactory performance {{with little or no}} problems. Several states have noted that metal or plastic pipes tend to float unless anchored, and some states have reported some resistance {{to the use of the}} material by contractors or engineers. Since flowable fill is normally a comparatively low-strength material, there are no strict quality requirements for fly ash used in flowable fill or controlled low strength material mixtures. Fly ash is well suited for use in flowable fill mixtures. Its fine particle sizing (nonplastic silt) and spherical particle shape enhances mix flowability. Its relatively low <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (usually in the 890 to 1300 kg/m3 (55 to 80 lb/ft3) range) assists in producing a relatively lightweight fill, and its pozzolanic or cementitious properties provide for lower cement requirements than would normally be required to achieve equivalent strengths.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soil type}} - that is, grain-size distributions, {{shape of the}} soil grains, {{specific}} gravity of soil solids, and amount and type of clay minerals, present - has a great influence on the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and optimum moisture content. [...] It also has a great influence on how the materials should be compacted in given situations. Compaction is accomplished by use of heavy equipment. In sands and gravels, the equipment usually vibrates, to cause re-orientation of the soil particles into a denser configuration. In silts and clays, a sheepsfoot roller is frequently used, to create small zones of intense shearing, which drives {{air out of the}} soil. Determination of adequate compaction is done by determining the in-situ density of the soil and comparing it to the maximum density determined by a laboratory test. The most commonly used laboratory test is called the Proctor compaction test and there are two different methods in obtaining the maximum density. They are the standard Proctor and modified Proctor tests; the modified Proctor is more commonly used. For small dams, the standard Proctor may still be the reference.|$|E

The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function.

However, the change in shear wave velocity along the compaction curve is very significant.
