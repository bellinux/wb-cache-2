There are ten residential {{buildings in the}} hostel campus. Boys' blocks are named Purandar, Shivneri, Panhalgad, Torna, Raigad, Pratapgad, Sajjangad, and Vishalgad. For girls, there are two blocks, namely, Jijaoo and Kondhana. Kondhana and Pratapgad are two-storied, Vishalgad & Jijaoo are four storied, and the remaining buildings are three storied. The hostel campus houses about 1064 boys & 422 girl students. A new residential complex for girls has been constructed which started accommodation from the 2012–13 batch. This was constructed keeping in mind, the huge number of the college's girl-students staying outside. Further it comprises the director's residence, hostel office, security room, guest house of three rooms, nine rectors' quarters, a co-operative store, two common rooms for web-connectivity, a medical clinic, a laundry, three common rooms for entertainment, and students' dining rooms. FX Cosmo, Abhiruchi and Fusion and [...] "Aaswad" [...] are the four boys' and Suruchi is the girls' dining room in the hostel campus.

40|$|A {{decline in}} water quality {{attributed}} to excessive inputs of phosphorus {{has been observed}} in Lake Simcoe {{over the past few}} decades. Various studies have estimated that 25 – 50 % of the total phosphorus entering the lake is from atmospheric deposition. Bare soil exposure in the spring due to lack of vegetative cover, along with soil disturbance related to agricultural activities, results in higher susceptibility to wind erosion and dust emission. This study introduces the new concept of Dust Response Units (DRUs), which combine soil type and land use to determine the dust emission susceptibility based on the hourly variation of wind speed and monthly changes in soil cover due to crop growth. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to determine <b>dust</b> emission <b>suppression</b> factors for a combination of 11 different soils and 6 dominant agricultural land uses, totaling 66 different DRUs in the Lake Simcoe airshed. Employing a widely used dust emission model and applying these <b>dust</b> emission <b>suppression</b> factors resulted in the identification of high risk DRUs. Twelve of the potential 66 DRUs were determined to contribute 85 % of the total crop dust emissions within the Lake Simcoe airshed, including sand, loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand soils combined with row crop, mixed, and hay and pasture land management operations. This study demonstrates a new method to map high priority areas for targeted implementation of dust control best management practices that could be useful in agri-cultural areas both within and beyond the Lake Simcoe airshed...|$|R

Smokeless powder as an explosive charge and sodium bicarbonate as a suppressing material were used.

Approximately 1. 75 kg of extinguishing powder was placed in the container. The membrane was ruptured by exploding a specially developed charge located inside a perforated steel combustion chamber and mounted over the suppressing powder surface. The system was triggered by a signal from the protected volume, sent by a pressure transducer or by a photodiode reacting to a developing flame. The investigations into the efficiency of the active explosion suppression system were carried out in the 1. 3 m 3 explosion chamber. The explosion was initiated in a corn starch-air mixture of 0. 2 kg/m 3 concentration, or in a methane-air mixture of 7. 5 % and 8. 5 % CH 4 concentration.

As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off.

50|$|The {{mining method}} is {{open pit mining}} by {{transference}} in which the excavated pit volumes can be subsequently used for waste dumping purposes.With respect to water management, underground water is intercepted {{in some of the}} open pit workings. This water is currently used for <b>dust</b> <b>suppression</b> on the haul roads. Some of this water is also used to augment the water used in the processing plant. Ahead of reusing the water from the pits, the water used in the plant is sourced from the local municipal water supply. The plant design has been modified to recycle as much water as possible. There is no tailings discharge from the process and no tailings dam: all plant waste is dewatered and transported back to the mine waste dumps for disposal. These tailings will be reprocessed in a later phase of the project and used to restore the last pit shell. At the beginning of pits exploitation, topsoil is saved and used in the environmental restoration of filled pits and benches of waste dumps. The environmental restoration is a process that follows the exploitation of the mine.|$|E
5000|$|Total {{water use}} in Namibia was {{estimated}} at 300 million m3 in 2000. The municipal sector including tourism and industry used 73 million m3 (24 percent), while the bulk of water use is for agriculture and livestock. Only 13 million m3 (4 percent) was used in mining at the time, although this amount has increased due {{to the development of}} mining - in particular uranium mining - after 2000. Mining in Namibia makes extensive use of water, which is used for a broad range of activities including in particular mineral processing, but also dust control, slurry transport and the water use of employees. Uranium mining uses large quantities of water for processing using alkali heap leaching. For example, the Trekkopje mine in the Namib desert uses 14 million m3/year of high-quality water that must be free of any salt. Saline water extracted through local wells is used for <b>dust</b> <b>suppression,</b> thus reducing the need for freshwater. Furthermore, some of the wastewater is treated and reused, thus further reducing water demand. Freshwater demand is met from the Erongo desalination plant that also supplies neighboring communities. Since the lifetime of the plant (30 years) is longer than the expected lifetime of the mine (12 years), already when the plant was planned it was expected that it would be taken over by NamWater at the closure of the mine.|$|E
