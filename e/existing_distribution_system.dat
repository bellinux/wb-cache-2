40|$|Large-scale {{integration}} of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) in power systems can cause severe {{issues to the}} <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system,</b> such as branch congestions and significant voltage drops. As a consequence, smart charging strategies are crucial for the secure and reliable operation of the power system. This paper tries to achieve high penetration level of PEVs with the <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> infrastructure by proposing a smart charging algorithm that can optimally utilize the distribution system capacity. Specifically, the paper proposes a max-weight PEV dispatch algorithm to control the PEV charging rates, subject to power system physical limits. The proposed max-weight PEV dispatch algorithm is proved to be throughput optimal under very mild assumptions on the stochastic dynamics in the system. This suggests that the costly distribution system infrastructure upgrade can be avoided, or failing that, at least successfully deferred. The proposed PEV dispatch algorithm is particularly attractive in integrating the renewable energy sources in the distribution system, by successfully absorbing their intermittency.

The distribution system with LVDS results in multiple loads fed from a bulk power transformer resulting in higher regulation in the tail ends. Moreover there {{is an increase in}} the system losses, power factor, voltage profile and performance are affected in the <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Losses in an electrical system should be around 8 to 14 %.

In this work comparative analysis between high voltage distribution system and low voltage distribution system has been done and also payback calculated. the studies were carried out for an <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> This may result in extended lifetime of the equipment and reduction in system loss.

40|$|This {{research}} is to design the Indonesian LPG distribution system through Location-allocation modelling {{taking into account the}} existing facilities. Location-allocation model is developed in fixed charge capacitated location-allocation problem considering transportation and inventory decisions. Multi echelon LPG distribution system is considered to be modelled from regional warehouse to agents. The objective of this {{research is}} to determine the candidate locations of regional warehouses and feeder filling stations optimally and evaluate the implications of the future changes as sensitivity analysis. The optimal result found that the location-allocation model for the proposed distribution system results a better outputs on associated distribution costs than in the <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> The global optimal shows that in the proposed distribution model, total distribution cost from echelon 1 to 4 is lower than in the <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Meanwhile, the service level, which is represented by the percentage of LPG shortage, is also lower, about 28 per cent lower than the <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Four scenarios of different facility location numbers such as 9, 12, 17 and 18 FFSs are applied in the model. It is found that there is a trade-offs between location adjustment, location-allocation costs and service level. Comparing to the optimal results, less number of FFS decreases transportation and inventory cost that leads the decrease of total distribution cost. It is also observed that service level which is represented by the number of LPG shortages in the distribution system elevates as the number of FFS decreases. Furthermore, the implication of increasing demand to the proposed model reveals different results. It is found that the increasing demand which is projected by Pertamina {{for the next four years}} impact significantly on the location-allocation decisions. It is reported that the projected potential FFSs locations and LPG allocation changes as LPG demand increase. As consequences, the associated distribution costs as fixed cost, inventory and transportation cost also increase. The same phenomenon also occurs in the investigation between service level applied in the echelon 4, associated location-allocation costs and LPG shortage in the distribution system. This research also considers direct and indirect distribution system between echelon 2, 3 and 4, in which FFS is not only allowed to supply LPG to FS, but also to agents. The model of this research could contribute for further research in location-allocation problem in term of the hierarchical distribution system and the integration of other logistics aspects into the model...|$|E

Penetration of a DG into an <b>existing</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> has so many impacts on the system, despite the benefits a DG will provide; it has {{a negative impact on}} one of the most important aspects of the system which is the power system protection, and it is a main factor affecting both reliability and stability of the system. DG causes the system to lose its radial power flow, besides the increased fault level of the system caused by the DG. In this thesis, the effect of DG penetration on the short circuit level of the network is investigated through simulating the IEEE 13 bus test feeder using ETAP. The simulation is repeated for nine different cases at which the location of one large DG is changed in six of the cases to study the effect of the distance on the fault level, while the rest of the cases are performed using small decentralised DGs. The result of those three cases at which the DG is decentralised are used to investigate the effect of the generating capacity of the generation unit on the distribution network parameters and on the currents flowing through the laterals of the distribution network.

Transfer of electric energy from the source of generation to the customer via the transmission and distribution networks is accompanied by losses.

Optimal DG placement can improve network performance in terms of better node voltage profiles, reduce flows and system losses and improve power quality and reliability of supply, but inappropriate DG placement may increase system losses and network capital and operating costs [2].

Therefore, future distribution networks with the high DG penetration to be planned and operated in order to improve their efficiency [4].
