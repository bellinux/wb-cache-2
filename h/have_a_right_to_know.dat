He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, {{as they entered the}} United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI. In May 2007, senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public. One of the backers, Senator Ron Wyden said, [...] "The American people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the Central Intelligence Agency was doing in those critical months before 9/11." ...|$|E

2500|$|By May 19, rumors {{were still}} being spread. Many people {{believed}} that the slayer had been caught. Some of them believed he was being held at the Bowie County Jail surrounded by Texas Rangers with submachine guns on their knees. Others believed he was flown to an out-of-town jail. The Gazette and News offices were drowned with phone calls, both local and long distance, inquiring about the apprehension of the killer. [...] "Newspapers Will Tell Public If Killer Is Caught", read one of the sub-headlines of the May 19th edition of Texarkana Gazette. Sheriff Presley declared that innocent people were being accused of being the Phantom and asked the residents to show more consideration for their fellow citizens. Presley stated, [...] "These rumors positively are not true. We can understand why the people believe them. All of us are tense and are hopeful that at any hour officers will announce they have the killer in custody. The people must not become so anxious to rid themselves of the killer, however, that they brand innocent persons as the murderer and believe unfounded stories. The investigating officers have announced that when and if the killer is apprehended or killed the public will be given the full story through the newspapers. We reaffirm this statement. The newspapers are kept posted on developments in the investigation and they will announce all news immediately. We believe that the people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if the killer is caught or killed and we pledge ourselves to let the public have this information." ...|$|E
