5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> {{small pieces of}} clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} the 18th century waffle recipes took on names to {{designate}} their country or region/city of origin – Schwedische Waffeln, Gauffres à l'Allemande and, most famous of all the 18th century varieties, Gauffres à la Flamande, which were first recorded in 1740. These Gauffres à la Flamande (Flemish waffles / Gaufres de Lille) were the first French recipe to use beer yeast, but unlike the Dutch and German yeasted recipes that preceded them, use only <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> over a pound of butter in each batch.

40|$|BackgroundImmunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated food allergy, such as <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> allergy, {{is common}} in young {{children}} (< 3 years old), but not all young children sensitive to <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> present with allergic symptoms. This study investigated the relationship between sensitization to <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> component allergens <b>and</b> clinical manifestations of allergic diseases in young children. MethodsFrom March to December 2010, 2256 children with physician-diagnosed allergic diseases were tested for serum levels of <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> ovalbumin, <b>and</b> ovomucoid-specific IgE in the Pediatric Allergy and Asthma Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Serum was analyzed for specific IgE antibodies to <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> ovalbumin, <b>and</b> ovomucoid by ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden). Allergen-specific IgE levels ≥ 0. 35  kUA/L were defined as positive. ResultsThere was a significantly higher sensitization rate to <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> its components in children aged 2 – 4 years old. The sensitization rate to <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> ovalbumin, <b>and</b> ovomucoid in this age group was 53. 5 %, 48. 3 %, and 37. 2 %, respectively, and the trend of the sensitization decreased with age (p <  0. 001). After adjusting for age, sensitization to <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> ovalbumin was associated with children with dermatitis [egg white: odds ratio (OR)  =  1. 28, 95 % confidence intervals (CI)  =  1. 03 – 1. 58, p <  0. 05; ovalbumin: OR =  1. 30, 95 % CI =  1. 04 – 1. 62, p <  0. 05]. Children with ovomucoid sensitization had no statistically significant risk among different groups in the current study. ConclusionChildren aged 2 – 4 years old have higher sensitivity to <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> ovalbumin, <b>and</b> ovomucoid. Children with <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> ovalbumin sensitization have a higher risk for atopic dermatitis, and ovalbumin has a more important contribution. Furthermore, we suggested that in children with atopic dermatitis, if they are aged 2 – 4 years old <b>and</b> are having <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> ovalbumin sensitization, avoiding eating raw or slightly heated eggs might have a beneficial effect...|$|R

500|$|Vikram {{signed on}} to {{collaborate}} again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012. Following hushed production developments, {{it was revealed that}} the actor would sport four significantly different looks in the film: a body builder, a beast, a model and a hunchback. He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder, sticking to a diet of protein and coffee, to ensure his muscles are defined on screen. Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model, before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback. He changed his physique by eating small meals of <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> apples instead of regular food intakes, while engaging in an intensive weight loss regime to become thin. The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times, while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look. Taking almost three years for production, Vikram described the film [...] "as the toughest he has ever done" [...] and regularly suffered folliculitis {{as a result of the}} prosthetic make-up he had to wear. The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though critics gave Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan, unanimously positive reviews. A critic from Times of India noted [...] "Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured", while The Hindu added his transformation was [...] "laudable", and that [...] "Vikram wins hearts as the earnest-to-boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block, he floors the audience with his performance as Koonan, the deformed hunchback". Similarly Rediff.com noted the actor [...] "is truly impressive and deserves much applause", while Sify.com added he [...] "lived the role". Despite mixed reviews, I performed well at the box office, as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala. He then worked on Vijay Milton's road-thriller, 10 Enradhukulla (2015), which featured him as an unnamed race driver who goes on a road trip through India. Paired opposite Samantha, the film opened to mixed reviews and did not perform well at the box office. A critic from Sify.com however noted Vikram [...] "breathes life to his role and his energy level is highly infectious", adding that [...] "the way he smiles, dances and fight is a treat for his fans". Likewise a critic from The Hindu criticised the film's script adding [...] "it's hard to see Vikram in this fluff". Vikram later appeared in Iru Mugan, a science fiction action film directed by Anand Shankar, featuring him alongside Nayantara and Nithya Menen.|$|E

2500|$|Flemish waffles, or Gaufres à la Flamande, are a {{specialty}} of northern France and portions of western Belgium. The original recipe, published in 1740 by Louis-Auguste de Bourbon in Le Cuisinier Gascon, is as follows: Take [...] "deux litrons" [...] (1.7 liters or 7 cups) of flour and mix it {{in a bowl}} with salt and one ounce of brewer's yeast barm. Moisten it completely with warm milk. Then whisk fifteen <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> add that to the mixture, stirring continuously. Incorporate [...] "un livre" [...] (490 grams or 1.1 pounds) of fresh butter, and let the batter rise. Once the batter has risen, take your heated iron, made expressly for these waffles, and wrap some butter in a cloth and rub {{both sides of the}} iron with it. When the iron is completely heated, make your waffles, but do so gently for fear of burning them. Cooked, take them out, put them on a platter, and serve them with both sugar and orange blossom water on top.|$|E

Specifi c serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E against lysozyme was present at a concentration of 0. 45 kU/L, and no specifi c IgE was found against <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> yolk, ovalbumin, or ovomucoid.

40|$|Cake is {{typically}} made with 4 main ingredients: flour, egg, sugar and margarine. Although cake {{is a traditional}} baking product, the specific functionality of its ingredients is not fully understood. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} my PhD thesis is to gain more insight in the functionality of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> yolk in cake making. Eggs consist of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> yolk <b>and</b> the shell. <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> contains a lot of water (88 %) and proteins (11 %) and has important foaming and coagulating properties. Egg yolk contains 50 % water, 33 % lipids and 16 % proteins. Egg yolk has emulsifying and coagulating properties. In order to increase the insight, first, the contribution of the different protein fractions (<b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> <b>egg</b> yolk <b>and</b> wheat flour) to the protein network formation is studied. Therefore, 15 N-labelled eggs are used in cake making and the extractability of proteins in different media is evaluated during baking. Secondly, egg yolk is fractionated into plasma and granules.
