40|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> in Danish food {{animal production}} was discontinued in 1998. Contrary to concerns that pathogen load would increase; {{we found a}} significant decrease in Salmonella in broilers, swine, pork, and chicken meat and no change in the prevalence of Campylobacter in broilers. Antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> are antimicrobial drugs added to animal feed to enhance growth and improve feed efficiency of food animals. In the United States, the use of antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> also includes elements of prophylaxis, which are not allowed in Europe. Antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> have been widely used in Danish food animal production since the 1970 s. On February 15, 1998, the Danish cattle and broiler industries, reacting to consumer concerns over food safety, voluntarily stopped the use of all antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters.</b> The pig industry stopped using the <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> in pigs over 35 kg; all use was phased out in 1999. Despite concerns that no longer using the <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> would have a wide range of negative effects (e. g., an increase in disease and death, poor growth rates, increased feed consumption, increased fecal shedding, and enhanced shedding or carriage of foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella or Campylobacter), producers in the broiler and pig industries discontinued the use. Studies have shown that antimicrobial drugs reduce part of the intestinal flora while potentially decreasing pathogen shedding (1 – 3). For these reasons, producers believed that removing antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> could cause human pathogenic intestinal bacteria in food animals to increase. Another concern was that increased fecal shedding could lead to contamination of carcasses at slaughter and increased risk for foodborne infection in humans. Our study examines the effect of discontinued use of antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> on the prevalence of Salmonella in Danish broiler flocks, chickens after slaughter, swine herds, and pork end products. We also examine the effect on Campylobacter in Danish broiler flocks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Antibiotic <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> enhance <b>growth</b> {{performance}} and stabilize an animal’s health status (Gustafsonand Bowen, 1997). Since the ban in 2006 of antibiotic <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> in the European Union, {{the search for}} suitable natural alternative to antibiotic <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> with similar beneficial effects has been intensified. Among possible alternatives are phytogenic feed additives (PFA) which may positively affect poultry health and productivity. Many non-therapeutic substitutes (prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics), especially plants extracts {{from a wide variety}} of herbs, spices and derivatives, have already been used as a feed additive in poultry. Recent studies on these compounds have shown some positive effects (antimicrobial, antioxidant and regulator of the gut flora) in poultry production. This indicates that plant extracts can be considered as feed additives in poultry production...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensive}} and inappropriate {{use of antibiotics}} in both medicine and agriculture has selected for antibiotic resistant bacteria that cause severe problems in antibiotic therapy. In animal husbandry, antibiotics are used for therapeutic and preventive treatments of infectious diseases and as <b>growth</b> <b>promoters.</b> In Europe, many antibiotics used as <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> were of the same classes as important antibiotics used in human medicine. The European Union withdrew the authorization {{for the use of}} the major antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> between 1996 and 1999. In 1999 Switzerland decided to ban the use of all antimicrobials as growthpromoting feed additives. The regulations concerning antibiotic use in animal husbandry and the chronological reasons for the ban of antimicrobial <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> are described. This ban led to a decrease of the antibiotic volume deployed in agriculture. This measure helps to reduce the amount of antibiotic resistant bacteria in food-producing animals. However, the use of medicated feed is still a common practice to prevent and to remedy bacterial infections and thus still leads to resistant pathogens. Surveillance programs, single animal treatment, good manufacturing practices and vaccinations are additional measures to be taken to keep the level of resistances in bacteria low...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Growth</b> <b>promoters</b> {{have been}} widely used as a {{strategy}} to improve productivity, and great benefits have been observed throughout the meat production chain. However, the prohibition of <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> in several countries, as well as consumer rejection, has led industry and the academy to search for alternatives. For decades, the inclusion of phytochemicals in animal feed has been proposed as a replacement for traditional <b>growth</b> <b>promoters.</b> However, there are many concerns about the application of phytochemicals and their impact on the various links in the meat production chain (productive performance, carcass and meat quality). Therefore, the effects of these feed additives are reviewed in this article, along with their potential safety and consumer benefits, to understand the current state of their use. In summary, the replacement of traditional <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> in experiments with broilers yielded benefits in all aspects of the meat production chain, such as improvements in productive performance and carcass and meat quality. Although the effects in pigs have been similar to those observed in broilers, fewer studies have been carried out in pigs, and {{there is a need to}} define the types of phytochemicals to be used and the appropriate stages for adding such compounds. In regard to ruminant diets, few studies have been conducted, and their results have been inconclusive. Therefore, it is necessary to propose more in vivo studies to determine other strategies for phytochemical inclusion in the production phases and to select the appropriate types of compounds. It is also necessary to define the variables that will best elucidate the mechanism(s) of action that will enable the future replacement of synthetic <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> with phytochemical feed additives...|$|R
