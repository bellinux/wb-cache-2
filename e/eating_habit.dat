40|$|Background: Mental disorders, {{including}} eating disorders, mostly begin during youth. Moreover, negative {{body image}} {{is found to}} cause unhealthy <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> {{in the context of}} several cross-cultural settings. This study aimed to examine the correlation between health perception and body image with <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> among high school students. Methods: A structured, anonymous questionnaire was distributed to students of a private high school in Bandung, Indonesia in June-October 2014. The questionnaire included questions about health perception, body image, <b>eating</b> <b>habits,</b> body weight and height, and also other demographic parameters. The school was selected as the study object through purposive sampling, and 140 high school students (72 male and 68 female) were ramdomly selected. Results: Male and female did not show considerable differences in health perceptions. Out of 13 statements, 12 statements of male respondents showed better body image than female. While in <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> statements, female respondents seemed to maintain healthier <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> than male respondents. No significant correlation was observed between body image and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> (r=- 0. 015, p= 0. 858). There was significant correlation between health perception and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> (r= 0. 374, p< 0. 001). Correlation between sex and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> was found (p= 0. 020), there was not significant relationship between <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p= 0. 368). Conclusions: The negative relationship between body image and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> is not significant. However there was a significant positive relationship between health perception and <b>eating</b> <b>habits.</b> Furthermore, there was correlation between sex and <b>eating</b> <b>habits,</b> while the positive relationship between <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> and BMI was still not found...|$|R

Sattvic diet is a diet based on foods in Ayurveda and Yoga literature that contain sattva quality (guna). In this system of dietary classification, foods that harm the mind or body are considered Tamasic, while those that are neither positive or negative are considered Rajasic.

Theoretical principles and practical applications of cognitive-behaviour therapy and hypnotherapy were analysed and used as a foundation for the development of the intervention programme. The researcher developed an Interactionism Model of Self-concept and Eating habits and a Psycho-educational programme involving cognitive-behaviour therapy and hypnotherapy to improve <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> of adolescents. Valid and reliable measuring instruments were used in order to measure self-concept and <b>eating</b> <b>habits.</b> A pre-test post-test design was implemented to nine participants using the Adolescent Self-concept Scale (ASCS), Eating Habits Questionnaire for Adolescents (EHQA) developed by the researcher (2001) and Body Mass Index (BMI). Diagnostic measuring instruments also included the Emotions Profile Index (EPI), Draw A Person (DAP), Sentence Completion, Dietary Record and interview. Results from the empirical study indicated that adolescents with low self-concept and unhealthy <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> responded positively to the Psycho-educational programme involving cognitive-behaviour and hypnotherapy. Specifically, there was a significant increase in selfconcept and a satisfactory improvement in <b>eating</b> <b>habits.</b> Recommendations for psychotherapy practice, educators and parents were made, based on the current research results.

5000|$|The Callorhinchidae (sometimes spelled [...] "Callorhynchidae"), or plough-nose chimaeras, are {{a family}} of marine fish {{containing}} one genus, Callorhinchus. They are similar in form and habits to other chimaeras, but are distinguished {{by the presence of}} an elongated, flexible, fleshy snout, with a vague resemblance to a ploughshare. The snout is used to probe the sea bottom in search of the invertebrates and small fishes on which it preys. The remainder of the body is flat and compressed, often described as elongated. The mouth is just under this snout and the eyes are located high on top of the head. The usual color is black or brown, and, often a mixture between the two. Phylogenetically, they are the oldest group of living jawed Chondrichthyes. They possess the same cartilaginous skeleton seen in sharks but are considered holocephali to distinguish them from the shark and ray categorization. Because of this, they provide a useful research organism for studying the early development of the jawed characteristic. Among the Chondrichthyes genome, Callorhinchus has the smallest genome. Because of this, it has been proposed to be used for entire genome sequencing to represent the cartilaginous fish class. They are considered to resemble a cross between a shark and a ray or skate, but can be distinguished from sharks because they possess an operculum over their gill slits. Additionally, their skin is smooth, not covered in tough scales, characteristic of the shark. While the shark's jaw is loosely attached to the skull, the Callorhinchidae family differ in that their jaws are fused to their skulls. Many classify the Callorhinchidae as a chimeric species due to their shared characteristics of both the sharks and rays. They are found in muddy and sandy substrates of the ocean bottom, where they filter feed, with small shellfish making up the bulk of their diet. They have broad flat teeth that have adapted for this type of <b>eating</b> <b>habit,</b> two pair that reside in the upper jaw and one pair in the lower jaw. In addition to its utilization for feeding, the trunk of the Callorhinchus fish can sense movement and electric fields, allowing them to locate their prey. [...] They possess large pectoral fins, believed to aid in moving swiftly through the water. They also have two dorsal fins spaced widely apart, which help identify the species in the open ocean.|$|E
50|$|In a port town pub, {{the once}} again flat broke Straw Hats witness a {{suspicious}} exchange between a customer and the proprietor. Nami immediately senses money and endeavors {{to convince the}} host to give her whatever information he had given him. The other Straw Hats join in and soon he is persuaded. He shows them to a backdoor, behind which they find a long and winding tunnel. That tunnel leads to a large underground chamber, where a number of pirate crews have a gathering. The island they are on, {{turns out to be}} the starting point of an irregularly occurring, anything-goes sailing competition. For a moment, the Straw Hats weigh whether it is wise to join in the race, considering that two giants and a crew of fish-men, who were once the rivals of Arlong's gang, were participating as well. But once they learn the height of the price money, not entering is out of the question. From the bookmaker they receive an eternal pose, to lead them to the goal of the race. Free food is available at the bottom of the chamber and Luffy makes extensive use of it. His <b>eating</b> <b>habit</b> of stealing other people's food quickly angers the bounty hunter Shuraiya Bascùd (Shuraiya Basukūdo), as well as a group of men led by Gasparde (Gasupāde). Gasparde is a deserted naval officer, with a bounty more than three times as high as Luffy's and said to be the race's favorite. A fight arises, and after Luffy and Shuraiya beat up his men, they find themselves standing before the general himself. He is impressed with their skill and offers both of them to work under him. Of course they refuse, but Luffy finds some insulting words to do it and is caught off guard by Gasparde's right-hand man, Needles. Luffy's courage impresses Gasparde even more. He renews his offer, orders Needles to let go of the rookie pirate, and leaves the room. The next morning, a strong ocean current starts the race, by pushing the ships upstream over the island. As soon as they are over the top, the various crews start shooting broadsides, board each other's ships, and ram their competitors out of the water. But once the island is left behind, the field quickly clears up, leaving the Straw Hats time to eat. While inspecting the ship, Zoro discovers a boy named Anaguma (アナグマ), who had stowed away to earn money by killing some pirate to buy medicine for his adoptive grandfather, who works as an engineer on Gasparde's partially steam powered ship. The race continues. After fighting yet another rival crew and an encounter with a group of large sea kings, they arrive at the island the eternal pose is pointing to. The eternal poses were all mislabeled and led the fleet of unsuspecting pirates into reach of the cannons of the navy stronghold Navarone. Luffy has no doubt to whose fault it is. They turn around and using Choppers fine nose, attempt to catch up with Gasparde's ship. Shuraiya, who had followed Gasparde's invitation to come along on his ship, turns against him to take revenge for Gasparde's killing his parents and sister. He fights Needles and throws him over board, but stands no chance against Gasparde's Logia-type powers, which allow him to turn parts or all of his body into liquid or solid candy. The general is about to kill the bounty hunter, when the Straw Hats arrive and catch his attention. Luffy confronts him and the two engage in a fierce but one-sided battle. Any attack Luffy throws at his opponent causes his limbs to get stuck in Gasparde's body. Only after Sanji gives two sacks of flour to Luffy, can he overcome the villain's ability. Anaguma turns out to be a girl and Shuraiya's thought-dead sister, Adele Bascùd (Aderu Basukūdo). With all their competitors taken out, the Straw Hats are about to arrive at the goal of the race, when a fleet of navy ships appears and forces them to abandon their prize money.|$|E

School meals in Slovenia are well organised {{and at least one}} meal is provided to children and students during school. The aim of our thesis was to analyse <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> of secondary school students during school, their attitude towards school meals and the impact of abolishment of subsidized meals on students’ <b>eating</b> <b>habits.</b> A descriptive method was used to gather the necessary data. Data were collected from a questionnaire with questions about socio-demographic characteristics of interviewees, their <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> and their attitude towards eating and school meals. Our study included 289 secondary school students. Our results demonstrate that Slovenian adolescents have poor <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> even though they should have the correct nutrition of the highest quality. They consume too much sweets and sweet drinks and too little fruits and vegetables. Our results also show that 57, 8 % of interviewed students consume school meals less often compared to last year. Students agree the school meals are too expensive and they wish they were subsidized. Positive influence on students’ <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> could be achieved by providing an adequate subsidy and by addressing issues regarding provision of suitable school meals...|$|R
