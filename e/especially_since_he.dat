5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for {{her marriage to}} Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, {{who had come to}} see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Taft made six {{appointments}} to the Supreme Court, {{the most of}} any president except George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The death of Justice Rufus Peckham in October 1909 gave Taft his first opportunity. He chose an old friend and colleague from the Sixth Circuit, Horace H. Lurton of Georgia; he had in vain urged Theodore Roosevelt to appoint Lurton to the high court. Attorney General Wickersham objected that Lurton, a former Confederate soldier and a Democrat, was aged 65. Taft named Lurton anyway on December 13, 1909, and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote a week later. Lurton is still the oldest person to be made an associate justice. Lurie suggested that Taft, already beset by the tariff and conservation controversies, desired to perform an official act which gave him pleasure, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> thought Lurton deserved it.|$|E

5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 {{to cut back}} on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of the}} relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more fuel-efficient, jet engine into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 turbojets for the turboprops. The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the jet engine had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E
5|$|To {{understand}} why the Chinese made such reports, Waley explained that any military action, whether successful or not, {{was followed by a}} scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they had in mind. Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the fabrications, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese. This was {{the first in a series}} of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war. The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.|$|E

25|$|The first β-sheet {{structure}} was proposed by William Astbury in the 1930s. He proposed {{the idea of}} hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds of parallel or antiparallel extended β-strands. However, Astbury {{did not have the}} necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> did not then know that the peptide bond was planar. A refined version was proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. Their model incorporated the planarity of the peptide bond which they previously explained as resulting from keto-enol tautomerization.|$|E

25|$|Lead guitarist Jerry Garcia {{was often}} viewed {{both by the}} public and the media as the leader or primary {{spokesperson}} for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> and the other group members saw themselves as equal participants and contributors to their collective musical and creative output. Garcia, a native of San Francisco, grew up in the Excelsior District. One of his main influences was bluegrass music, and he also performed—on banjo, one of his other great instrumental loves, along with the pedal steel guitar—in bluegrass bands, notably Old and in the Way with mandolinist David Grisman.|$|E
25|$|After the 1952 season, Veeck {{suggested}} that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis. A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, {{he was forced to}} put the Cardinals up for sale. Most of the bids came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could even begin to match, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to leave St. Louis and find another place to play. As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals.|$|E

Which present-day formal theories can 'mimic' those contentual proofs, without violating Goedel's theorem on consistency proofs?

25|$|Although many viewers {{assume the}} wife to be pregnant, {{this is not}} {{believed}} to be so. Art historians point to numerous paintings of female virgin saints similarly dressed, and believe that this look was fashionable for women's dresses at the time. Fashion would have been important to Arnolfini, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was a cloth merchant. The more cloth a person wore, the more wealthy {{he or she was}} assumed to be. Another indication that the woman is not pregnant is that Giovanna Cenami (the identification of the woman according to most earlier scholars) died childless, as did Costanza Trenta (a possible identification according to recent archival evidence); whether a hypothetical unsuccessful pregnancy would have been left recorded in a portrait is questionable, although if it is indeed Constanza Trenta, as Koster proposed, and she died in childbirth, then the oblique reference to pregnancy gains strength. Moreover, the beauty ideal embodied in contemporary female portraits and clothing rest in the first place on the high valuation on the ability of women to bear children. Harbison maintains her gesture is merely an indication of the extreme desire of the couple shown for fertility and progeny.|$|E

500|$|A {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} first part is the changing nature of violinist’s lives during Szigeti’s later years. In his youth, concert artists relied primarily on recitals to establish themselves and attract critical attention and acclaim; by the time of Szigeti’s writings, the recital had been eclipsed in importance by the competition. Szigeti was dismayed by this trend, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> considered the fast-paced and intense preparation necessary for high-level competitions to be [...] "…incompatible with the slow maturing either of the performing artist or of the repertoire." ...|$|E

He tries to apologize, saying he has been {{under a lot of pressure}} and she tells him he now has one less thing to worry about since she’s intending to cancel the wedding. He says it’s too late to cancel but she responds that it’s “just in the nick of time”. The next morning Milton shows up early on her doorstep to apologize. She tells him it’s not his fault and he insists it is, since Victor has always been desperate for his father’s approval, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he’s</b> never gotten it. She wonders why she should marry a man who values his father’s opinion more than hers. Milton tells her that after she left, Victor called him up and “tore him a new one” and blamed him for driving her away. Just then Victor arrives with roses and Milton sneaks out the back. He looks on approvingly as Victor and Gabrielle embrace.|$|R

500|$|Marshall then {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issues, {{and the argument}} of the Solicitor General that {{the section of the}} Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied. [...] First, Marshall noted that the case history of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement, not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint. [...] He saw of no reason to begin now, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> did not find that the tribe's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce.

Mitsuda worked closely with Masato Kato, the event planner and script writer of Xenogears, to compose the score. Mitsuda considered it hard at times to maintain his motivation throughout the whole two-year period, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had to wait for the end to see the most dramatic tracks implemented. The game's director Tetsuya Takahashi did not initially think [...] "music was all that important" [...] compared to graphics, but eventually acknowledged its importance when he realized it could strongly enhance the expressivity of the images.
