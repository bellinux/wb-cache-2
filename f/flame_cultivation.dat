40|$|Weed {{control has}} been one of the major {{problems}} in the culture of castorbeans (Ricinus communis L.) Many acres of castorbeans are annually abandoned or replanted due to severe weed infestations. Castorbeans ordinarily do not emerge for two to three weeks, which allows weed seedlings to become well established before castorbeans are competitive. Current methods of weed control in castorbeans include cultivation, rotary hoeing, preemergence herbicides, and hand hoeing. However, hand hoeing is very expensive and other methods are extremely dependent on weather conditions. Existing methods should be improved and new methods introduced to aid in the overall weed control program for castorbeans. <b>Flame</b> <b>cultivation</b> is a possible weed control aid for castorbeans. In order to gain more knowledge about <b>flame</b> <b>cultivation,</b> laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies were initiated. Advisor: Orvin C. Burnsid...|$|E
40|$|Flame weedinga type {{of thermal}} weed controlwas {{commonly}} used in row crops like cotton and sorghum from the late 1930 s until the mid- 1960 s, when selective herbicides became widely available. In the 1980 s and 90 s, flame weeding made a rapid comeback as a non-chemical weed control tech-nique, especially among organic farm-ers. Flame weeding, also called <b>flame</b> <b>cultivation,</b> relies on propane gas burn-ers to produce a carefully controlled and directed flame that briefly passes over the weeds.

40|$|Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is a woody {{perennial}} crop that can remain productive for decades. Competition for resources between cranberries and weeds can depress cranberry farm yields, resulting in large annual crop losses. Renewed interest in reducing chemical inputs into cranberry systems {{has provided the}} motivation to evaluate methods, such as <b>flame</b> <b>cultivation</b> (FC), as potential nonchemical options for weed control. Also known as thermal weeding, FC exposes plants to brief periods of high temperature that causes {{the water in the}} plant tissue to expand rapidly, rupturing plant cells and leading to necrosis. Various FC methods have been used successfully in annual crops as both a preemergence and postemergence weed control, but few scientific reports have been published on the use of FC on perennial weeds in a {{woody perennial}} crop system. Dewberry (Rubus spp.), sawbrier (Smilax glauca), and common rush (Juncus effusus) are cranberry weeds that are difficult to control, spread quickly and can cause significant crop loss. <b>Flame</b> <b>cultivation</b> may be an effective non-chemical means for controlling these weeds in cranberry systems. FC would ideally be used as a spot treatment for weeds growing in the cranberry canopy, as well as on larger non-production areas where cranberry vines are not as abundant, such as bog edges, ditches, and dikes. Using FC to treat weeds within the cranberry canopy will likely cause localized damage to cranberry plants immediately surrounding the weeds, thus cranberry response to FC is also of interest. The following experiments were designed to examine the response of weeds and cranberry plants to FC. Perennial plants rely on reserves of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) for growth and survival, thus the efficacy of FC treatments to weeds will likely be impacted by the timing and frequency of treatments as they relate to the specific carbohydrate cycles of targeted weeds, such as dewberry. An additional experiment studied the seasonal fluctuations of NSC in dewberry roots. Cranberry growers were also surveyed on their past experiences with FC, as well as their willingness to adopt FC if proven an effective method for controlling weeds. ...|$|E
40|$|Local soils were {{continuously}} {{tainted by}} toxicants. Mycoremediation {{was a new}} technology for the reduction of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons. In general, this study aimed {{to determine whether the}} local mushrooms, namely, Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Singer, Agaricus bisporus (J. E. Lange) Imbach and Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm., can take up the toxicants present in the soil from chosen sites. Specifically, this study aimed to correlate if the inherent varying conditions, namely, temperature, pH, and moisture of the soil affect the concentration of toxicants in the chosen sites. It also aimed to determine which soil-polluted site has the highest concentration of environmental pollutants and determine which Philippine mushroom is a better agent for the removal of environmental contaminants/pollutants. Heavy metals, namely, cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn), were among the trace elements commonly used by vast industries that mainly contribute to environmental pollution. Philippine mushrooms, namely, Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Singer, Agaricus bisporus (J. E. Lange) Imbach, and Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm., were selected in this study due to cost-effectiveness and ease in native <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Flame</b> Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and Column Chromatography were used for economical determination of toxicants. The main result of the study revealed that Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm. had almost comparable chelating strength to EDTA. Two-way ANOVA with interaction showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between variation in local mushrooms at different strengths and their interaction with varying concentrations of soil samples. Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm. showed to the best biosorbent in both active and passive biosorption mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Flaming is {{a thermal}} weed control method that can kill weeds within or between crop rows using heat. Mechanical {{cultivation}} is another weed control method which undercuts weeds between crop rows to kill them. A combination flamer/cultivator implement {{was designed to}} take advantage of the good qualities of both flaming and cultivation to provide excellent organic weed control. Flaming hoods were designed in the spring of 2010 and retrofitted on an existing row crop cultivator. The hoods were tested in corn and soybean field studies in the summer of 2010. Of the seven treatments tested, a treatment of flaming combined with cultivation applied twice during a season produced the highest weed control and crop yield, while maintaining low crop injury and weed dry matter. The flaming hoods were redesigned in the spring of 2011 to be easier to manufacture. New torches were developed to replace the commercial torches previously used. A flow mixer enhanced heat transfer by reducing or eliminating film evaporation. Reducing the primary air intake decreased flame liftoff length and improved stability. The new hoods and torches were tested in the same seven field treatments during the summer of 2011. <b>Flaming</b> combined with <b>cultivation</b> twice performed best overall again, although the actual values of the performance parameters were lower than in 2010. There are several factors which may have caused worse results in 2011 than in 2010. These include changes in weed composition and density, equipment, climate, and planting date. Gas temperature measurements were conducted on three of the hood/torch configurations used in the field studies, as well as on open, unhooded torches. Thermocouple heat losses due to radiation were accounted for, and ranged from 0. 9 percent to 29. 4 percent. The hooded torches were far superior to the open torches, increasing the high-temperature region length by approximately 200 mm. The 2010 hood provided temperatures that were 36 percent higher at the hottest cross-section than the 2011 hood, but the latter performed better overall. Adviser: George Gogo...|$|R
6000|$|Little {{as such a}} view {{might have}} lent itself to application, my brother's searching {{discovery}} {{during the summer of}} 1861 that his vocation was not [...] "after all" [...] in the least satisfyingly for Art, took on as a prompt sequel the recognition that it was quite positively and before everything for Science, physical Science, strenuous Science in all its exactitude; with the opportunity again forthcoming to put his freshness of faith to the test. I had presumed to rejoice before at his adoption of the studio life, that offering as well possible contacts for myself; and yet I recall no pang for his tergiversation, there being nothing he mightn't have done at this or at any other moment that I shouldn't have felt as inevitable and found in my sense of his previous age some happy and striking symptom or pledge of. As certain as that he had been all the while [...] "artistic" [...] did it thus appear that he had been at the same time quite otherwise inquiring too--addicted to [...] "experiments" [...] and the consumption of chemicals, the transfusion of mysterious liquids from glass to glass under exposure to lambent <b>flame,</b> the <b>cultivation</b> of stained fingers, the establishment and the transport, in our wanderings, of galvanic batteries, the administration to all he could persuade of electric shocks, the maintenance of marine animals in splashy aquaria, the practice of photography in the room I for a while shared with him at Boulogne, with every stern reality of big cumbrous camera, prolonged exposure, exposure mostly of myself, darkened development, also interminable, and ubiquitous brown blot. Then there had been also the constant, as I fearfully felt it, the finely speculative and boldly disinterested absorption of curious drugs. No livelier remembrance have I of our early years together than this inveteracy, often appalling to a nature so incurious as mine in that direction, of his interest in the [...] "queer" [...] or the incalculable effects of things. There was apparently for him no possible effect whatever that mightn't be more or less rejoiced in as such--all exclusive of its relation to other things than merely knowing. There recurs to me withal the shamelessness of my own indifference--at which I also, none the less, I think, wondered a little; as if by so much as it hadn't been given me to care for visibly provoked or engineered phenomena, by that same amount was I open to those of the mysteriously or insidiously aggressive, the ambushed or suffered sort. Vivid to me in any case is still the sense of how quite shiningly light, as an activity and an appeal, he had seemed to make everything he gave himself to; so that at first, until the freshness of it failed, he flung this iridescent mantle of interest over the then so grey and scant little scene of the Harvard (the Lawrence) Scientific School, where {{in the course of the}} months I had had a glimpse or two of him at work. Early in the autumn of 1861 he went up from Newport to Cambridge to enter that institution; in which thin current rather than in the ostensibly more ample began to flow his long connection with Harvard, gathering in time so many affluents. His letters from Cambridge during the next couple of years, many of them before me now, breathe, I think, all the experience the conditions could have begotten at the best; they mark the beginning of those vivacities and varieties of intellectual and moral reaction which were for the rest of his life to be the more immeasurably candid and vivid, the more numerous above all, and the more interesting and amusing, the closer view one had of him. That of a certainty; yet these familiar pages of youth testify most of all for me perhaps to the forces of amenity and spontaneity, the happy working of all relations, in our family life. In such parts of them as I may cite this will shine sufficiently through--and I shall take for granted thus the interest of small matters that have perhaps but that reflected light to show. It is in a letter to myself, of that September, dated [...] "Drear and Chill Abode," [...] that he appears to have celebrated the first steps of his initiation.|$|R
