5|$|The <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and {{the space}} group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice {{constants}} are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E

The grain transfer and the grain mobility transitions are introduced qualitatively, but explicitly.

Hexagons are obtained when a high-mobility condition and a low-mobility condition are alternately applied. We discuss this hexagon formation {{in connection with}} the formation of squares and stripes.

25|$|Most {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} silica {{are made of}} infinite arrangements of {SiO4} tetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken {{to allow for the}} arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure.</b> This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and vitrification, or the formation of a glass, is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550°C) or β-tridymite (1703°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes, forming glassy lechatelierite. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide (SiS2) and silicon diselenide (SiSe2): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.|$|E

500|$|The cyclol {{model was}} {{consistent}} with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins. [...] (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4 g/mL) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply regular packing. [...] (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, consistent with the idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association. [...] (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was plausible to assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry. [...] (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple chemical explanation of denaturation and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins. [...] Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the Watson-Francis Crick concept of DNA templating its own replication. [...] Given that many biological molecules such as sugars and sterols have a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure,</b> it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] Wrinch summarized her model and the supporting molecular-weight experimental data in three review articles.|$|E
