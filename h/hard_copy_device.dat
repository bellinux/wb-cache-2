AN/FYA-3 didn't have a <b>Hard</b> <b>Copy</b> <b>Device</b> (HC) for the Multicolored Display (MC), nor a Console Printer (CP); while the AN/FYA-4 only had an Electronic Typewriter/Display (RT) and CP. The console {{was run by}} a Monitor Program in the DPSS, and [...] "operational capabilities were exercised via operational capability overlays; that is, via plastic masks fitting over the logic keyboard portion of the operator console." [...] The original COC plan was for DPSS output for 11 MCs and 15 CPs (i.e., 4 of the simplest AN/FYA-4 consoles for printing reports).|$|E

The Clinical Data System consists of a graphics computer, a paper tape reader, a <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>device</b> and requisite software. The system can accept data from both Beta and Gamma scintillation counters. The system does RIA data reduction, quality control, and scatchard analysis. Results can be viewed in linear, semi-log or full logarithmic form. The Clinical Data System increases efficiency in the lab while reducing errors and improving quality control...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} quality control (QC) is to detect {{changes in the}} {{performance}} of a gamma camera system that may adversely affect the interpretation of clinical studies. Clearly, there are a large number of factors that contribute to the final image quality, including uniformity, resolution (both intrinsic and energy), collimation and the <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, for certain types of studies, other factors such as count rate capability come into play. With the addition of tomographic imaging, comes an additional suite of parameters that can influence the clinical images- these include system center of rotation, gantry and collimator hole alignment, rotational stability of the detector head and the integrity of the reconstruction algorithms. On a day-to-day basis, there is a limited amount of time that can be reasonably devoted to system QC. Hence the main goal of a QC program should be to monitor those parameters that are a) most sensitive to changes in system performance and b) most likely to impact clinical studies. This review will focus on some of the more critical areas in the quality control of gamma camera systems. QC of Planar Imaging System...|$|E
40|$|Dry imaging {{cameras are}} {{important}} <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>devices</b> in radiology. Using dry imaging camera, multiformat images of digital modalities in radiology are created from a sealed unit of unexposed films. The functioning {{of a modern}} dry camera, involves a blend of concurrent processes, in areas of diverse sciences like computers, mechanics, thermal, optics, electricity and radiography. Broadly, <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>devices</b> are classified as laser and non laser based technology. When compared with the working knowledge and technical awareness of different modalities in radiology, the understanding of a dry imaging camera is often superficial and neglected. To fill this void, this article outlines the key features of a modern dry camera and its important issues that impact radiology workflow...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of methods {{has been conducted}} of the optical techniques of ellipso-polarimetry, and dark field microscopy to determine {{the resolution of the}} spatial variations in thickness within thin films in real time. The ellipso-polarimeter is an adaptation of normal point ellipsometric methods to accommodate assessment of spatial distribution, but unlike the traditional methods, will utilize the image as qualitative information rather than quantitative. This is achieved {{through the use of a}} coherent light source, beam expander, and collimating/focusing optics for the throughput of the system, and the use of a CCD camera to collect the two-dimensional signal for display on a video monitor. The use of the CCD camera allows the collection of data at video rates, thus observation of thickness distribution can be done in 2 ̆ 2 real time 2 ̆ 2, and can be stored as a digital file for archive purposes or output to a <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>device.</b> It is also possible to utilize image processing techniques to extract or enhance information present in the images. The dark field method is also an adaptation from traditional microscopy techniques, and utilizes oblique illumination from a coherent source with on axis optics to collect scattered light and display it as an image on a monitor. It is possible that either of these techniques could be implemented for a quality control application where a deviation in material type or from a desired thickness needs to be recognized either by a human operator or in an automated fashion under computer control, though the type of variation which is to be detected will dictate which method to utilize...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{exchange}} data between colour imaging devices {{through the medium}} of a device-independent colour space, it is necessary to define the relationship between the device colour space and a CIE colour space. For some <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> media it is possible to define the device-CIE relationship by modelling the physical properties of the media, {{as in the case of}} the Kubelka-Munk model, although in practice the relationship is more often defined through a numerical model determined from measurement of a sample of the colours produced by the device. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of recent work on the characterization of <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>devices,</b> and summarizes some recent work completed by the author in the application of polynomial regression and in the area of four-colour devices. It includes the only fully-described example in the literature of a black generation model. The book in which this chapter appears is a collection of recent work contributed by colour imaging researchers. The chapters are based on numerous journal articles and conference papers, and summarise work undertaken over a considerable period of time by the leading experts in each area. It is used a key reference by postgraduate courses and research and development labs throughout the world. Green also contributed two other chapters: ‘Colorimetry and Colour Difference’ and ‘Overview of characterization methods’. The latter chapter introduces the section on characterization methods which includes chapters on each class of devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{and extends}} previous {{work by the}} author in developing systems which provide the user with various forms of explicit and implicit assistance, and in general cooperate with the user {{in the development of}} his programs. The system described in this paper makes extensive use of a bit map display and pointing device (a mouse) to significantly enrich the user's interactions with the system, and to provide capabilities not possible with terminals that essentially emulate <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>devices.</b> For example, any text that is displayed on the screen can be pointed at and treated as input, exactly as though it were typed, i. e., the user can say use this expression or that value, and then simply point. The user views his programming environment through a collection of display windows, each of which corresponds to a different task or context. The user can manipulate the windows, or the contents of a particular window, by a combination of keyboard inputs or pointing operations. The technique of using different windows for different tasks makes it easy for the user to manage several simultaneous tasks and contexts, e. g., defining programs, testing programs, editing, asking the system for assistance, sending and receiving messages, etc and to switch back and forth between these tasks at his convenience...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Colorimetrically {{faithful}} {{color reproduction}} across different media requires accurate mapping between each device specific color {{space and the}} physiological color space of the human observer, standardized by the CIE (1931) colorimetric system [1, 2]. Whereas this kind of color mapping can {{be as easy as}} a linear transformation for three-primary additive displays such as CRTs, it can be far more complicated for <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> output <b>devices</b> and input scanners. We have recently developed various device characterization and color mapping techniques that use nonlinear transformations to convert between CIELAB and the device specific color spaces of scanners and printers [4]. A typical problem arises with scanners for which the spectral sensitivity functions of their three color channels are significantly different from linear combinations of the CIE color-matching functions ¯ x(); ¯ y() ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Color {{matching}} between proofs {{and press}} sheets {{has not been}} a trivial task. Differences in colorants, solid ink density, and dot gain between <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> output <b>devices</b> are some of the reasons that proofs and press sheets don’t match. The Inter-national Color Consortium (ICC) has developed a system-level color management tool which is aimed at improving color rendering between various imaging devices. In this paper, the ICC-based color matching experiments were performed {{with the use of a}} four-color sheet-fed offset press, a film-based color proofer, and a thermal dye transfer process. Specifically, we investigated if ICC-based CMS can help an analog color proofer and a continuous-tone digital color proofer improve its color matching to a reference press sheet. Experimental findings based on observer analysis using rank ordering, and colorimetric analysis between proofs and press sheets were discussed...|$|R
