This paper deals with the selection of the Danish survey <b>and</b> the <b>grossing-up</b> estimation. Focus, however, is on the Danish methods of survey maintenance over the medium term insuring both high total survey coverage and broad coverage in terms of instruments and sectors. Many countries with survey-based systems confront similar challenges and the working paper can hopefully be of inspiration and generate discussion. In the Danish system equity, intercompany debt, etc., loans and deposits, other investments, trade credits and financial derivatives are survey-covered for the sectors non-financial corporations, other financial intermediaries and insurance and pension funds. Using a dynamic register on financial account data and simple statistical methods the survey coverage on equity is maintained <b>and</b> the <b>grossing-up</b> is dynamically re-estimated. For intercompany debt, etc., loans and deposits, and other investments a method has been developed to maintain coverage over time while grossing-up is assumed constant.

40|$|Astoundingly, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) {{does not}} contain [a] {{derogation}} clause. Furthermore, it has been established by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Commission) {{in the case of}} Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme et des Libertes v Chad (Commission Nationale case) that a member state of teh ACHPR cannot derogate human rights in case of emergencies. Hence, the Commission's view may lead to a conclusion that all rights under the ACHPR are non-derogable. This raises the issue of whether it is tenable to conclude that a state facing a situation that endangers the nation, should not at all derogate from the provisions of the ACHPR. Emergency clauses, which permit derogation of human rights in times of emergencies, are also found in most domestic legal instruments. Most African states also encompass this clause in their constitutions. Although the levels of compliance by states are questionable, some of these constitutions also include a list of non-derogable rights. The constitutions of Ethiopia and Mozambique also provide for a <b>derogation</b> clause <b>and</b> a list of non-derogable rights. The aim of the study is to make a critical analysis of the African derogation system. Firstly, the study will analyse the concept of <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights in general. Secondly, the jurisprudence and the law of the African system with regard to <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights will be examined. In analysing the jurisprudence of the Commission effort will be made to critically study the cases that have been examined by the Commission in relation to <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights. Lastly, the compatibility of the Ethiopian and Mozambique constitutions in light of the African system and international standards will be discussed. [...] . Chapter one highlights the basis and structure of the entire study. Chapter two presents a brief historical evolution as well as conceptual framework of the system of <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable human rights in state of emergency. Chapter three focuses on the ACHPR and the jurisprudence of the Commission with regard to <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> non-derogable rights in state of emergency. Chapter four assesses the compatibility of the non-derogable rights provided in the constitutions of African states with African and international standards. This chapter will [analyse], in particular, the constitutions and the practices of Ethiopia and Mozambique. Chapter five is a conclusion of the overall study stating specific recommendations.

40|$|Several {{prominent}} {{human rights}} treaties attempt to minimize violations during emergencies by authorizing states to “derogate”—that is, to suspend certain {{civil and political}} liberties—in response to crises. The drafters of these treaties envisioned that international restrictions on <b>derogations</b> <b>and</b> international notification and monitoring mechanisms would limit rights suspensions during emergencies. This article analyzes the behavior of derogating countries using new global datasets of <b>derogations</b> <b>and</b> states of emergency from 1976 to 2007. We argue that derogations are a rational response to domestic political uncertainty. They enable governments facing serious threats to buy time and legal breathing space from voters, courts, and interest groups to confront crises while signaling to these audiences that rights deviations are temporary and lawful. Our findings have implications for the studies of treaty design and flexibility mechanisms and compliance with international human rights agreements...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of Art. 87 (1) EC to taxes above all {{is connected to}} the {{application of}} the derogation method, which appears {{to be part of the}} selectivity criterion. This dissertation examines the application of the <b>derogation</b> method <b>and</b> the assessment of the selectivity criterion applied to taxes, primarily de lege lata, but also de lege ferenda. It begins with an analysis of the relationship among the criteria of Article 87 (1) EC and continues with an analysis of the relationship between the <b>derogation</b> method <b>and</b> the assessment of the selectivity criterion applied to taxes. Several scholars have criticised the application of the derogation method because of the difficulty of identifying a <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> of establishing the benchmark against which the derogation should be assessed. In this dissertation both the benchmark and the establishment of a derogation is analysed, partly with reference to the tax expenditure debate that occurred in the subject area of international taxation during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The selectivity criterion applied to taxes contains an assessment of justification, whereby the selective nature of a measure can be justified on the basis of the nature or general scheme of the system: Therfore the meaning and implications of this assessment are also examined. After all these issues have been examined de lege lata, the extents to which the application of the <b>derogation</b> method <b>and</b> the assessment of the selectivity criterion follow a logical system are discussed and recommendations for eliminating the identified deficiences are put forward...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]. As the European Union is {{preparing}} to launch the discussions that will eventually lead to the admission of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus, a question that is increasingly being asked by the prospective members is what should they hope to obtain from those discussions or accession negotiations. They have already {{been told that the}} negotiations will determine their terms of accession and will ascertain their ability to assume the obligations of membership or ‘acquis communautaire’. In fact what they like to know is whether they could receive any exceptions or special treatment that will ease the pain of adjustment to life inside the EU. They want to know whether and how they can obtain derogations from the acquis. Yet, "derogation" is a dirty word in the European Union. No one admits it exists, nor {{that it is possible to}} obtain any during the accession negotiations. This short paper attempts to separate myth from reality and highlight what may be realistically pursued in the negotiations [...] The rest of this short paper explains why negotiations are necessary, reviews the various types of <b>derogations</b> <b>and</b> provide examples from past accession negotiations to indicate what appears to be a feasible request for <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> how past applicant countries presented and justified their requests...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the temporary derogations, that are automatically discontinued {{after the end of}} the transitional period, the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification is permanent and its discontinuation is conditional only on the positive assessment of benchmarks fulfillment in the regular reports issued by the Commission.

According to the treaties the new member states are obliged to fulfill the benchmarks for discontinuation of both these permanent <b>derogations</b> <b>and</b> the CVMs, but some of them deliberately delay these processes. The CVM is thus different from the Enhanced co-operation mechanism, where generally all EU members are free to opt-in at any time into an already established Enhanced co-operation initiative, without preconditions.|$|R

As political elites have polarized, the American public {{has become more}} strongly partisan. Why has the American public become more extremely partisan, and what does this transformation of the electorate imply {{for the health of}} American democracy? In this thesis, I argue that elite polarization has strengthened the relationship between a basic psychological motivation for group membership—the need for certainty—and partisan strength, in-party favoritism, out-party <b>derogation,</b> <b>and</b> conformity to group leaders. Because the need for certainty is a form of motivated closed-mindedness, I argue that the American electorate today is increasingly composed of rigid partisans: partisans who are uncritically extremist, biased, and intolerant. 	Across a number of distinct empirical studies, this thesis demonstrates that, (1) partisan strength, in-group favoritism, out-group <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> partisan sorting have a strong basis in the psychological need for certainty, (2) in many cases this pre-political psychological variable has larger effects on partisan strength than explicitly political variables such as policy preferences, (3) that this effect occurs among both Democrats and Republicans, (4) that this has caused politically engaged respondents in particular to be rigid in their partisan identity, and (5) that this relationship has grown stronger over time as political elites have polarized and become more internally cohesive and distinct. In conclusion, I argue that the transformation of the public into rigid partisans weakens the competence of the American electorate and threatens the foundations of American democracy...|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{has traditionally}} been studied as men's harassment of women. This {{has led to a}} lack of knowledge about same sex harassment, and women harassing peers. This has also downplayed the inherent sexual nature of sexual harassment acts. While keeping in mind that sexual harassment is undesirable and causes distress, one needs to consider that many acts that are perceived as unwanted may not primarily be motivated by a wish to derogate but rather by an interest in soliciting short-term sex. In the current study we examined both perpetrators as well as victims of harassment, and specified both sex of perpetrator and target (a total of eight sex constellations). We reproduced the previously found association between unrestricted sociosexuality and sexual harassment in a representative sample of 1326 high school students (57 % women). In all regression models sociosexuality outcompeted traditional measures such as porn exposure, rape stereotypes and hostile sexism. Based on the original work we divided the harassment acts into two groups of tactics: sexual solicitation <b>and</b> competitor <b>derogation.</b> Men were particularly subject to derogatory tactics from other men, while women were particularly subject to solicitation from opposite sex peers. Sexual harassment may be understood better from a human sexual strategies perspective, including competitor <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> mate solicitation. As such, sociosexual orientation predicts both same sex <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> opposite sex solicitation. The current results highlight the importance of considering the sex of both perpetrator and target. This advanced understanding of the inherently sexual nature of sexual harassment needs to inform future prevention studies. Unrestricted sociosexuality predicts sexual harassment in all constellations better than traditional social science models...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, victim <b>derogation</b> <b>and</b> other {{strategies}} {{may only be}} ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering.

Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to Ervin Staub, devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. Psychopathy has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.|$|R
