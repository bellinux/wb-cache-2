5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by <b>hexane</b> extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as <b>hexane</b> and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
40|$|In aqueous phosphoric acid, {{cellulose}} was efficiently {{converted into}} <b>hexanes</b> using a Ru/C catalyst combined with layered compounds or silica-alumina materials. In this process, the direct production of <b>hexanes</b> from cellulose {{can be improved}} by suppressing the formation of isosorbide, which {{makes it difficult to}} yield <b>hexanes</b> by further hydrodeoxygenation. As the co-catalyst, layered compounds showed a significant inhibition effect on the formation of isosorbide from sorbitol due to the steric restrictions of sorbitol dehydration within the interlayers of layered compounds. Typically, layered LiNbMoO 6 played a great role in promoting the production of <b>hexanes</b> directly from cellulose and a promising yield (72 % carbon mol) of <b>hexanes</b> was obtained. In addition, the protonic acid, H 3 PO 4, offered efficient catalysis for the hydrolysis of cellulose and the dehydration of the sorbitol hydroxyl moiety...|$|R

5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and <b>hexane.</b> With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E

25|$|Sorbitol is {{identified}} as a potential key chemical intermediate for production of fuels from biomass resources. Carbohydrate fractions in biomass such as cellulose undergo sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation {{in the presence of}} metal catalysts to produce sorbitol. Complete reduction of sorbitol opens the way to alkanes, such as <b>hexane,</b> which {{can be used as a}} biofuel. Hydrogen required for this reaction can be produced by aqueous phase catalytic reforming of sorbitol.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, C5H12; <b>hexane,</b> C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin prefix non-. For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.|$|E
25|$|More {{volatile}} short-chain alkanes {{are also}} produced by and found in plant tissues. The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} n-heptane in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and <b>hexane</b> by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of biogenic air pollution.|$|E

25|$|The {{mobile phase}} is the phase that moves in a {{definite}} direction. It {{may be a}} liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as <b>hexane</b> in normal phase or a polar solvent such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. <b>hexane).</b> Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS).

25|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{shows that}} all six carbon-carbon bonds in benzene {{are of the}} same length, at 140 picometres (pm). The C–C bond lengths are greater than a double bond (135 pm) but shorter than a single bond (147 pm). This intermediate distance is consistent with electron delocalization: the electrons for C–C bonding are distributed equally between {{each of the six}} carbon atoms. Benzene has 6 hydrogen atoms – fewer than the corresponding parent alkane, <b>hexane.</b> The molecule is planar. The MO description involves the formation of three delocalized π orbitals spanning all six carbon atoms, while the VB description involves a superposition of resonance structures. It is likely that this stability contributes to the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known as aromaticity. To accurately reflect the nature of the bonding, benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms.|$|E

25|$|The optical {{absorption}} spectrum of pyridine in <b>hexane</b> contains three bands at the wavelengths of 195nm (π→π* transition, molar absorptivity ε=7500L·mol−1·cm−1), 251nm (π→π* transition, ε=2000L·mol−1·cm−1) and 270nm (n→π* transition, ε=450L·mol−1·cm−1). The 1H {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectrum of pyridine contains three signals with the integral intensity ratio of 2:1:2 that correspond to the three chemically different protons in the molecule. These signals originate from the α-protons (positions 2 and 6, chemical shift 8.5ppm), γ-proton (position 4, 7.5ppm) and β-protons (positions 3 and 5, 7.1ppm). The carbon analog of pyridine, benzene, has only one proton signal at 7.27ppm. The larger chemical shifts of the α- and γ-protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the α- and γ-positions, which {{can be derived from}} the resonance structures. The situation is rather similar for the 13CNMR spectra of pyridine and benzene: pyridine shows a triplet at δ(α-C)=150ppm, δ(β-C)=124ppm and δ(γ-C)=136ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129ppm. All shifts are quoted for the solvent-free substances. Pyridine is conventionally detected by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods.|$|E
25|$|Solvent casting and {{particulate}} leaching (SCPL) {{allows for}} the preparation of structures with regular porosity, but with limited thickness. First, the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent (e.g. polylactic acid could be dissolved into dichloromethane), then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles. Such porogen can be an inorganic salt like sodium chloride, crystals of saccharose, gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres. The size of the porogen particles will affect {{the size of the}} scaffold pores, while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure. After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate, then the composite structure in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen: water in the case of sodium chloride, saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like <b>hexane</b> for use with paraffin. Once the porogen has been fully dissolved, a porous structure is obtained. Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained, another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold.|$|E
