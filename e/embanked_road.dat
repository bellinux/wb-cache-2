25|$|Bernadotte {{determined}} to attack at 10:00 AM. Holding back his cavalry and the 96th Line, he sent Dupont's 32nd Line charging for the bridges, with one battalion of the 9th Light and three guns in support. Racing along the <b>embanked</b> <b>road</b> in columns and flanked by skirmishers, the French punched through the defenders {{to seize the}} first bridge and the island. The Prussians foot soldiers {{on either side of}} the road were cut off from the bridge and became prisoners. Those dragoons who did not pull back in time were forced to swim across the river. In less than an hour, Dupont's troops captured all three bridges and General von Hinrichs. They burst into the town, overwhelmed a Prussian battalion in the marketplace, and chased a second battalion out the Steinthor. Rapidly, Halle was occupied along with both the Galgenthor and Steinthor. Here the French paused to wait for the rest of Bernadotte's corps to appear.|$|E

2500|$|In the Industrial Revolution, John Loudon McAdam (1756–1836) {{designed}} {{the first modern}} highways, using inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (macadam), and he <b>embanked</b> <b>roads</b> a few feet higher than the surrounding terrain to cause water to drain away from the surface. [...] With the development of motor transport there was an increased need for hard-topped roads to reduce washaways, bogging and dust on both urban and rural roads, originally using cobblestones and wooden paving in major western cities {{and in the early}} 20th century tar-bound macadam (tarmac) and concrete paving were extended into the countryside.|$|R
40|$|Anastomosing rivers were {{historically}} common {{around the}} world before extensive agricultural and industrial development in river valleys. Few lowland anastomosing rivers remain in temperate zones, {{and the protection of}} these river-floodplain systems is an international conservation priority. However, the mechanisms that drive the creation and maintenance of multiple channels, i. e. anabranches, are not well understood, particularly for lowland rivers, making it challenging to identify effective management strategies. This study uses a novel multi-scale, process-based hydro-geomorphological approach to investigate the natural and anthropogenic controls on anastomosis in lowland river reaches. Using a wide range of data (hydrologic, cartographic, remote-sensing, historical), the study (i) quantifies changes in the planform of the River Narew, Poland over the last 100 years, (ii) documents changes in the natural and anthropogenic factors that could be driving the geomorphic change, and (iii) develops a conceptual model of the controls of anastomosis. The results show that 110 km of anabranches have been lost from the Narew National Park (6810 ha), a 42 % reduction in total anabranch length since 1900. The rates of anabranch loss have increased as the number of pressures inhibiting anabranch creation and maintenance has multiplied. The cessation of localized water level and channel management (fishing dams, water mills and timber rafting), the loss of traditional floodplain activities (seasonal mowing) and infrastructure construction (<b>embanked</b> <b>roads</b> and an upstream dam) are contributing to low water levels and flows, the deposition of sediment at anabranch inlets, the encroachment of common reed (Phragmites australis), and the eventual loss of anabranches. By identifying the processes driving the loss of anabranches, this study provides transferable insights into the controls of anastomosis in lowland rivers and the management solutions needed to preserve the unique anastomosing river pattern and diverse wet grasslands that are central to the conservation value of lowland floodplains...|$|R

40|$|In the 2 ̆ 2 Environmental Quality Standards for Noise, 2 ̆ 2 {{the problem}} of {{environmental}} noise in areas facing roads is evaluated by obtaining the numbers and the rates of the buildings at which noise levels exceed the environmental quality standards. In order to estimate noise distribution in the residential area facing roads, {{it is necessary to}} grasp the insertion loss caused by the buildings. The authors proposed in the previous study a simple method to predict the insertion loss of road traffic noise caused by detached houses when the road is at the same level with that of the houses. However, there are lots of residential areas where are located around an <b>embanked</b> <b>road.</b> In such residential areas, the noise would be expected to be higher. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to derive a new method to predict the insertion loss of road traffic noise caused by detached houses when a road is embanked. A one-twentieth scale model experiment is performed. On the basis of the experimental results, to extend the authors 2 ̆ 7 previous predicting method to be applicable when a road is embanked is examined, and then a simple procedure to compensate the increase of noise level caused by the increase of the height of a road is derived. The results of an additional experiment, comparison with the former studies, and comparison with the measurement verify the validity of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|In the {{background}} of the late-Holocene landscape of the Southern Valli Grandi Veronesi (VGVM) and nearby Bonifica Padana, an area that stretches between rivers Adige and Po and which is drained by the river Tartaro, was taken into consideration the position of a long embankment that ran through the territories of the two large moated sites of the middle and recent Bronze Age, Fondo Paviani (FP) to east, and Castello del Tartaro (CdT) to west. The location of this particular embankment called SAM (from italian southern <b>embanked</b> <b>road),</b> more than ten km long, and arranged parallel to the Tartaro old riparian belt, since long time attracted scholars as a witness of an old territorial organization, probably related to spatial distribution of cultivated or pasture by the communities who lived in the two large villages, bounded by massive ditch and bank systems. On the basis of recent acquisitions of new DEM and LIDAR sources and aimed field investigations, then merged into geo-chronological and chrono-typological analysis in the laboratory, was developed a research addressed the chrono-stratigraphic, cultural-evolutionary and functional scan of the SAM construct. For this purpose, the archaeological, stratigraphic and chronological record have been reviewed from a series of very significant off-sites, with stratigraphic columns documenting paleo-environmental and archaeological-functional reconstructions. They allowed to established the obvious links between the infrastructure of the ditches of the SAM embankment and the network of secondary rural ditches that seemed to drain and distribute waters in the parceled fields next to the large contemporary sites. In Ponte Moro off-site we captured the chrono-stratigraphic position of SAM embankment through the dating of two peat samples undertaken immediately before and after the stratigraphic position of the embankment. The datings have yielded an earliest date for the construction (MBA-RBA) and a later date of the abandonment of the earthen structure (RBA-FBA). In the Fosso Sarego off-site the stratigraphy documented the composition and the morphology of the embankment and its lateral ditches. These were connected with the neighboring ditches and drains, and especially with the droveway, a road of service for herding that crossed the cultivated area of the CdT near-site, to reach meadows and pastures of wetlands placed within the perifluvial r. Tartaro strechtes. On the sections and on open-area excavations at the Fosso Fazzion off-site were found the remains of anthropic surfaces, connected with the use of pits and silos well placed next to small sites (farms), corresponding to the first evidence of a stable-occupation of land, dating back to the transition between the EBA and MBA. In the Stanghelle off-site were detected morphologies of long pairs of rural ditches filled by manure from the nearby village and dated to a horizon of between EBA and MBA, similarly to Fazzion off-site. Finally at the near-site the so-called hydraulic- node of CdT, an open-area investigated at the intersection of drains protruding from the moat of the SE corral, ceramic fragments in situ dating to RBA were recovered, attesting the connections with irrigation ditches around small enclosed fields. The comparison of these datings, the relative chronology and stratigraphic relationships established between SAM, channels, ditches, and agrarian drains revealed the possibility of achieving a first definition of land organization in two agrarian-settlement phases for the two major CdT and FP sites. The archaeobotanist contribution from a first set of pollen analysis carried out from Ponte Moro samples, allowed to specify the important role of grass-grazing percent in relation of cultivated land and woodland, the latter testified by an higher percent of AP compared to the average of Emilian data. The chronological contribution from finds proposed here, concerned the analysis of a complete sample of ceramic material recovered from a intrasite excavation by F. Zorzi made around the mid of the last century and documented in a dissertation by Zanetti (1970 - 71). It allowed {{for the first time to}} present aspects of material culture (pottery facies), belonging to the first large RBA settlement of CdT, surrounded by the embanked. On these basis was initiated a revision of the stratigraphic position of the two samples for 14 C dating collected in the 90 ’s of the last century from the great embankment of CdT, both related to MBA/RBA. In the light of the analysis of the above mentioned ceramics, it was possible to discriminate a phase of MBA 3 nucleated site without bounding embankment, but probably with a moat, from the later phase of RBA with massive embankment and surrounded by multiple ditches. Finally, the juxtaposition of the two systems separated from the earthen bank of the SAM, first meadows and pastures, latter fields delimited by long ditches (maybe opened fields) and others small and closed, it has given rise to an important result directed to the definition of socio-political organisation which regulated this fundamental transect in the MBA-RBA for the economy and polity of VGVM near the sites of CDT and FP. The construction of the SAM embankment, erected to preserve the balanced distribution of lands allocated to support the two major sites, could therefore be reviewed as an expression of a huge collective work, continuously maintained, presumably demanded by the elite-polity of VGVM, to prevent the formation of peatlands. These, due to the rise of water table for paleoidrographic reasons, tended to invade the cultivated fields. This engineering earthwork had to play an important role for regulation and control for the drain and irrigation network made of main and secondary ditches extending to the nearby fields, before dissipating in the lower land of marginal pasture-wet meadows, next to fluvial woodland...|$|E
