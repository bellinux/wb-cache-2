5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E
5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A {{as a product}} UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
5|$|With the {{off-season}} acquisition of Mitch Clark in the 2011 trade period, who was {{projected to be}} the number one forward in the team, the forward load {{was expected to be}} relieved off of Watts, who new coach, Mark Neeld, stated would play primarily as a forward alongside Clark, rather than as both a <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> as was the case the previous season. He struggled for form during the 2012 NAB Cup where he had just three combined possessions in the first two matches against Brisbane and Gold Coast, before he was substituted out of the match against Collingwood the next week where he managed just seven disposals, which drew the ire of former Collingwood coach, Mick Malthouse, who said he lacked ambition when playing. He was subsequently omitted for the final pre-season match against Port Adelaide.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the global match demands of international rugby sevens and to compare the match demands of <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> between tournament rounds. To assess the match demands, global positioning system (GPS) and video analysis were collected from 27 international rugby sevens players from the same team across an entire International Rugby Board Sevens World Series season. Differences in running demands and match activities between <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> were mostly trivial and small (ES = 0. 05 – 0. 84) while differences in running demands and match activities between Pool and Cup rounds were trivial (ES = 0. 001 – 0. 12). Cup round matches showed an increase in long- duration ball-in-play sequences (proportion ratio 0. 46). These fi ndings suggest international rugby sevens <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> experience similar match demands while overall match demands remain consistent across tournament rounds...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the hypothesis {{that there were no}} significant differences between <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> in the elements of leg power between the ID and DD genotypes of the ACE (I/D) gene in developing young adult Rugby Union players. METHODS: Sixty-eight players were recruited to identify the distribution of genotypes between <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs.</b> Fifty-eight players were investigated for leg power. Forwards (n= 28) comprised 15 ID and 13 DD genotypes, <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> (n= 30) 19 ID and 11 DD genotypes. Leg power was measured on a force platform using a counter movement jump; the parameters of interest were peak and relative force, peak and relative power, displacement and velocity. The three-primer polymerase chain reaction was used to assay the region of interest for I and D variants of the ACE gene. The distribution of genotypes was determined by chi-square <b>and</b> comparisons between <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> made using the independent t-test. RESULTS: No significant differences were identified in the distribution of genotypes between <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> (c 2 = 2. 2, P= 0. 336). However, significant differences were identified between <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> in a number of components of leg power. Backs had significantly larger values than forwards for relative force (1. 50 vs. 1. 30 Wt%, P= 0. 001) and relative power (27. 1 vs. 24. 3 W. kg- 1, P= 0. 034) for the ID genotype, whereas backs had significantly larger values than forwards for displacement (0. 42 vs. 0. 38 m, P= 0. 049) and velocity (2. 76 vs. 2. 55 m. s. - 1, P= 0. 007) for the DD genotype. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of leg power identified will enhance the functional requirements of players according to playing position and commitment...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the influence of physical fitness on match activities and post-match fatigue, players from both the high- and low-standard team were matched for position (<b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs)</b> before being divided into low- and high-fitness groups, using a median split, based on Yo-Yo IRT performance. This ensured that there was an even number of <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> in both fitness groups so that the fatigue responses were not influenced by the different match activities performed by each positional group. This provided us with four experimental groups based on Yo-Yo IRT performance: high-standard/high-fitness, high-standard/low-fitness, low-standard/high-fitness, and low-standard/low-fitness.|$|R

25|$|There are no set {{positions}} in {{the rules of the}} game, but traditionally the field was divided into three major sections: the forward line, back line, and midfield. The <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> lines consisted of six players, arranged into two lines of three players each. The midfield generally consists of the designated ruckman (i.e. player who contests the ruck or bounce-down) and players who either stay in the centre area of the ground (between the two 50 metre arcs) or follow the ball and are not confined to a particular area.|$|E
25|$|Fresnels use a spherical {{reflector}}, {{with the}} lamp at the focus point. The lamp and reflector remain a fixed unit inside the housing, and are moved <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> {{to focus the}} light. This is accomplished using a slider on the bottom or side of the lantern, or using a worm track. At very tight focus, the lanterns are the least efficient, as the least light can escape the housing. Therefore, Fresnels are not good for tight focus on small areas. They are most often used at medium distances from the stage for area lighting.|$|E
25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to throw back the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver jerked the two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.|$|E

25|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic Loom was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a power loom. It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or treadles, operate the loom it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of the loom are connected via crankshaft and gear wheels. Because the loom is designed to use only one shuttle when weaving, giving a solid colour in the weft, it is termed a plain loom. The cast metal chair, manufactured along with the loom, can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> as the weaver treadles the loom.|$|E
500|$|The cables were spun on-site using a reel {{because of}} the {{problems}} which had arisen using a bundle on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. This also allowed for cost savings, as the reels could be used two times. The cables were spun using air spinning with controlled tension, which allowed spinning with little space and with a crew with limited spinning experience. This involved installing a carrier which shuttles <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> over the catwalk; it spins the upper side of the cable in the one direction and the lower side in the other direction. The system has two reel racks, each with four reels of wire. Each rack only uses one reel at a time, allowing for minimum down-time when changing reels. Wires were connected using pressure casing. The balance in the system is kept in place using a counterbalance tower. Spinning of the main cable started on 2 March 2000 and was concluded on 14 April. In all [...] of steel wire were used to create the cables. The two bridges were {{the first time that}} on-site spinning was chosen in Norway, and it gave a cost saving of NOK10 to 11 million.|$|E
