40|$|This paper {{presents}} one of {{the possible}} hazardous situations during transportation of gas through the <b>international</b> <b>pipeline.</b> It describes the case when at high-pressure gas pipeline, due to mechanical or chemical effect, cracks and a gas leakage appears and the gas is somehow triggered to burn. As a consequence of heat impingement on the pipe surface, change of material properties (decreasing of strength) at high temperatures will occur. In order to avoid greater rapture a reasonable pressure relief rate needs to be applied. Standards in this particular domain of depressurizing procedure are not so exact (DIN EN ISO 23251; API 521). This paper {{was a part of}} the project to make initial contribution in defining the appropriate procedure of gas operator behaving during the rare gas leakage and burning situations on pipeline network. The main part of the work consists of two calculations. The first is the numerical simulation of heat radiation of combustible gas, which affects the pipeline, done in the FLUENT software. The second is the implementation of obtained results as a boundary condition in an additional calculation of time resolved wall temperature of the pipe under consideration this temperature depending on the incident flux as well as a number of other heat flow rates, using the Matlab.

40|$|In most settings, from <b>international</b> <b>pipelines</b> to home water supplies, {{the drag}} caused by {{turbulence}} raises pumping costs many {{times higher than}} if the flow were laminar. Drag reduction has therefore long been an aim of high priority. In order to achieve this end, any drag reduction method must modify the turbulent mean flow. Motivated by minimization of the input energy this requires, linearly optimal forcing functions are examined. It is shown that the forcing mode leading to the greatest response of the flow is always of m= 1 azimuthal symmetry. Little evidence is seen of the second peak at large m (wall modes) found in analogous optimal growth calculations, which may have implications for control strategies. The model's prediction of large response of the large length-scale modes is verified in full direct numerical simulation of turbulence (Re= 5300, Re_τ≈ 180). Further, drag reduction of over 12...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} clean energy sources is {{expanding}} investment in natural gas infrastructure around the world. Many <b>international</b> projects involve <b>pipelines</b> connecting energy markets {{in two or}} more countries. A key feature of investment taking place in Latin America is the convergence of gas and electricity markets. Many projects are being developed to supply gas to new power generation plants needed to meet electricity demand. Construction of a pipeline over the Andes mountains to supply gas from Argentina to energy markets in central Chile was an idea long unfulfilled for political, economic, and technical reasons. Great changes have now taken place {{in a very short}} time. The author discusses both the achievements and the challenges to be faced by pipeline developers and Chile's energy sector. He details the benefits of the cooperative effort to consumers in terms of lower energy prices, higher environmental standards, and a more reliable energy system.

40|$|Special {{issue on}} {{interaction}} between compilers and computer architectures. <b>International</b> audienceSoftware <b>pipelining</b> can generate efficient schedules for loop by overlapping {{the execution of}} operations from different iterations in order to exploit maximum Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP). Code optimization can decrease total number of calculations and memory related operations. As a result, instruction schedules can use freed resources to construct shorter schedules. Particularly, when the data is not presented in cache, the performance will be significantly degraded by memory references. Therefore, elimination of redundant load-store operations is most important for improving overall performance. This paper introduces a method for integrating software pipelining and load-store elimination techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrated algorithm {{is more effective than}} other methods...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>pipeline</b> {{to get the}} semi-regular mesh of a {{specific}} physical object is long and fastidious: physical acquisition (creating a dense point cloud), cleaning/meshing (creating an irregular triangle mesh), and semi-regular remeshing. Moreover, these three stages are generally independent, and processed successively by different tools. To overcome this issue, we propose in this paper a new framework to design semi-regular meshes directly from stereoscopic images. Our semi-regular reconstruction technique first creates a base mesh by using a feature-preserving sampling on the stereoscopic images. Afterwards, this base mesh is passed to a coarse-to-fine meshing process to get the semi-regular mesh of the original surface. Experimental results prove the reliability and the accuracy of our approach in terms of shape fidelity, compactness, but also runtime, since many steps have been parallelized on the GPU...|$|R
