[...] "Here was a man who had explored all these mystic religions, had undergone Gestalt therapy, who had been told by a Rosacrucian master that he had something called an 'Angelic Knot', suddenly hanging around fashionable nightclubs and being written about in gossip columns. The relationship with Michelle Rocca certainly helped, in that I got more out of one single interview done by Michelle Rocca than <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>in</b> entirety, from his first wife, Janet Planet," [...] said Rogan.|$|E

[...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother.

[...] In 1991, Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three-month-old girl, who badly needed medical treatment for a severe cleft palate, to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa; the McCains decided to adopt her, and named her Bridget. [...] A drawn-out adoption process began, slowed down by uncertainty over the exact fate of the girl's father, but in 1993 the adoption was ruled final. [...] McCain then stood by his wife when she disclosed in 1994 a previous addiction to painkillers {{and said that she}} hoped the publicity would give other drug addicts courage in their struggles.

Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job.

When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up like <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me.
