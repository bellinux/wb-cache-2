40|$|INTRODUCTION MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{group of}} small, noncoding {{endogenous}} RNA (21 - 25 nucleotides long) with {{an important role in}} gene expression regulation by targeting specific mRNAs in plants, animals and humans. To date, no miRNAs from marigold (Calendula officinalis), one of the best known medicinal plants, have been identified. OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND Identification of plant microRNAs that survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract following digestion in mice MATERIALS AND METHODS - Small plant RNA isolation and extraction -Sequencing data analysis and plant miRNA identification -Animal experiment RESULTS The cDNA libraries of two tissues from Calendula (petals and inflorescence) were prepared and small RNAseq were conducted according to Illumina's protocols. A total number of 4 miRNAs, with 0 mismatches, (mir 166 a, lus-mir 166 e, ppt-mir 894 and ath-mir 8175), were identified based on their sequence complementarities. CONCLUSIONS The potentially conserved miRNAs from Calendula were identifiend only in inflorescence, the part that is being used for medicinal purposes. These aspects could lead to a better comprehension of the relationship between <b>exogenous</b> plant <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> and the changes that occur in mammals following oral ingestion.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the corrosive interplay between the patent-based and the sovereign- based systems of ownership of <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> In patent-based systems, <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is increasingly “owned” by corporations or research institutions which obtain patents over such material. In sovereign-based systems, {{the national government}} owns or extensively controls such material. As more patents issue for synthesized genes in developed countries through the patent system, more raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> is legally enclosed by the governments of developing nations, which house most of the world’s wild or raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> This interactive spiral of increased enclosure results in the sub-optimal utilization, conservation and improvement of vital <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> This article adds to the scholarship that critiques the patenting of <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in the United States {{by focusing on the}} international collateral damage occasioned by overbroad patenting in this area. In addition, it takes the first comprehensive critical look at the sovereign-based system. It argues that sovereign ownership or extensive control over <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (i) risks creating an anticommons in raw <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (ii) threatens the liberty and autonomy of individuals and indigenous communities whose property contains such material and (iii) is premised on a flawed approach in international law that has led to broad and unenforceable regimes that will increase tensions between nations. Moreover, the interaction between the patent-based and the sovereign-based systems risks setting off a major trade dispute under the TRIPS Agreement. To repair this situation, I propose a framework for a more open system for <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> I recommend that the United States take into account the adverse reaction of other countries when determining as a utilitarian matter whether and, if so, to what extent to allow patents for <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> Expansive patent rights over <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> can cause innovation in the biotechnology field to fall to suboptimal levels because they cause sovereigns in the world’s most genetically diverse nations to curtail access to the raw material that contributes to such innovation.

50|$|Artificial {{introduction}} of long dsRNAs or siRNAs {{has been adopted}} {{as a tool to}} inactivate gene expression, both in cultured cells and in living organisms. Structural and functional resolution of small RNAs as the effectors of RNA silencing has had a direct impact on experimental biology. For example, dsRNA may be synthesized to have a specific sequence complementary to a gene of interest. Once introduced into a cell or biological system, it is recognized as <b>exogenous</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> and activates the corresponding RNA silencing pathway. This mechanism can be used to effect decreases in gene expression with respect to the target, useful for investigating loss of function for genes relative to a phenotype. That is, studying the phenotypic and/or physiologic effects of expression decreases can reveal the role of a gene product. The observable effects can be nuanced, such that some methods can distinguish between “knockdown” (decrease expression) and “knockout” (eliminate expression) of a gene. RNA interference technologies have been noted recently {{as one of the most}} widely utilized techniques in functional genomics. Screens developed using small RNAs have been used to identify genes involved in fundamental processes such as cell division, apoptosis and fat regulation.|$|E

50|$|Cephalosporins {{must get}} through the {{bacterial}} cell wall {{in order to reach}} the target PBP. In comparison, it is easier to penetrate the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria than the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. The cell wall structure of gram-positive bacteria is made routinely up by peptidoglycan which allows the passage of cephalosporin-sized molecules. The cell wall structure of gram-negative bacteria is more complex, composed of polysaccharides, lipids and proteins, and is harder to penetrate. Particles {{get through the}} outer membrane through water-filled channels, or porins, which are trans membrane proteins.During exposure to cephalosporins the bacteria can form resistance by itself or as selection of the next generation of bacteria after reproducing itself, by mutation.Bacteria species such as pneumococci and meningococci can acquire <b>exogenous</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material,</b> and incorporate it into their own chromosomes which leads to antimicrobial resistance.In that manner the target PBP can be altered to have their attraction for cephalosporins and other β-lactam antibiotics lowered. The bacteria can also replace the PBP that is vulnerable to Beta-lactam antibiotics with PBP that is less vulnerable.β-lactam antibiotics can be inactivated by many types of β-lactamases, which are produced by bacteria. The enzymes hydrolyze the bond between the carbon and nitrogen atom of the β-lactam ring. There are many beta lactamases which vary in substrate specificity and host range. The enzymes active site is easily regenerated hydrolytically so it is re-usable many times, in that way can a comparatively small amount of beta-lactamases destroy a large amount of drug. Gram-positive bacteria, such as a staphylococci, have a high release of beta-lactamases into their extracellular space, where they meet the drug outside the cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria on the other hand follow a more conservative course. They secrete their beta-lactamases into the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membrane so they can't easily escape into the extracellular space, and don't have to be biosynthesized in high quantities.|$|E
40|$|A gene is {{a unit of}} {{heredity}} in {{a living}} organism. It normally resides on a stretch of DNA that codes for a type of protein or for an RNA chain that has a function in the organism. All living things depend on genes, as they specify all proteins and functional RNA chains. Genes hold the information to build and maintain an organism’s cells and pass genetic traits to offspring.

Bacteria can uptake <b>exogenous</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> by three ways: conjugation, transduction and transformation. Genetic material is naturally transferred to bacteria in case of conjugation and transferred through bacteriophage in transduction. Transformation is the acquisition of <b>exogenous</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> through cell wall.

Divalent Calcium ions can make the bacteria competent and a heat shock can cause the bacteria to uptake DNA. But the heat shock method cannot be used for all the bacteria. In electroporation, a brief electric shock with an electric field of 10 - 20 kV/cmmakes pores in the cell wall, facilitates the DNA to enter into the bacteria.
