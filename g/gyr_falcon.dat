500|$|The white {{protective}} coloration {{of arctic}} animals was noted by an early student of camouflage, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in his 1889 book Darwinism; he listed the polar bear, the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the <b>gyr</b> <b>falcon</b> as remaining white all year, while the arctic fox, arctic hare, ermine and ptarmigan change their colour, and observed [...] "the obvious explanation", {{that it was}} for concealment. Later zoologists such as Hugh B. Cott have echoed his observations, adding that other animals of the Arctic such as musk ox, moose, reindeer, wolverine and raven never become white [...] "even in the coldest parts of their range". Cott noted that both animals that hunt, like polar bear and stoat, and prey animals like ptarmigan and mountain hare, require camouflage to hide from prey or from predators respectively. There is little experimental evidence for the adaptiveness of white as camouflage, though the ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan [...] "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that cryptic brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." [...] All the same, he notes, [...] "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by Gyrfalcons throughout the winter." ...|$|E
50|$|Kamchatka {{is famous}} for the {{abundance}} and size of its brown bears. In the Kronotsky Nature Reserve there {{are estimated to be}} three to four bears per 100 square kilometres. Other fauna of note include carnivores such as tundra wolf (Canis lupus albus), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) Anadyr fox (Vulpes vulpes beringiana), East Siberian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli), wolverine (Gulo gulo), sable (Martes zibellina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), East Siberian stoat (Mustela ermine kaneii) and Siberian least weasel (Mustela nivalis pygmaea). The peninsula hosts habitat for several large ungulates including the Kamchatka snow sheep, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and Chukotka moose (Alces alces burulini) one of the largest moose {{in the world and the}} largest in Eurasia; and rodents/leporids, including mountain hare (Lepus timidus), marmot, and several species of lemming and squirrel.The peninsula is the breeding ground for Steller's sea eagle, one of the largest eagle species, along with the golden eagle and <b>gyr</b> <b>falcon.</b>|$|E

40|$|Twenty-eight STR loci were {{screened}} in wild populations of six {{bird of prey}} species providing allele frequencies and population genetic parameters necessary {{for the application of}} STRs in wildlife forensic genetic casework. Individual STR loci were validated according to forensic recommendations in specimens of golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), merlin (Falco columbarius), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), <b>gyr</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco rusticolus) and saker falcon (Falco cherrug). Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations and linkage disequilibrium between locus pairs were examined. The average probability of identity (PI(ave)) and power of exclusion (PE) suggest the profiling systems of golden eagle, goshawk, merlin and peregrine falcons are capable of providing robust and highly discriminatory forensic evidence for legal proceedings. Due to low sample numbers the allele frequency data for gyr and saker falcons is not currently capable of providing an effective probability of identity. Further work should focus on increasing the size of these data sets. 11179...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} eggshell {{strength in}} a group of falcon taxa including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus peregrinus), the red shaheen falcon (F. peregrinus babylonicus), the saker falcon (F. cherrug), the <b>gyr</b> <b>falcon</b> (F. rusticolus) and some interspecific and intraspecific hybrids. Our results showed that smaller falcons (o 1, 000 g) of the peregrine group have eggshells that are significantly softer (x 5 13. 3 N) and thinner (x 5 0. 26 mm) (n 5 107 eggs) than larger falcons (41, 000 g) of the gyr-saker group (x 5 20. 8 N and 0. 39 mm, respectively, n 5 81 eggs). We found a significant positive correlation between egg hardness and eggshell thickness. Linear mixed models showed that clutches from heavier females consisted of larger and harder eggs with thicker shells and thicker egg membranes. Eggs produced by older females and eggs laid later in the laying sequence were relatively smaller and softer and had relatively thin egg membranes and eggshells. Individual females, irrespective of their age, contributed significantly to the observed variation in egg strength. Egg size and hardness of hybrid eggs were {{similar to that of the}} pure species suggesting that hybridization does not affect eggshell hardness or thickness. Our study provides quantitative evidence of several factors, other than levels of contamination, which may affect eggshell thickness and hardness in falconsPeer reviewe...|$|E
50|$|The park {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{wilderness}} areas still intact in Western Norway. Much of the original alpine ecosystem, including wild reindeer, wolverines, golden eagles, <b>gyr</b> <b>falcons,</b> and ptarmigans, is still intact. The park is made up of numerous mountains and valleys. The highest mountains in the park tower more than 2000 m above sea level. The landscape in Reinheimen is extremely varied. In the west, it is very dramatic, with sharply pointed peaks and knife-edge ridges, and rapidly flowing rivers. Towards the east, the terrain is more gently sloping, plateaus occur, valleys are broader and rivers flow more slowly. A number of rivers, such as the Istra, Rauma, Lora, Finna/Skjerva, Valldøla, and Tora/Føysa, have their sources in Reinheimen.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{summarizing}} {{clinical experience}} with treating lead poisoning in hunting falcons used in Middle East falconry. In years 1999 and 2000 eighty-five falcons {{expected to be}} exposed to shotgun lead pellets were tested for lead poisoning. Tested falcons were saker falcons (Falco cherrug), peregrine <b>falcons</b> (Falco peregrinus), <b>gyr</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco rusticolus) and their captive bred hybrids. Positive cases were confirmed by 1) present of radiodense heavy metal particles in gastro-intestinal tract, 2) elevated whole blood lead (Pb) level, 3) inhibited delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity. Collected blood samples were analyzed in Dubai Central Veterinary Research Laboratory. 32 % of all tested falcons were negative on lead poisoning. 52 % were sub clinical cases with elevated whole blood Pb level or decreased ALAD activity. 16 % of the falcons had severe symptoms of lead poisoning. Radiogram only in seven falcons (8. 5 %) showed heavy metal particles in ventriculus. Very good treatment success was achieved with repeated (2 - 3 times) regime of 5 % CaEDTA (Calciumedetate), ANIMALCARE (35 mg/kg TID or 50 mg/kg BID) for 5 days. In very severe cases when ALAD activity was 100 % inhibited and blood Pb level exceeded 100 l/l, 80 - 100 mg/kg EDTA i. v. with 20 ml Lactated Ringers solution for 5 days markedly reduced the blood Pb level and the clinical symptoms.

40|$|Wildlife {{forensic}} genetic {{science is}} the application ofmolecular techniques to legal investigations involving animal species. Despite being recognised {{as a useful}} approach in criminal investigations from the late 1980 's, it remains a niche field with research and casework being performed by both trained forensic scientists and academic specialists alike. While human forensic research {{can be used as}} a basis for non-human forensic study, there is a lack offormal forensic recommendations and guidelines in the field which inevitably leads to different practices being adopted. This thesis examines the issues currently associated with wildlife forensic research and casework in the three areas associated with the field; species identification, population assignment and individual identification. An assessment of the utility ofthe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker cytochrome c oxdase I (COl) was undertaken in the form of a forensic validation study. The COl gene has been chosen as a marker for 'DNA barcoding' and the planned expansion ofthe COl database to include reference sequences for all known and newly discovered life would benefit forensic species identification. Validation results demonstrate that sequence similarity searches provide high percentage matches between unknown sample and reference sequences and are suitable for identification purposes where adequate reference sequences exist. A simulated case study reveals that the mtDNA cytochrome b (cyt b) marker performs better than COl due to the larger number ofcyt b species sequences that currently exist. The use of this marker together with cyt b will increase the strength ofgenetic evidence in casework requiring species identification. Where species cannot be differentiated using mtDNA markers, nuclear markers may be employed in conjunction with population assignment tests. Saker (Falco cherrug) and <b>gyr</b> (Falco rusticolus) <b>falcons</b> are currently classified as separate species and receive different levels ofinternational protection. Both species are subject to international trade controls (CITES) and the need for accurate identification for trade monitoring purposes is necessary. The results presented here demonstrate that both species share mtDNA COl haplotypes and display a paraphyletic relationship making these species indistinguishable when using this marker. However, the allele frequencies ofnine nuclear short tandem repeat (STR) loci are variable enough to identify the two species with > 98 % certainty. Despite the high certainty of identification, population assignment techniques such as this are currently limited to monitoring illegal trade and not useable for providing forensic evidence for casework. This is due to the lack ofvalidation associated with assignment tests and future work needs to address this shortcoming. The forensic identification ofindividuals in non-human species has received increasing attention in the last 10 years. While this attention has mainly focussed on commercial and domestic species there is also a need to identify wild individuals. Using the protected Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and six protected raptor species (golden eagle, Aquila chrysaetos, goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, merlin, Falco columbarius, peregrine <b>falcon,</b> F. peregrinus, <b>gyr</b> F. rusticolus and saker falcon F. cherrug), STR loci were validated and screened in representative populations of each species. Validation results suggest that all loci are usable for generating STR profiles in forensic casework although the typing systems in <b>gyr</b> and saker <b>falcons</b> require additional loci to increase their discriminatory ability. This research suggests that the match probability equation allowing for estimates of population substructure (8) and inbreeding if) is currently the most appropriate estimator for individual identification in wildlife species although further work will need to formally assess this.
