40|$|The {{operating}} conditions of urban drainage networks during storm events certainly {{depend on the}} hydraulic conveying capacity of conduits but also on downstream boundary conditions. This is particularly true in costal areas where {{the level of the}} receiving water body is directly or indirectly affected by tidal or wave effects. In such cases, not just different rainfall conditions (varying intensity and duration), but also different sea-levels and their effects on the network operation should be considered. This paper aims to study the behaviour of a seaside town storm sewer network, estimating the threshold condition for flooding and proposing a simplified method to assess the urban flooding severity as a function of either climate variables. The case study is a portion of the drainage system of Rimini (Italy), implemented and numerically modelled by means of InfoWorks CS code. The hydraulic simulation of the sewerage system has therefore allowed to identify the percentage of nodes of the drainage system where flooding is expected to occur.

Our hypothesis was that some patients with PBS/IC have an associated measurable bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) secondary to dysfunctional voiding and that those patients with more severe PBS/IC {{are more likely to}} have BOO. Methods This is a retrospective chart review of female patients diagnosed with PBS/IC based on the NIDDK research <b>definition.</b> <b>Charts</b> were reviewed for clinical symptom severity, ulcer or non-ulcer PBS/IC on cystoscopy, and pressure-flow urodynamics (UDPF). Patients were excluded if they had a urinary infection at the time of urodynamics or did not meet study entry requirements. The cut-off values of ≤ 12 ml/sec and ≥ 25 cm of water was used to define BOO. Results Of the 231 women: 38 had ulcer PBS/IC and 193 had non-ulcer PBS/IC. MCC was 269 ml in non-ulcer PBS/IC and 200 ml in ulcer PBS/IC (P [*]=[*] 0. 006). One hundred eleven women (48 %) met criteria for obstruction. MCC was 298 ml in the non-obstructed group and 214 ml in the obstructed group (P [*]<[*] 0. 0001). The maximum flow with non-ulcer PBS/IC was 11. 0 ml/sec and in ulcer PBS/IC 8. 9 ml/sec (P [*]=[*] 0. 04) Detrusor pressure at maximum flow was 33. 3 cm H 2 O, in non-ulcer, and 37. 4 cm H 2 O in ulcer PBS/IC (P [*]=[*] 0. 01). Conclusions Forty-eight percent of our PBS/IC patients have BOO, and increasing severity of PBS/IC is associated with higher voiding pressure. Neurourol.

40|$|AbstractTraditionally, {{electrical}} resistivity tests {{are being used}} for geophysical characterization but the electrical properties of soils can also be explored for compaction control of geotechnical works. Theoretical relations for estimating the {{electrical resistivity}} can be derived based {{on the degree of}} saturation and can be plotted in a chart relating water content with dry volumetric weight. The curves for specific values of electrical resistivity considering different degrees of saturation and porosities define an electrical resistivity chart, which can be used for compaction control of clayey soils. However the contribution of the water adsorbed in the electrically charged clay minerals surfaces must be considered, as they increase electrical conductivity. This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which the electrical resistivity was measured in different specimens of white kaolin compacted with different voids ratio and molding water contents. Discussion is made over the influence on electrical resistivity of the structure induced by the compaction process. Experimental data allowed defining the resistivity chart for this clay, which differs from the theoretical chart defined based only in the degree of saturation. Considerations are done about how this information can be used in compaction control considering the <b>definition</b> of resistivity <b>charts</b> and different clayey soils...|$|R

Objective: To determine incidence and prevalence rates of IPF in the population of a large Italian region. Methods: in this cross-sectional study study data were collected on all patients of 18 years of age and older admitted as primary or secondary idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (ICD 9 -CM 516. 3) to Lazio hospitals, from 1 / 1 / 2005 to 31 / 12 / 2009, using regional hospital discharge, population and cause of death databases. Reporting accuracy was assessed on a random sample of hospital charts carrying the ICD 9 -CM 516. 3, 516. 8, 516. 9 and 515 codes, by reviewing radiology and pathology findings to define cases as IPF “confident”, “possible” or “inconsistent”. Results: Annual prevalence and incidence of IPF were estimated at 25. 6 per 100, 000 and 7. 5 per 100, 000 using the ICD 9 -CM code 516. 3 without chart audit while they were estimated at 31. 6 per 100, 000 and at 9, 3 per 100, 000 for the IPF “confident” <b>definition</b> after hospital <b>chart</b> audit.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{an extension of}} O. Schramm's SLE processes to complicated plane domains and Riemann surfaces. First, three kinds of new SLEs are defined for simple conformal types. They have properties similar to traditional SLEs. Then harmonic random Loewner chains (HRLC) are defined in finite Riemann surfaces. They are measures on the space of Loewner chains, which are increasing families of closed subsets satisfying certain properties. An HRLC is first defined on local charts using Loewner's equation. Since the <b>definitions</b> in different <b>charts</b> agree with each other, these local HRLCs can be put together to construct a global HRLC. An HRLC in a plane domain can be described by differential equations involving canonical plane domains. Those old and new SLEs are special cases of HRLCs. An HRLC is determined by a parameter [kappa] >= 0, a starting point and a target set. When [kappa] = 6, the HRLC satisfies the locality property. When [kappa] = 2, the HRLC preserves some observable that resembles the observable for the corresponding loop-erased random walk (LERW). So HRLC_ 2 should be the scaling limit of LERW. With reasonable assumptions, HRLC_{ 8 / 3 } differs from a restriction measure by a conformally invariant density; for [kappa] in (0, 8 / 3), HRLC_[kappa] differs from a pre-restriction measure by a conformally invariant density. A restriction measure could be constructed from a pre-restriction measure by adding Brownian bubbles...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of a film or television program is a big financial undertaking and carries a lot of risk. Film production in South Africa is relatively young if compared to overseas. Because {{of the fact that}} the industry is still young and very competitive it has yet to develop a standard set of rules or guidelines. Everyone is doing their own thing, which is fine if a person works alone, but in the {{production of}} a film many different crews from different companies have to work together. They tend to get in each other's way and struggle to communicate. It is often not clear who is responsible for what and this could cause confusion and time delays. The need for a system that will make production more organised and structured in South Africa is a reality. The development of a Quality Management System will benefit the film industry by giving it structure, standard procedures and processes. It will define the responsibilities and compare different technologies through their quality and costs. The Quality Management System will serve as an overall guideline of the production process to people in the industry. A Quality Management System will greatly improve the chances of success for a film and the overall working conditions of the crew during the film production. After an in-depth literature review on the history of quality management, TQM, QMS, ISO 9001, EFQM Excellence Model ® and Process Management the student gained comprehension on the project development, the theory behind the project and the purpose of the project. It became apparent that process mapping, responsibilities of key personnel and documentation will play a big part in the project.

40|$|The City of Rochester, New York, is {{developing}} the {{combined sewer overflow}} and abatement plan (CSOAP) to handle sanitary sewage and storm water. The west side system contains 40 dropshafts along a 26 mile long tunnel. The function of these dropshafts is to transport the water from one elevation and energy level to a lower elevation and energy level. At several locations along the tunnel it is proposed to construct surge shafts to attenuate surge pressures in the system. To minimize construction disturbances at the surface, {{reduce the amount of}} boring and excavation, and consequently reduce the construction costs, the surge shafts have been combined with conventional dropshafts. These combined surge and dropshaft structures would have dual functions of conveying water from the ground surface to the underground tunnels and relieving surge pressures in the system. Conduits at the ground surface collect the water and convey it to a quarter cylinder elbow which deflects the water 90 degrees into a verticalrectangular shaft. The vertical shaft is located inside and at the upstream side of the surge shaft. One wall of the vertical shaft is slotted to provide for air re-entrainment and also pressure relief in the dropshaft. The surge shaft is a large excavated and lined cylinder which extends from the tunnel level to the ground surface. A boot is attached to the surge shaft just below the dropshaft. Attached to the downstream side of the surge shaft is a deaeration chamber containing a slotted weir, false crown with air slots, and a bellmouth entrance to the exit conduit. An air vent is provided along the downstream side of the surge shaft. The water falling through the elbow and vertical shaft entrains considerable air while gaining kinetic energy. The falling water-air mixture impinges {{on the floor of the}} surge shaft. The boot, surge shaft, and deaeration chamber dissipate some of the energy, remove and collect the entrained air, and direct the water at a reduced velocity into the exit conduit. Some of the entrained air is released in the surge shaft and rises directly to the surface. The remaining air rises to the false crown in the deaeration chamber, passes through the air slots into the chamber above, and returns to the upper part of the surge tank through a vent shaft. Part of this return air is then recirculated via the dropshaft air slots and air ramps. A <b>definition</b> sketch (<b>Chart</b> 1) indicates the various shaft components.

They are measures on the space of Loewner chains, which are increasing families of closed subsets satisfying certain properties. An HRLC is first defined on local charts using Loewner’s equation. Since the <b>definitions</b> in different <b>charts</b> agree with each other, these local HRLCs can be put together to construct a global HRLC. An HRLC in a plane domain can be described by differential equations involving canonical plane domains. Those old and new SLEs are special cases of HRLCs. An HRLC is determined by a parameter κ ≥ 0, a starting point and a target set. When κ = 6, the HRLC satisfies the locality property. When κ = 2, the HRLC preserves some observable that resembles the observable for the corresponding looperased random walk (LERW). So HRLC 2 should be the scaling limit of LERW. With reasonable assumptions, HRLC 8 / 3 differs from a restriction measure by a conformally invariant density; for κ ∈ (0, 8 / 3), HRLCκ differs from a pre-restriction measure by a conformally invariant density. A restriction measure could be constructed from a pre-restriction measure by adding Brownian bubbles. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} development and acceptance of standards of bodily and mental “normality” for children in the United States {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century. By paying attention to both societal changes and institutional goals, it seeks to understand why standards and measurements have become essential to modern education and childrearing. It begins with the initial adoption of standards in physical education in the 1880 s and then looks at how these ideals of normality informed the school hygiene movement and educational psychology. Efforts to develop normal standards of growth and development were inspired by perceived crises in normality related to industrialization, urbanization and immigration. Standards were seen as a way to stabilize the “American race” but they were also desirable because they promised to individualize children in systematic and objective ways so that they could be easily sorted within large school systems. ^ The adoption of normality as an ideal reflected a new understanding of children as biological resources that had economic and political value. Children were encouraged to be physically and mentally normal because they were both components of school systems and future workers. School systems first adopted physical standards for examining children in order to reduce financial burden of “laggards” who could not complete the standard curriculum by age fourteen. This use of physical norms convinced educators that “normal” children were desirable and efficient and set important precedents for the later adoption of mental testing. ^ As more children were being assessed as “normal” or “abnormal,” the definition of normality began to take on an “objective,” quantitative meaning. In the mid-nineteenth century, “normal” was equated with “natural. ” By the early twentieth century it was the “average” and all children were expected to fall at mathematically defined places in relation to it. This <b>definition,</b> and the <b>charts</b> and tables that were based on it, assumed that most children were not normal. Yet, reformers used the new standards of normality as ideals and sought to convince Americans that all children could and should be made normal. ...|$|R

Meanwhile, several well-known – yet distinct – initiatives within the OER world continue to purport {{a mission of}} education as a ‘public good’. In addition current thinking as well as emerging United Kingdom (UK) and international policy agendas on education are shifting {{from the idea of}} simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating ‘open participatory learning ecosystems’ (cf. Smith and Casserly, 2006; Seely-Brown 2007; Seely-Brown & Adler 2008). At the core of these evolutionary trajectories of OER mediation, the notion of community and participation become more complex. Put simply, an OER community might consist of those who collaborate to create or reuse OER content. Alternatively a community may be formed by interactions between tutors and peers aggregating in the study and creative adaptation of particular OER units. Likewise, as the landscape of OER becomes more diversified (comprising of initiatives coming from both established educational institutions and from ‘alternative’ or informal social constellations of interest and practice), so does the configuration of social production of content in learning environments. The question then arises as to the appropriateness of community building tools or mediating artefacts that address different audiences’ inscriptions or goals to facilitate engagement. To address these questions we first <b>chart</b> <b>definitions</b> of, and affordances surrounding participation and community engagement in a diverse body of OER initiatives. Secondly, deploying Engeström’s framework on social production as a new landscape for learning (2007), we draw on a number of interviews with OER professionals and volunteers as well as on insights on learner behaviour to offer a mapping of learning situations across ‘informal’/’formal’ public spaces. We conclude by problematising the notion of collaborative communities or ‘relational networks’ within an OER context and by proposing a framework that takes into account a number of boundary issues concerning design of original and OER content (Wilson, 2007), and peer-production of content, including expertise, locus of agency and pedagogy (Conole et al., in press). ...|$|R
