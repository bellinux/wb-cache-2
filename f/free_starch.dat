40|$|Entrapment of starch {{granules}} within cassava parenchyma cells {{constitutes a}} major challenge in starch extraction from cassava tuber. This was addressed by applying cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes coupled with spontaneous lactic acid bacteria fermentation in the pre-treatment of wet milled cassava. The hydrolytic activities of the enzymes and pH lowering by the fermentation resulted in fragmentation of the cassava cell walls, with improved release of <b>free</b> <b>starch</b> granules. The residual cell wall material after the treatments was characterized by microscopy and gas chromatography. Lignified material was resistant to hydrolysis. Material that was not hydrolysed by the enzymes consisted of arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose and glucose, with the latter two the most abundant. It appears that the gums and hemicelluloses were hydrolysed first, enabling subsequent hydrolysis of the cellulosic materials.

Compared with the cutting mill, grinding samples through the abrasion mill increased the precision of starch measures in silage, likely due to the effect of the finer particle size produced by the abrasion mill allowing more accurate subsampling of a more homogeneous matrix. Starch values were greater for grain ground with an abrasion mill than with a cutting mill, with the difference greater for dry-rolled than for high-moisture corn.

40|$|In {{this work}} we studied {{the effect of}} malonic acid {{concentration}} on the Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction both in absence and in presence of starch, which acts as indicator for the iodine intermediate. For the <b>starch</b> <b>free</b> mixtures, the number of oscillations and the oscillation time increased {{with the increase of}} initial malonic acid concentration, while the period time showed the opposite trend. When starch was also present in the Briggs-Rauscher mixture, the number of oscillations, the oscillation time and period length were higher in comparison with the <b>starch</b> <b>free</b> mixtures with the same initial malonic acid concentration. In presence of starch, within one oscillation period, the iodine consumption segment was also longer compared to those measured for the <b>starch</b> <b>free</b> mixtures. This suggests that the starch is not only a simple visual indicator for the iodine intermediate, but it probably acts as a reservoir for iodine due to the starch-triiodide equilibrium during each oscillation cycle. As such, the starch may influence the kinetics of the reaction steps involving the iodine intermediate. Finally, we present a simple method for the treatment of the residual Briggs-Rauscher mixture which enables the removal of the strong acid, the oxidizing agents and the quantitative recovery of the Mn 2 + catalyst in form of MnO 2. Thereby, this method enables to minimize the environmental effect of the residual mixture before disposing it...|$|R

In contrast, flours from raw seeds contained {{a large number}} of <b>free</b> <b>starch</b> granules. The in vitro a-amylolysis rate ofPCFs was remarkably low, but increased after physical and chemical treatments of the flours. Homogenization resulted in the largest increase of hydrolysis rate. The susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis was also enhanced when PCFs were preincubated with pepsin or submitted to additional boiling. These treatments promoted evident alterations in the microscopic appearance of the cotyledon cell walls of the PCFs, changes that ranged from an apparently thinner surface (pepsin effect), to an almost complete disruption (homogenization effect). A flour prepared from boiled and vacuum-dried red beans showed Jess structural integrity and greater rate of amylolysis than the corresponding PCF, indicating that the drying procedure may influence the microstructural and digestibility features of precooked legumi nous materials. Neither cell walls nor starch granules were observed after suspending PCFs in 2 N KOH, giving support to the use of alkaline pre-treatment for the evaluation of to tal starch content of PCFs by enzymatic procedures. The present results suggest the persistence of starch granules enclosed in cotyledon cells as a primary reason for the limited enzymatic availability of starch in PCFs...|$|E

Different particle size fractions of starch acetate were mixed with caffeine (22 % V/V) to obtain various mixture organisations in the powder, as 14 {{well as in the}} final tablet. The organisation of powder mixtures was calculated by the carrier payload of starch acetate particles, while the pore size distributions in tablets were measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry. A carrier payload below I indicated the existence of a <b>free</b> <b>starch</b> acetate particle surface, while numbers greater than 1 pointed to a complete occupation of the starch acetate particle surface area by caffeine particles. The carrier payload calculations gave a good prediction for the existence of a starch acetate matrix in the tablet structures. Caffeine matrices in tablets compressed from the mixtures could be detected by mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements. The existence of different matrices, as well as different pore networks, determined the physical changes of the tablets and {{the release mechanism}} of caffeine during dissolution tests. When a tablet contained only a caffeine matrix, rapid tablet disintegration and immediate release of the total amount of caffeine occurred. A single matrix of starch acetate resulted in tablets that remained intact, although cracks were formed. The co-existence of matrices of both materials created surface erosion of the tablet. The caffeine release profiles of tablets that remained intact or showed erosion were fitted by an equation containing both diffusional and relaxational factors to describe the effect of tablet porosity on drug release.

In some instances strip formation was unsatisfactory, {{in other instances}} blistering of the snack occurred on frying. In total, about 20 - 25 batches of potato granules were examined and classified in relation to these two phenomena. The amylose/amylopectin ratios of these samples of potato granules were determined by the semi-micro potentiometric iodine titration technique, but {{it was found that}} there was no significant differences in the amylose/amylopectin ratio in relation to the extrusion behaviour of the granules. The determination of the amount of <b>free</b> <b>starch</b> present outside the potato granules also did not show any clear differences between the satisfactory and unsatisfactory potato granules, though the extract from the unsatisfactory potato granules tended to indicate that they contained more lipid than the satisfactory ones. The unsatisfactory potato granules yielded a higher amount of total extractable soluble starch than their satisfactory counterpart, for the same variety of potato granules. The amount of soluble starch increased on extrusion and it was also found {{to be related to the}} breaking strength of the extrudate and their blistering behaviour. A stronger strip which gave a higher amount of soluble starch possessed a greater tendency to blister. Addition of PSA additives to potato granules prior to extrusion increased the soluble starch content, but the degree of blistering was suppressed. Gel permeation chromatography experiments showed that the starches extracted from inside the potato granules consisted of mostly high molecular weight macromolecules (very similar to that of amylopectin) and a smaller quantity of low molecular weight macromolecules similar to amylose. The soluble starch extracted from the outside of potato granules also consisted of a greater amount of high molecular weight macromolecules whereas, after extrusion, a greater quantity of smaller molecular weight macromolecules was found to be present which presumably had been expressed from the granules and was assisting in forming the network, binding the potato granules together to form a coherent strip. Determination of the total phosphate and glucose- 6 -phosphate contents of both potato granules and extracted starches did not show any correlation between the satisfactory and unsatisfactory potato granules.

30|$|The thermal {{degradation}} temperature of starch under three different pHs {{in the presence}} of FA-functionalized ferrite is shown in Fig.  3. Figure  3 d exhibits a thermogram corresponding to the starch treated under acidic pH. The thermogram exhibited a three-step degradation process. The first minor weight loss below 100  °C is accounted for by the removal of moisture and physisorbed water molecules. The second minor weight loss around 250  °C is demonstrated by the removal of chemisorbed water molecules and some amount of FA from the nanocomposite structure. The third major weight loss around 500  °C is responsible for the degradation of starch backbone. After the complete degradation, above 750  °C, it shows that 16  % weight residue remained. The percentage of weight residue that remained above 750  °C is directly proportional to the amount of ferrite present in the nanocomposite system. Figure  3 e remembers the TGA thermogram of starch nanocomposite treated under alkaline pH. Again the thermogram exhibits a four-step degradation process. The first and second minor weight loss up to 130  °C is covered by the removal of moisture and physisorbed water molecules. The third minor weight loss around 250  °C is due to the removal of chemisorbed water molecules. The fourth minor weight loss around 750  °C is due to the starch backbone degradation. Above 750  °C it shows 52  % of the remaining weight residue. This confirmed the stable structure of O− Na+ like ionic form of starch. Figure  3 f shows the TGA thermogram of starch treated under neutral pH with the three-step degradation process. The first minor weight loss up to 230  °C is demonstrated by the removal of moisture and physisorbed water molecules. A major weight loss around 300  °C is due to the removal of chemisorbed water molecules and the <b>free</b> <b>starch</b> molecules degradation. The third major weight loss at 518  °C is explained by the degradation of starch backbone. Above 750  °C it gives 10  % weight residue that remained. On close comparison, the alkaline-treated starch exhibited higher thermal stability due to the presence of ionic structure. The weight loss of around 250 – 300  °C is associated with the complex process including the dehydration of saccharide rings and depolymerization [18]. We agree with the results of Piyada et al. [18] under acidic and neutral pH, but in the alkaline pH, the structure of starch becomes different.|$|E
40|$|Diversification {{in the use}} of cassava and sorghum through {{commercial}} processing into value-added food and beverage products is an important means of developing the economies of African countries. However, potential applications of cassava and sorghum are limited by their unique structural properties and chemical composition attributes. With cassava tuber, its high fibrous material content constitutes a problem after starch hydrolysis in brewing. These cell wall materials (CWM) have high water holding capacity (85 - 90 %), which results in poor wort filtration. Cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzyme treatment of cassava cake resulted in a reduction in total solids volume and in the amount of insoluble solids. The amount of <b>free</b> <b>starch</b> granules also increased with increase in enzyme concentration. Combination of different enzyme preparations showed a synergistic effect by significantly reducing the viscosity of the cassava cake (milled cassava tuber). These effects appear to be due to complementary enzyme activities that hydrolyse the parenchyma polymer cell walls, except for the lignified materials. As determined by GC, the residual CWM monosaccharide units consisted of arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, galactose and glucose, with glucose being the most sugar units followed by xylose. This suggests that cellulosic type material is the main components of cassava CWM. The application of tannin sorghum in beverage production is limited due to the condensed tannins interacting with other grain components, which negatively affects the processing functionality and nutritional properties of the beverages. Type II and III tannin sorghums were selected for investigation of tannin inactivation through steeping the flours in 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 % alkaline (NaOH) solution. Tannin inactivation was also investigated by admixing with soy protein isolate. Sodium hydroxide steeping of the flour resulted in a substantial reduction in assayable total phenols and tannins. The effect of NaOH on the tannins in the Type III sorghum also resulted in 60 - 80 % reduction in α-amylase enzyme inhibition by the tannins. SPI treatment of Type III resulted in 76 % reduction in α-amylase inhibition by tannins. Fermentability of the Type III sorghum by lactic acid bacteria improved with NaOH steeping. Applying this treatment in a mashing process resulted in a considerable reduction in starch liquefaction time with the Type III sorghum. The normal phase HPLC profile of the tannin molecules based on the degree of polymerisation showed an increase in the polymeric tannins with the NaOH treatment. LC/MS identified procyanidins ranging from dimer to hexamer in the NaOH treated Type II flour. These procyanidins were not identified in the Type III, which indicates tannin polymerisation in both Type II and III tannin sorghums to higher polymeric proanthocyanidins. The polymerisation mechanism is proposed to be by cross-linking of the tannin molecules resulting in the formation of higher proanthocyanidin polymers. These polymerised tannins are less reactive with amylases resulting in too large tannin polymers, which can be attributed to reduction in the availaible phenolic group reactive site. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cassava CWM will improve processing application of cassava in brewing. Sodium hydroxide pre-treatment of Type III sorghum flour will improve its processing functionality for increase utilisation in beverage production. The creation of new markets for these crops should help ensure sustainable food security through economic empowerment of the small-holder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.

As the lipid is set <b>free</b> after <b>starch</b> gelatinization, {{it is assumed that}} it complexes with amylose leached outside the granule, whereas additional pure GMS can probably to a greater extent complex inside the granule. Semicrystalline complexes could be considered as inert mass in the starch systems as their melting temperature exceeded the temperature reached during the experiment. The additives also impacted starch's sensitivity to enzymatic degradation. GMS addition reduced the resistant starch (RS) content of the gels and increased their hydrolysis index (HI). Added amorphous or semicrystalline complexes, on the other hand, yielded gels with a higher RS content and a lower HI. Addition of amylose-lipid complexes to starch suspensions impacts starch gel characteristics and decreases its digestion rate, possibly by releasing short amylose chains in a controlled way that then participate in amylose crystallization and, hence, RS formation...|$|R
40|$|Three {{varieties}} of oil seeds (brassica, sesame and linseed) {{have been studied}} for a comparative data on their chemical composition and nutritive value. Moisture and ash content of different varieties are not very different but their oil contents vary significantly. Among these three sesame seed contains {{the highest percentage of}} oil (43. 0 %). All varieties contain a reasonable amount of protein (25 - 35 %), <b>starch,</b> <b>free</b> sugar, reducing sugar, crude fibre, inorganic materials and vitamin-C. Physical properties, such as specific gravity and refractive index are very similar. Saponification value, acid value, iodine value and peroxide value for these seed oils were also determined. Brassica seed oil and linseed oil are edible because of their low acid values (1. 06 - 1. 42) but sesame seed oil is not due to high acid value (9. 80...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} of phylloxera-grapevine interactions {{could contribute to}} new control strategies. Using potted vine and in vitro dual cultures, we see that root gall (nodosity) formation on Vitis vinifera is accompanied by accumulation of <b>starch,</b> <b>free</b> amino acids and amides, indicating formation of a nutrient sink. Steady state levels {{of a wide range}} of RNA transcripts remain unaltered, suggesting that if there is a molecular response to phylloxera attack, it is either transient or restricted to only a few cells. Lower reproductive rates of phylloxera on Ramsey (V. champini) correlate with a lack of starch accumulation in root galls. Feeding attempts on V. riparia and Börner result in rapid necrosis of root tissue. No feeding attempts have been observed on V. rotundifolia. Transgenic plants and ‘hairy roots’ expressing promoter-reporter gene constructs encoding, for example, GFP or GUS, are being used to examine phylloxera-root interactions in situ.

5000|$|Mashing {{converts}} the starches released {{during the}} malting stage into sugars {{that can be}} fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed {{together to create a}} cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This [...] "conversion" [...] is called saccharification. The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or [...] "wort", which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as lautering. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about 75 - 78 C (known as a mashout) to <b>free</b> up more <b>starch</b> and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as sparging).|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric carbon-dioxide {{enrichment}} {{is known}} to affect the yield of lettuce and radish grown in controlled environments, but {{little is known about}} CO 2 enrichment effects on the chemical composition of lettuce and radish. These crops are useful model systems for a Controlled Ecological Life-Support System (CELSS), largely because of their relatively short production cycles. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivar 'Waldmann's Green' and radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cultivar 'Giant White Globe' were grown both in the field and in controlled environments, where hydroponic nutrient solution, light, and temperature were regulated, and where CO 2 levels were controlled at 400, 1000, 5000, or 10, 000 ppm. Plants were harvested at maturity, dried, and analyzed for proximate composition (protein, fat, ash, and carbohydrate), total nitrogen (N), nitrate N, <b>free</b> sugars, <b>starch,</b> total dietary fiber, and minerals. Total N, protein N, nonprotein N (NPN), and nitrate N generally increased for radish roots and lettuce leaves when grown under growth chamber conditions compared to field conditions. The nitrate-N level of lettuce leaves, as a percentage of total NPN, decreased with increasing levels of CO 2 enrichment. The ash content of radish roots and of radish and lettuce leaves decreased with increasing levels of CO 2 enrichment. The levels of certain minerals differed between field- and chamber-grown materials, including changes in the calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) contents of radish and lettuce leaves, resulting in reduced Ca/P ratio for chamber-grown materials. The free-sugar contents were similar between the field and chamber-grown lettuce leaves, but total dietary fiber content was much higher in the field-grown plant material. The starch content of growth-chamber lettuce increased with CO 2 level...|$|R
40|$|Properties of {{irradiated}} starches {{have been}} outlined in this review. 2 ̆ 7) 2 ̆ 7 -radiation generates <b>free</b> radicals on <b>starch</b> molecules which cause changes in starch properties. The intensity of free radicals {{is dependent upon}} starch moisture content, and temperature and duration of storage. Increasing dosages of -y-irradiation creates in creasing intensities of free radicals on carbohydrates. These free radicals are responsible for bringing about molecular changes and fragmentation of starch molec ules. Increasing 2 ̆ 7) 2 ̆ 7 -irradiation dosages cause an in crease in acidity, and decreases in viscosity and water solubility of starches. The granule structure remains visually undamaged at low dosages of irradiation, but may suffer severe damage at higher dosages (100 kGy). Safety of irradiated foods continues to remain a subject of public concern. Studies have shown that irradiated foods are toxicologically and chemically safe for human consumption. Irradiation of starchy foods can be controlled to bring about required changes beneficial to the industry, {{and at the same}} time provide wholesome food to the consumers...|$|R
