50|$|Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) is a {{closed-loop}} dynamic power minimization {{technique that}} reduces power {{based on the}} actual operating conditions of the chip, i.e., the power consumption is continuously adjusted during the run time of the chip. Typically the design of any chip is done {{in such a way}} that it meets most demanding application throughput requirements under worst case operating conditions. This leads to an <b>excess</b> <b>margin</b> or wastage of power because the chip usually operates under typical operating conditions. AVS is beneficial compared to the conventional Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) approach, a commonly encountered open loop dynamic power minimization technique, because AVS eliminates the excess power margins that are present in the open loop DVS systems due to the fixed voltage-frequency relations employed in those systems. In AVS technique the chip's exact process corner is determined either during the manufacturing test or during runtime and the appropriate Voltage-Frequency relationship is determined, which will be used during the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling operations. This eliminates the extra margin that will be present if the worst case operating conditions are taken into account while the chip is actually operating under typical conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—VLSI {{circuits}} usually allocate <b>excess</b> <b>margin</b> {{to account}} for worst-case process variation. Since most chips are fabricated at process conditions better than the worst-case corner, adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) is commonly used to reduce power consumption whenever possible. A typical AVS setup relies on a performance monitor that replicates critical paths of the circuit to guide voltage scaling. However, {{it is difficult to}} define appropriate critical paths for an SoC which has multiple operating modes and IPs. In this paper, we propose a different methodology for AVS which matches the voltage scaling characteristics of a circuit rather than the delays of critical paths. This fundamental change in monitoring strategy simplifies the monitoring circuitry as well as the calibration flow of conventional monitoring methods. To enable the proposed methodology, we study voltage scaling characteristics of digital circuits. Based on our analyses, we develop design guidelines as well as design monitoring circuits which have tunable voltage scaling characteristics. Our experimental results show that this methodology can be used for AVS with a simplified calibration flow. I...|$|E

40|$|Access to Space {{for small}} R 2 ̆ 6 D {{payloads}} {{is one of}} the key enablers for innovative space technology development. For a vibrant space R 2 ̆ 6 D environment to exist space access needs to be available on a regular basis at a cost commensurate with R 2 ̆ 6 D program budgets and with a minimum of custom interface requirements. The United States has a long heritage of developing new technologies for space applications, enabled by numerous space launches in the early 1960 s. Many space experiments are launched as secondary payloads due to their relatively small mass and modest program budgets. NASA and DoD have organized processes to evaluate and select experimental payloads for space access (such as the DOD Space Test Program’s SERB). The payload interfaces are usually custom-made for each payload and are scheduled on a case-by-case basis depending on primary payload <b>excess</b> <b>margins</b> and acceptance of secondary payloads. The International space community has taken a dramatically different approach since the early 1990 s with the introduction of a regularly scheduled standardized launch interface for secondary payloads – the Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP). Nearly 30 free-flyer secondary payloads have been launched from ASAP since its introduction over 10 years ago. In comparison, the US STP program has only launched an average of 1 free-flyer per year since its inception in 1965. Is this disparity in secondary payload launch rates a cause for concern for the US space R 2 ̆ 6 D community? Is the US losing ground to the International space community as a leader in the introduction of new space technologies? Regularly available space access is a key factor in the rapid introduction of new space technologies.

In this paper, we analyze {{the most widely used}} regulatory mechanisms aimed at achieving this goal, i. e. feed-in tari¤s and mandatory portfolio standards.

The optimal feed-in tari ¤ exceeds the marginal cost of the conventional technology if and only if there are signi 8 ̆ 5 cant economies of scale. In this case, an increase in the marginal cost of conventional technology (e. g. incorporation of social costs of GHG emissions) implies a reduction in the optimal feed-in tari¤. The RPS standard that induces optimal investment in renewables further exacerbates under-investment in the conventional technology. A lower capacity margin in the conventional technology induces higher spot prices (on average) which serve to recoup the losses associated with socially optimal investment levels in the renewable technology. Given that regulators are generally averse to low <b>excess</b> capacity <b>margins,</b> an RPS standard is bound to co-exist with other regulatory interventions aimed at maintaining acceptable capacity margins (e. g. capacity market). 1...|$|R

A neutronic evaluation of the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor (TAMU NSCR) using the General Atomic Company (GA) low enrichment uranium (LEU 30 - 20 fuel was performed to determine the feasibility of this type of fuel.

It also reviews bank interest rate spreads and profit margins, and their determinants, and compares such spreads with those prevailing in other regions of the world.

40|$|Ternary content {{addressable}} memories (TCAMs) are hardware-based parallel {{lookup tables}} with bit-level masking capability. They are attractive for {{applications such as}} packet forwarding and classification in network routers. Despite the attractive features of TCAMs, high power consumption {{is one of the}} most critical challenges faced by TCAM designers. This work proposes circuit techniques for reducing TCAM power consumption. The main contribution of this work is divided in two parts: (i) reduction in match line (ML) sensing energy, and (ii) static-power reduction techniques. The ML sensing energy is reduced by employing (i) positive-feedback ML sense amplifiers (MLSAs), (ii) low-capacitance comparison logic, and (iii) low-power ML-segmentation techniques. The positive-feedback MLSAs include both resistive and active feedback to reduce the ML sensing energy. A body-bias technique can further improve the feedback action at the expense of additional area and ML capacitance. The measurement results of the active-feedback MLSA show 50 - 56 % reduction in ML sensing energy. The measurement results of the proposed low-capacitance comparison logic show 25 % and 42 % reductions in ML sensing energy and time, respectively, which can further be improved by careful layout. The low-power ML-segmentation techniques include dual ML TCAM and charge-shared ML. Simulation results of the dual ML TCAM that connects two sides of the comparison logic to two ML segments for sequential sensing show 43 % power savings for a small (4 %) trade-off in the search speed. The charge-shared ML scheme achieves power savings by partial recycling of the charge stored in the first ML segment. Chip measurement results show that the charge-shared ML scheme results in 11 % and 9 % reductions in ML sensing time and energy, respectively, which can be improved to 19 - 25 % by using a digitally controlled charge sharing time-window and a slightly modified MLSA. The static power reduction is achieved by a dual-VDD technique and low-leakage TCAM cells. The dual-VDD technique trades-off the <b>excess</b> noise <b>margin</b> of MLSA for smaller cell leakage by applying a smaller VDD to TCAM cells and a larger VDD to the peripheral circuits. The low-leakage TCAM cells trade off the speed of READ and WRITE operations for smaller cell area and leakage. Finally, design and testing of a complete TCAM chip are presented, and compared with other published designs...|$|R
30|$|This {{modeling}} approach {{provides a}} reasonably good {{reproduction of the}} shape of the basement at the end of active extension but fails to predict the depth of the basin very accurately. Figure  4 b shows the prediction that the Moresby Seamount, a structural high {{in the middle of the}} rift basin, should rise slightly above sea level, as should some of the structural highs located around the 20 -km mark on the profile. Instead, Fig.  4 a shows the reality in that neither of these features comes close to sea level, but mostly lies around 1  km water depth. This mismatch is a robust result that changes slightly depending on how the faults are interpreted on the seismic image but does not disappear if the angle of dip is adjusted or the geometry changed from being planar to listric. How then do we explain the discrepancy between the model and the observed bathymetry? Figure  4 c proposes one solution in which the degree of extension in the lower crust would be much higher than that seen in the upper brittle part of the plate. In order to generate additional subsidence extra extension would be required in order to thin the lithospheric plate. This would allow isostacy to cause the high amounts of subsidence observed. Although dynamic effects related to subduction might also explain some of the subsidence anomaly seen in the Woodlark Rift (Lithgow-Bertelloni and Gurnis 1997). I suggest that this example follows the behavior seen in the South China Sea in a similar tectonic setting and forms part of a wider pattern of <b>excess</b> subsidence in <b>margin</b> rift settings associated with break-up.|$|R
