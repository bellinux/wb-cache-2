5|$|A {{number of}} scoring systems <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> help with diagnosis; however, their use is {{controversial}} due to insufficient accuracy. The modified Centor criteria are {{a set of}} five criteria; the total score indicates {{the probability of a}} streptococcal infection.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of MTBI {{is based}} on {{physical}} and neurological examination findings, duration of unconsciousness (usually less than 30minutes) and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA; usually less than 24hours), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (MTBI sufferers have scores of 13 to 15).

25|$|The University of Kentucky Student Government Association (UKSGA) {{represents}} all undergraduate, {{graduate and}} professional students {{enrolled at the}} university in several critical ways. UKSGA <b>exists</b> <b>to</b> increase student influence over academic policy and to provide many helpful, creative and necessary student services. UKSGA also <b>exists</b> <b>to</b> protect and expand student substantive and procedural rights with the university and surrounding municipalities. Finally, UKSGA <b>exists</b> <b>to</b> better represent the student body in relations with faculty, administration, Board of Trustees and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.|$|R
5|$|Horses {{finished}} with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions.

5|$|In some localities {{significant}} bait fisheries <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> supply sport fishermen.

Lesions can be extra-axial, (occurring {{within the}} skull but {{outside of the}} brain) or intra-axial (occurring within the brain tissue). Damage from TBI can be focal or diffuse, confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner, respectively. However, {{it is common for}} both types of injury to exist in a given case.|$|E

5|$|The {{highway is}} four lanes through Saskatchewan from the Alberta {{boundary}} to {{just west of}} Floral; {{the rest of the}} road is two lanes, but plans <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> twin the route and gain expressway status. Similarly, Highway 16, the continuation of the highway into Manitoba, is also to be twinned and become an expressway. The road also serves as part of the Circle Drive in Saskatoon.|$|E

5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E

5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E
5|$|Concourse D was {{constructed}} as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities. All American Eagle flights operated out of Concourse D until, as a cost-cutting measure after 9/11, all American Eagle flights {{were moved to}} Concourse C to share gates with American Airlines. For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> expand Concourse D with additional gates to increase capacity and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E
5|$|Currently, major Italian opera theaters {{maintain}} ballet companies. They <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> provide incidental {{and ceremonial}} dancing in many operas, such as Aida or La Traviata. These dance companies usually maintain a separate ballet season and perform the standard repertoire of classical ballet, little {{of which is}} Italian. The Italian equivalent of the Russian Bolshoi Ballet and similar companies that exist only to perform ballet, independent of a parent opera theater is La Scala Ballet, which is {{under the direction of}} Frèdèric Olivieri. Since 1979 there has existed in Italy a modern dance company, the Aterballetto, based in Reggio Emilia. The company performs worldwide under the leadership of choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti.|$|E

5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|God must be good, Paley argues, {{because in}} many cases the designs seen in nature are beneficial, and because animals {{perceive}} pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of gout which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world.|$|E
5|$|In pre-contact times, natives {{traveling}} up Mauna Kea {{were probably}} guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as {{no evidence of}} the latter has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain <b>exist</b> <b>to</b> this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.|$|E
