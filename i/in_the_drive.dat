5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> to attain a 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition. While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, {{the decision was made}} to deactivate the four recommissioned Iowa-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.|$|E
5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards until late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E

5|$|In September the {{regiment}} {{was sent to}} Italy {{with the rest of}} the division and fought in the Moro River Campaign on the Adriatic coast in December. The division fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino, for which Div Cav provided support. The regiment then participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> on the Gothic Line, where elements entered Florence in August. In October it was reorganised as the Divisional Cavalry Battalion, an infantry unit, because its armoured cars were unsuitable for Italian terrain. The battalion fought in the final Allied offensive in Italy, Operation Grapeshot, during early 1945. It reached Trieste in the first week of May and was stationed there until February 1946. That month the Divisional Cavalry deployed to Japan, once again as a regiment. Stationed in southern Kyushu, it was disbanded on 1 September 1947.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Williams capped a {{brilliant}} {{first season with}} a record-setting game, running for two touchdowns and 117 yards to become Virginia Tech’s single-season rushing leader with 1,655 yards. Williams had long runs of 21 and 32 yards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> before setting the record on a 6-yard run to the 3. Williams also set Atlantic Coast Conference records with 21 rushing touchdowns and 22 total touchdowns this season breaking North Carolina’s Don McCauley ACC marks of 19 rushing touchdowns and 21 total in 1970. Tennessee’s star running back, Montario Hardesty, could {{not keep up with}} Williams as the Volunteers’ senior had 18 carries for 39 yards and a touchdown. The Hokies outrushed Tennessee 229-5. Taylor completed 10 of 17 passes for 201 yards with an interception. Crompton completed 15 of 26 passes for 235 yards with a touchdown and an interception.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} quarter ended in a {{scoreless}} tie, Georgia scored their first touchdown {{early in the second}} quarter. The 19-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Murray to Jay Rome was set up by a fake punt earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> that gave the Bulldogs a 7–0 lead. After each team again traded punts, Alabama drove the ball to the Bulldogs' one-yard line. However, Eddie Lacy fumbled on second down and then McCarron threw an interception in the endzone to Sanders Commings to end the drive. The Crimson Tide forced another punt on the next Bulldogs possession and Alabama responded on the drive that ensued with their first touchdown of the game on a 41-yard Lacy run that tied the game 7–7. On the next drive, Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted a Murray pass and returned it to the Georgia 47-yard line with just over 1:00 left in the half. Five plays later, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 22-yard field goal as time expired and gave the Crimson Tide a 10–7 halftime lead.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out into the replacement of air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> tube of a reflected shock tunnel by an N 2 O/N 2 mixture {{in order to increase}} the test time. The incident shock velocities were between 2 and 3 km/sec. Test times were estimated from light emission histories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> tube (at distance of L/D = 46. 5 from the main diaphragm) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nozzle at an area ratio of 27. 9 and from pressure histories just upstream of the nozzle entrance (at L/D = 54). The test times estimated from the light emission histories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> tube showed that consistent increases of 60 - 100 % were obtained upon substituting N 2 O/N 2 for air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> tube. These increases were in very good agreement with theoretical estimates. The test times estimated from the light emission histories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nozzle or pressure histories at the nozzle inlet showed significant improvements with N 2 O/N 2 only for cases where the facility was operated at substantially overtailored conditions. It is believed that {{this is due to the}} greater stability of the driver-driven interface at overtailored operating conditions. At overtailored operating conditions, test times increases of 60 - 100 % with N 2 O/N 2 were observed with all three diagnostic techniques. These increases were in reasonable agreement with theoretical estimates...|$|R
5|$|He participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> through France and {{was wounded}} in Aachen, Germany and was sent to England to recover. After he recovered, he rejoined the front lines reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and was given a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant. By April 18, 1945, he was a first lieutenant in command of Company A, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th Army. On that day, he led his company in their advance through Nuremberg, Germany, and single-handedly engaged German forces several times. As his unit passed a city square, a German machine gun opened fire, causing several casualties. Daly rushed the position and killed the three gunners. Advancing ahead of his men, he came across a German patrol preparing to use rocket launchers to ambush American tanks. He again attacked alone and, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, killed all six patrol members. When a machine gun opened fire at close range, {{he picked up a}} dead man's rifle and killed the two-man German crew. On April 19, he was shot through the head; a bullet entered at his ear and exited from the opposite cheek. He was sent to England and eventually the United States to recuperate. At about the same time, his father, who had been wounded in France, was also being evacuated to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} Kibble-Zurek scaling describes <b>the</b> scaling behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics {{across a}} single critical region. In this paper, we study <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics across an overlapping critical region, {{in which a}} critical region (Region-A) is overlaid by another critical region (Region-B). We develop a hybridized Kibble-Zurek scaling (HKZS) to characterize <b>the</b> scaling behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> process. According to <b>the</b> HKZS, <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overlapping region can be described by the critical theories for both Region-A and Region-B simultaneously. This results in a constraint on <b>the</b> scaling function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overlapping critical region.

We numerically confirm the HKZS by simulating <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics <b>in</b> this overlapping region. <b>The</b> HKZSs <b>in</b> other models are also discussed.
