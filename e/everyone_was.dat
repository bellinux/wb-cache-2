5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, {{and maybe a}} short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” and <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> moved by it.|$|E
5|$|However, not <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> {{satisfied}} with the new liturgical and political directions of the AFM. Wessel's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors, {{the loss of the}} majority of the English membership, and a major division of Afrikaner members who did not share his political views. These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, they broke from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E

5|$|Machete {{turned out}} to be more of a success at the box office than Grindhouse, {{grossing}} $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> free, they could begin shooting.|$|E
5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E
5|$|As {{the members}} of the brigade began to return to Australia after the war, he became {{increasingly}} depressed. Eventually, he called a parade to hand out some last medals, and gave them a farewell speech to thank them for upholding his demanding standards. They were then dismissed and he returned to his paperwork. Later that afternoon, the brigade returned to his chateau preceded by bands and colours. Each company circled the chateau and cheered for their commander. Lastly, the senior colonel called for three cheers and told Elliott that the men wanted to show their appreciation for him and that, despite it being a voluntary march, <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> there. He was mentioned in despatches twice more, and awarded the French Croix de guerre.|$|E

5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of {{thousands}} of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong community, <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> {{regarded}} as ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi {{to leave the}} body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. <b>Everyone</b> <b>was</b> dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E

5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. <b>Everyone</b> <b>was</b> placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Under communism, <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> {{guaranteed}} employment. However, women {{suffered the}} double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest {{challenge}} was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, he learned about project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> working on the game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E
