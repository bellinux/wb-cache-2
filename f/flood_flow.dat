Some recent catastrophes include the inundations of Nîmes (France) in 1998 and Vaison-la-Romaine (France) in 1992, the flooding of New Orleans (USA) in 2005, and the flooding in Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Brisbane during the 2010–2011 summer in Queensland (Australia). Flood flows in urban environments have been studied relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events. Some recent research has considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas.|$|E

Through Dudbridge, the channel has been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the Environment Agency. Water from the Slad Brook, which is culverted beneath Stroud, joins the Thames and Severn Canal a short distance above Lower Wallbridge Lock, the first on that canal, while the Painswick Stream joins above the Dudbridge locks, and the Ruscombe Brook joins between the two locks. The top gates of the locks were replaced with concrete dams, which maintained the water level at normal flows around [...] lower than the navigable levels. Below the A419 Dudbridge Road bridge, the water was discharged into the River Frome. As a consequence of its flood relief function, the channel here is classified as a [...] "main river". Designs for reinstatement of the canal have had to accommodate large flows on this section, and include underground bywash culverts, capable of carrying the full <b>flood</b> <b>flow</b> of all three streams. A new weir which carries a towpath bridge has been constructed where the water leaves the canal to enter the River Frome, and a set of floodgates has been constructed beyond the weir, to protect the canal from high water levels.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} application and national geospatial database {{have been developed}} to support the calculation of <b>flooding</b> <b>flow</b> (Qf) and threshold runoff across the conterminous United States and Alaska. <b>Flooding</b> <b>flow</b> is the flow required to cause a stream to slightly overflow its bank and cause damage. Threshold runoff [L], defined as the depth of runoff required to cause flooding, is computed as <b>flooding</b> <b>flow</b> divided by the unit hydrograph peak flow. A key assumption in this work is that the two-year return flood (Q 2) is a useful surrogate for <b>flooding</b> <b>flow.</b> The application described here computes flood magnitude estimates for selected return periods (Q 2, Q 5, Q 10, etc.) using regression equations published by the U. S. Geological Survey for each of 210 hydrologic regions. The application delineates basin boundaries and computes all basin parameters required for the flood frequency calculations. The geographic information system database that supports these calculations contains terrain data [digital elevation models (DEMs) and DEM derivatives], reference data, and 89 additional data layers related to climate, soils, geology, and land use. Initial results indicate that there are some practical limitations associated with using Q 2 regression equations to estimate <b>flooding</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R

The Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) hydraulic model is applied to simulate <b>flood</b> <b>flows</b> and inundation levels in the downstream floodplain, and also proves to predict water levels accurately.
