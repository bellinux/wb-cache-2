5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{disaster}} King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in a diary of a princess of the first reign, after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. This prophecy was again present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> people, when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antiglobalization {{movement}} and the anti-American left, and perhaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> Islamic terrorists themselves, {{the growth of the}} American Empire has caused the growth of Islamic terrorism. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American political and economic elite, and certainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officials of the Bush administration, the growth of Islamic terrorism has become the cause of the growth of the American Empire. As it happens, both causal theories are probably correct...|$|R

5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{objections to}} the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> scientists, notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack, that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory {{did not include a}} way for this to be possible. Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.|$|E

25|$|Peter's {{imperial}} {{title was}} recognized by Augustus II of Poland, Frederick William I of Prussia, and Frederick I of Sweden, but not by the other European monarchs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> the word emperor connoted superiority or pre-eminence over kings. Several rulers feared that Peter would claim authority over them, just as the Holy Roman Emperor had claimed suzerainty over all Christian nations.|$|E
25|$|The easy {{victory of}} the Māori over the numerically {{stronger}} British-led force gave a powerful impetus to the Pai Mārire movement and confirmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Māori {{the protection of the}} Archangel Gabriel, of whom Te Ua was now regarded as a prophet. The number of adherents swelled and Pai Mārire rites continued to develop, some incorporating the severed heads of the slain soldiers, through which Te Ua claimed to communicate with Jehovah.|$|E
25|$|The {{deaths of}} Custer and his troops became the best-known {{episode in the}} history of the American Indian Wars, due in part to a {{painting}} commissioned by the brewery Anheuser-Busch as part of an advertising campaign. The enterprising company ordered reprints of a dramatic work that depicted “Custer's Last Stand” and had them framed and hung in many United States saloons. This created lasting impressions of the battle and the brewery’s products <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> bar patrons. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote an adoring (and in some places, erroneous) poem. President Theodore Roosevelt's lavish praise pleased Custer's widow.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, St. Louis Cardinals {{first baseman}} Mark McGwire and Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa {{engaged in a}} home run race for the ages. With both rapidly {{approaching}} Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced {{to be the first}} to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent steroid allegations have marred the season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> fans.|$|E
25|$|When {{printed books}} on the occult, {{particularly}} in the English language, had begun to be produced, some cunning folk obtained, and used, grimoires, or books of magic. In many cases they made a big show {{of the fact that}} they owned such tomes, which would have appeared impressive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> of their customers in a period where only a minority of people were able to read and write in Britain. Indeed, some cunning folk appeared to own these grimoires purely for cosmetic reasons, to impress their clients, and did not actually make use of any of the magical rituals contained within them.|$|E
25|$|In 1787, 1789 and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of the French revolution looming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> members of Parliament, few were swayed by Charles James Fox's arguments for equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley specifically. In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of William Pitt and Edmund Burke that most angered Priestley and his friends; they had expected the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

40|$|According to Eugene Nida’s {{theory of}} Dynamic Equivalence, the most {{important}} aim for translators should be to achieve equivalence in effect between original and translated text. Equivalent effect is achieved when a translated text creates the same associations and feelings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> its readers as was produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readers of the original text. Venuti argues that equivalent effect can only be achieved using what {{he refers to as}} ethnocentric domesticating strategies – placing <b>the</b> text <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the target audience. He claims that a foreignizing strategy – placing <b>the</b> reader <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the original text – is more appropriate. Consequently, equivalent effect is, in his view, a poor guiding principle for translation. In this thesis, I challenge Venuti’s view that only domesticating strategies can achieve equivalent effect in translation. Using a response-oriented method, I measure the associations to African American Vernacular English (AAVE) produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> respondents from <b>the</b> source audience. Then, I compare these associations with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> readers of two translations of AAVE – one using a domesticating strategy to translate AAVE, and one using a moderate foreignizing strategy. In contrast to Venuti’s assertions, I find that the moderate foreignizing strategy produces associations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target readers that are more <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source readers than the domesticating strategy...|$|R
25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first meat grinder {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including hot dogs and meatloaf.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Stone Store {{suffered}} the cumulative effects of adjacent traffic movements and {{the ravages of}} normal wear and tear. Costly remedial work was required and {{in the 21st century}} a bypass was constructed and opened on 23 June 2008, to divert traffic and protect the building for posterity. The old stone store bridge was completely removed {{in the second half of}} 2008. The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and the debate over whether this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Fiesta Bowl, {{unhindered}} by conference tie-ins {{and played}} in generally warm weather, propelled itself to major-bowl status by attracting national championship contenders, most notably with its January 1987 matchup between two independent teams Penn State and Miami. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> fans, the Fiesta replaced the Cotton {{as a major}} bowl. Despite this, the Cotton Bowl Classic still retained enough prestige that it was included {{as one of the}} top bowls in the Bowl Coalition when it was formed in 1992. However, in 1995, the new Bowl Alliance (the predecessor of the BCS) chose to include the Fiesta over the Cotton in its rotation. While it was still a major bowl capable of landing Top 10 teams, it was no longer in a position to host a National Championship contestant. In 18 of the 21 seasons since 1995, the Cotton Bowl has featured two ranked opponents. In the other three seasons, one of the teams was ranked (2002, 2003, and 2010).|$|E

25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages {{of the war was}} strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also do care about human suffering.|$|E
