5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> disk onto separate media, its {{time will be}} set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E

25|$|The band's fourth album Ultraphobic was {{released}} in March 1995 and, although critically acclaimed, was not as successful as its predecessors.

The album featured the singles Family Picnic, Followed and the ballad Stronger Now and the band went on tour again, touring America, Japan and Europe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, King {{published}} {{a handful of}} short novels—Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident.

25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost {{is that a}} {{flash memory}} (e.g. a USB flash drive or an SSD) have a much faster seek time than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 {{enables the use of}} up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and Firewire (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.|$|E
25|$|There are varying rules {{within these}} categories, {{for example the}} amount possessed, the role played in the {{transaction}} and {{the intent of the}} goods. Regarding coffee shops, the line between law and practice thins. A coffee shop is a heavily controlled business establishment where individuals can purchase a personal dose of soft drugs in the form of joints, pastry, drinks and packages. In theory illegal, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, Hard drugs, Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams per transaction. Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> drugs scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} later, Andross {{launches}} an attack across the Lylat system. Defending Corneria, Pepper summons the Star Fox team, now consisting of Fox, Peppy, Falco Lombardi and Slippy Toad. While traveling through several planets, the team battles {{with several of}} Andross' henchmen, including the rival mercenaries, Star Wolf. The game’s ending differs depending on which path the player took, if Venom is approached from the Easy Route, Fox defeats Andross, unaware that it is actually a robotic version of himself and destroys it, leaving Andross drifting in the Lylat System. If Venom is approached <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hard</b> Route, Fox battles Andross, in the process revealing Andross' true form {{as that of a}} floating brain, Fox defeats Andross, who attempts to finish Fox off before he is destroyed. James appears and leads Fox out from Venom. After James' disappearance, Star Fox returns to Corneria for a victory celebration. General Pepper offers Fox to be the member Cornerian Army, but he declines it on his behalf for the team. The game ends with the Great Fox and the Star Fox team flying off in their Arwings into the skies.|$|E
25|$|Alec Bedser {{dominated}} the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) {{as much as}} Len Hutton did the batting {{and by the end}} of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.|$|E
