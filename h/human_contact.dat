40|$|The {{antibiotic}} resistance patterns of coliforms in faecal specimens from pigs and their <b>human</b> <b>contacts</b> were studied. The {{ability of the}} resistant coliforms to transfer their resistance in vitro to antibiotic-sensitive recipients was examined. The results showed that pigs which had received antibiotics carried more multiply-resistant, R-factor bearing coliforms than pigs which had not been given antibiotics. <b>Human</b> <b>contacts</b> of the antibiotic-treated pigs had {{a higher incidence of}} antibiotic-resistant coliforms with R-factors than <b>human</b> <b>contacts</b> of pigs which had not been given antibiotics.

5|$|According to a trade data study, painted turtles {{were the}} second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit <b>human</b> <b>contact</b> to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid <b>human</b> <b>contact,</b> encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a random {{matching}} model is elaborated to characterize bilateral interregional <b>human</b> face-to-face <b>contacts.</b> The bilateral contacts {{can be realized}} only when both parties agree to meet each other. Thus, mutual agreement {{is the core of}} our contact modeling. Spatial distribution of bilateral contacts can be described as the results of random matching by potential meeting partners. The failure in agreement of meeting is the major source of inefficiency in <b>human</b> <b>contacts</b> among regions. The paper provides a random matching scheme to describe the generation mechanism of inter-regional <b>human</b> <b>contacts.</b> The paper concludes by illustrating some numerical examples showing how changes in transportation costs can modify the inter-regional interactability in terms of the face-to-face contacts. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the {{possible}} role of pigs as intermediate host for Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus through detection of antibodies to RVF in the sera of pigs and <b>human</b> <b>contacts.</b> Two hundreds and forty five of pig blood samples and forty three blood samples of <b>human</b> <b>contacts</b> to the pigs (Veterinarian and their assistants, butchers and Abattoir workers) were collected from pigs' abattoir at Alexandria governorate, Egypt. Blood samples were subjected to the detection of RVF antibodies by both ELISA and HAI techniques. The detection rate of RVF antibodies in pig sera by ELISA was 37 positive (15. 1 %) out of 245 tested sera samples. The highest detection rate of positive samples was in winter season (12 out of 58, (20. 69 %) and the lowest detection rate was at summer season (7 out of 70, (10. 0 %), while it was 9 (15. 79 %) and 9 (15. 0 %) positive out of 57 and 60 tested sera samples in spring and autumn seasons respectively with {{no significant differences between}} them. When HAI technique was applied to detect the RVF antibodies in pig sera, it gave only 20 positive samples out of 245 (8. 16 %) with highest detection rate was also in winter 7 (12. 07 %) while it was only 1 (1. 43 %) in summer season with significant differences between the results obtained in the summer season and those of autumn and winter seasons. History was taken from all of <b>human</b> <b>contacts</b> to exclude the possibilities of taking neither vaccination nor infection from other sources.

5|$|In 1914, aliens {{known as}} Mondoshawans {{arrive at an}} ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for {{safekeeping}} concerning World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their <b>human</b> <b>contact,</b> a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E
5|$|These {{monitors}} {{will rise}} {{up on their}} hind legs to check their surroundings, a behavior that has also been documented in Gould's monitors (V.gouldii). They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they will give a warning call if they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids <b>human</b> <b>contact,</b> but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved <b>human</b> <b>contact,</b> {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and feed him. In a few instances those captured were first forced to help the Germans with the looting of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E

5|$|Bordering to {{the north}} of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon Island State Park, {{accessible}} only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge {{at the bottom of the}} river. River otters (Lutra canadensis) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of <b>human</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E
5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} {{spotted eagle ray}} an {{aquarium}} attraction, although because of its large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the spotted eagle ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of spotted eagle rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, spotted eagle rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid <b>human</b> <b>contact.</b> Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three spotted eagle rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the spotted eagle ray.|$|E

The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys <b>human</b> <b>contact,</b> and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E

5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, <b>human</b> <b>contact</b> is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E
5|$|These {{sedentary}} peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing {{logging and}} harvesting of other resources {{on a large}} scale. The construction of irrigation canals {{may have led to}} a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to <b>human</b> <b>contact,</b> rivers such as the Gila, Salt and Chaco were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large floodplains. In time, flash floods caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into arroyos, making agriculture difficult. A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14thcentury A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado River basin abruptly collapsed. Some Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico and south-central Colorado, becoming the predecessors of the Hopi, Zuni, Laguna and Acoma people in western New Mexico. Many of the tribes that inhabited the Colorado River basin at the time of European contact were descended from Puebloan and Hohokam survivors, while others already had a long history of living in the region or migrated in from bordering lands.|$|E
