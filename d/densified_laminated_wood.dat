40|$|Summary This research, {{based on}} the theory of market structure, is {{intended}} to discuss the market structure in Taiwan wood flooring industry. To decide the market structure, the market concentration ratio method was introduced. Also, the factors of the entry barriers that will affect the market structure on wood flooring industry was examined. As a result, {{there are two types}} of wood floorings, solid and <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> flooring in Taiwan market. The sales volume of solid wood flooring are 2 million 637 thousand square meters and laminated are 1 million 815 thousand square meters in 1997. The solid wood flooring is mainly used in the residential area, and the <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> flooring is mainly used in the public area. The characteristics of wood flooring considered by consumer are stability, shallow color and no defective. The solid wood flooring, two and three level of distribution channel are normally used. The <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> flooring, three level of distribution channel are normally used. As for the market structure analysis, the <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> flooring is identified as an oligopoly market. The market structure of solid wood flooring is a competitive market. 摘 要 本研究主要目的在於以市場的背景現況及市場結構理論，來探 討臺灣木質地板的市場結構形態。研究中透過實地調查瞭解市場的 現況，並以市場集中度衡量臺灣木質地板市場結構，同時以市場進 入障礙來檢視國內木質地板市場結構之變化。經由調查得知，臺灣 木質地板市場主要分為實木地板與銘木地板兩類。目前木質地板 1997 年的銷售量，實木地板約為 81 萬坪，銘木地板約為 55 萬坪。以使 用場所而言，實木地板多用於一般家庭，而銘木地板多用於公共場 所。而在材種選擇的偏好上，消費者主要以材質穩定性、材面色淺 均勻無缺點為選擇重點。在配銷通路上，實木地板為二階與三階的 通路，而銘木地板為三階的通路。另外以市場結構分析臺灣木銘木 地板市場為大型製造商所形成之寡占市場，具高規模經濟性，因此 有高的進入障礙，而獲利性高，不過風險比較大；實木地板市場為 小型經銷商組成之競爭性市場，市場進入障礙低，產品差異性亦低， 因此獲利性也較低，但風險則相對較穩定...|$|R

Modeling the structure of many done in making samples for the very complex structure, both in geometry and structure of the boundary conditions. Modelling composite wood beam specimen duren-sengon is to make <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> beam specimen (glulam beam) using a scale model, because all this research on <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> beams (glulam beam) always use the test object prototype. In this paper we will discuss about how to calculate scale model of <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> beams so that the behavior of the model scale specimens will be made in accordance with the behavior of a prototype test object. The steps of the test object modeling of composite <b>laminated</b> <b>wood</b> beams duren-sengon is to create model structures using the True Model. Because of the True Model similarity met all the requirements or have complete similarity. There are 10 (ten) types of physical variables involved in the modeling calculations include loads (F), span (l), deflection (δ), moment of inertia (I), stiffness (K), modulus of elasticity (E), stress (σ), bending moment (M), beam width (b) and high beam (h).
