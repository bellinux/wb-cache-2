5|$|A {{bartender}} {{is working}} at a saloon, serving drinks to customers. After he fills a stereotypically Irish man's bucket with beer, Carrie Nation and her followers burst inside. They assault the Irish man, pulling his hat over his eyes and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's <b>face</b> <b>before</b> a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Juggernaut {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire from professional wrestling after nearly 1500 matches. Although he was healthy, he decided to retire before he suffered any injuries that would hurt him in his future life outside the ring. On his website, he posted {{a list of the}} ten wrestlers he wished to <b>face</b> <b>before</b> retiring. The list includes such wrestlers as Samoa Joe, Aaron Idol, Bryan Danielson, and Steve Corino.|$|E
5|$|The mosque's main {{ablution}} fountain, {{known as}} al-Kas ("the Cup"), is located {{north of the}} mosque {{between it and the}} Dome of the Rock. It is used by worshipers to perform wudu, a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and <b>face</b> <b>before</b> entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads, but in 1327–28 Governor Tankiz enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied with water from Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem, it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply. In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.|$|E

5|$|Thrice re-entered {{the studio}} with {{producer}} Brian McTernan to record its Hopeless/Sub City debut, The Illusion of Safety. The album was released in February 2002 and the band toured extensively to support it, opening for Further Seems Forever and Face to <b>Face</b> <b>before</b> embarking on its first headlining tour later that year. The band again donated {{a portion of the}} album's proceeds, this time choosing a non-profit youth shelter in South Central Los Angeles, A Place Called Home. The band's donations were matched by their label.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to <b>face</b> <b>before</b> a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must <b>face</b> <b>before</b> the Elite Four.|$|E

5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's <b>face</b> <b>before</b> kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the <b>face</b> <b>before</b> two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E
25|$|On the {{political}} front, {{the campaign was}} a great boost for the Communists in their negotiations at the peace talks in Chongqing. The Kuomintang suffered {{from the loss of}} territory, troops, and materiel. The Nationalist also lost <b>face</b> <b>before</b> the Chinese public, which expected the Kuomintang to produce results in the peace talks.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{took place}} in North London and Piper was treated in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where the {{surgeons}} removed all the skin from her <b>face</b> <b>before</b> rebuilding it with a skin substitute and then a skin graft. The procedure {{was the first of}} its kind to be completed in a single operation. Katie also underwent Ex-vivo limbal stem cell allograft transplantation (EVSCALT) at the Centre for Sight to restore her vision.|$|E
25|$|Some {{political}} analysts, {{particularly in}} Taiwanese newspapers, {{have speculated that}} the moderate approach that the Central Government has presented toward Hong Kong bears the imprint of more reformist thinking in the new fourth generation of leadership led by paramount leader Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao. It has also been suggested that {{a major influence on}} Beijing's reaction to the demonstrations is the strong desire to put on a good <b>face</b> <b>before</b> the Presidential election in Taiwan in March 2004 and generally make Taiwanese public opinion more amenable to the cause of Chinese reunification.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Lt. Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama after killing off his {{remaining}} henchman. However, Lt. Wahyu ends up betraying Dagu by shooting {{him to the}} <b>face</b> <b>before</b> taking Tama hostage, intending to use him as a shield to escape. When the duo encounter Rama and Andi as they're going down stairs, Tama taunts Wahyu revealing that {{he had already been}} waiting for them before the raid began and Lt. Wahyu was set-up by his corrupt higher-ups; indicating that he will be killed regardless of escaping. In despair, Lt. Wahyu kills Tama and attempts suicide, only to find he has no ammunition left.|$|E

25|$|About 1:30 PM on 8 August 1809, the 600 dragoons of General of Brigade Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's brigade {{burst out}} of cover, trotted {{down to the river}} bank, and splashed into the river. They rapidly navigated the deep part of the ford and soon reached the {{shallows}} on the south bank. The 1st Extremadura Hussar Regiment and an infantry battalion from the bridge defenders tried to oppose the French cavalry. Caulaincourt's troopers set upon the Spanish hussars and soon routed them. The victorious French horsemen regrouped and charged the infantry. With its adversaries galloping toward it, the battalion tried to form square, but was unable to close the rear <b>face</b> <b>before</b> the dragoons charged through the gap. As the square broke up, many Spanish foot soldiers were hewn down or surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The party {{started from}} Zermatt on 13 July at half-past five. The eight members {{included}} Peter Taugwalder {{and his two}} sons, Peter and Joseph, who were acting as porters. At 8.20 they reached the chapel at Schwarzsee, where they picked up some material that was left there. They continued along the ridge and at half past eleven they reached {{the base of the}} peak. Then they left the ridge and proceeded for half an hour on the east <b>face.</b> <b>Before</b> twelve o'clock they had found a good position for the tent, and at a height of 3,380 metres they set the bivouac. Meanwhile, Croz and young Peter Taugwalder went on to explore the route, in order to save time on the following day. They turned back before 3 p.m., reporting that that ridge offered no great difficulties.|$|E
25|$|A Redondo Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was {{assigned}} to investigate Dalton's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes which he had confided to Dalton had occurred between June and October. Bynum initially noted that Dalton's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been reported missing over the previous five months. In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Dalton where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed mace {{in the face of}} a woman, who had then been dragged into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident which occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed in her <b>face</b> <b>before</b> being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released. Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed with a happy <b>face</b> <b>before</b> being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the happy face bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' instead of what they have substantially cognized.|$|E
25|$|The {{submarine}} {{had settled}} {{on the bottom of}} the fjord until darkness and surfaced at 21:15 to put the commandos ashore by dinghy. Safely reaching the shore they hid their dinghy under some stones and moss. They then set out across the mountains to Glomfjord. Reaching the Black Glacier undetected, Captain Houghton and one of the Norwegians, Granlund, went ahead to carry out a reconnaissance of the area. When the reconnaissance party returned they started to climb the mountain. This became an increasingly difficult climb: at one stage they had to traverse a near vertical rock <b>face</b> <b>before</b> reaching the summit. The commandos were unaware that their presence was already suspected. A German topographical party was in the area, and its commander, Leutnant Wilhelm Dehne, had spotted some unidentified figures above the Glomfjord. Later he discovered some Player's cigarette packets and the remains of a camp. Fortunately for the commandos, his route back to Glomfjord took him away from where they were waiting, in a hideout overlooking the power plant.|$|E
25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams went right into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her coccyx when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the <b>face</b> <b>before</b> a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
