Enhancing important provisioning <b>ecosystem</b> services, such as food and timber, often leads to tradeoffs between regulating and cultural <b>ecosystem</b> services, such as nutrient cycling, flood protection, and tourism. We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of <b>ecosystem</b> service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. <b>Ecosystem</b> service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 <b>ecosystem</b> services in a mixed-use landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada.

Several important areas considered include land cover, biodiversity, and carbon, water and soil related <b>ecosystem</b> services. We found that remote sensing can be used for <b>ecosystem</b> service assessment in three different ways: direct monitoring, indirect monitoring, and combined use with <b>ecosystem</b> models. Some plant and water related <b>ecosystem</b> services can be directly monitored by remote sensing. Most commonly, remote sensing can provide surrogate information on plant and soil characteristics in an <b>ecosystem.</b> For <b>ecosystem</b> process related <b>ecosystem</b> services, remote sensing can help measure spatially explicit parameters.

5|$|Some researchers, {{as well as}} some timber {{companies}} and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many <b>ecosystems.</b> Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to <b>ecosystems,</b> and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to <b>ecosystems.</b> In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of <b>ecosystems.</b> By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property.
