50|$|Fee simple estates may {{be either}} fee simple {{absolute}} or defeasible (i.e. subject to future conditions) like <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and <b>fee</b> simple subject to condition subsequent; this is the complex system of future interests (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into actuarial science {{through the use of}} life contingencies.|$|R
5000|$|A {{defeasible estate}} is created when a grantor {{transfers}} land conditionally. Upon the happening {{of the event}} or condition stated by the grantor, the transfer may be void or at least subject to annulment. (An estate not subject to such conditions is called an indefeasible estate.) Historically, the common law has frowned {{on the use of}} defeasible estates as it interferes with the owners' enjoyment of their property and as such has made it difficult to create a valid future interest. Unless a defeasible estate is clearly intended, modern courts will construe the language against this type of estate. Three types of defeasible estates are the <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable,</b> <b>fee</b> simple subject to an executory limitation or interest, and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.|$|R
5000|$|When {{presented}} {{with oil and}} gas cases, early common law jurists were somewhat reluctant to recognize a corporeal possessory interest in substances they considered to be fugacious or “wild and migratory,” and therefore subject to loss by drainage. Among U.S. states, two different theories of ownership {{of oil and gas}} arose. Some states, such as Texas, have adopted the “ownership-in-place” theory for oil and gas that a landowner owns a corporeal possessory interest (similar to a fee simple) in the substances beneath his land, but his ownership is a <b>determinable</b> <b>fee</b> subject to the rule of capture. [...] Other states, like Oklahoma, have adopted the “exclusive-right-to-take” theory that a landowner does not own the substances that underlie his land, but merely retains the exclusive right to capture the substances, a non-corporeal interest. The difference between the two theories is primarily of import in determining remedies.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> is {{an estate}} that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will {{revert to the}} grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility of reverter follows a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable.</b> However a possibility of reverter does not follow a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and a possibility of reverter.|$|R
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a {{fee simple}} estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other {{fee simple estate}}s in real property include fee simple defeasible (or <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable)</b> estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and the <b>fee</b> simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable.</b> If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. <b>Fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> {{does not}} violate the rule against perpetuities, since the {{interest}} in real property reverts to the grantor or his heirs, who are measuring lives.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{possibility}} of reverter when an estate {{will return to the}} grantor if a condition is violated. The possibility of reverter can only follow a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable.</b>|$|R
50|$|This type {{of future}} {{interest}} can only follow the <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable.</b> The vesting {{of the future}} interest is determinable {{at the time of}} the grant, because reverter is automatic if the condition is broken—a possibility of reverter, therefore, is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities.|$|R
50|$|Some jurisdictions in the United States have {{abolished}} this interest. For example, Kentucky {{abolished the}} <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and {{possibility of reverter}} by statute in 1960. An attempt to create such an interest is construed as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (see below), and a person who would have possibility of reverter at common law will instead have a right of entry.|$|R
50|$|Reversion {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the possibility of reverter created in the grant of a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable.</b> Although both result in the return of the land to the original grantor or his heirs, reversions occur upon the natural expiration of the grantee's estate, while the possibility of reverter actively ends the grantee's otherwise-indefinite estate as a consequence of the grantee's failure to comply with the condition contained in the grant.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} the general inappropriateness of strictly adhering to any one predetermined standard in compensating owners whose property has been taken. Holmes' admonition is appropriate in this instance not because the reasons behind the standards have vanished, but because the courts, "from blind imitation" of these objective standards, have strayed from their reason for being. That reason is the just compensation requirement in the fifth amendment. Section II of this article compares United States Supreme Court opinions with other approaches to determine when, in general, compensation is "just" compensation. The {{purpose of this}} section is to urge that just compensation be equated with the fifth amendment's dictate of fairness and indemnity rather than with any one objective standard. Section III analyzes the rules the Restatement of Property and the courts have provided for deciding how a future interest holder should be compensated. The rules governing compensation for an owner of a possibility of reverter are emphasized throughout, since they represent the most egregious departure from the constitutional dictate. This section presents the condemnation of <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinables</b> as representative of the objective standards' failure in determining just compensation in all takings cases and proposes restructuring this approach by dethroning objective standards and emphasizing the equities of each case. Section IV reviews a recent article by Professors Goldberg and Merrill, and Daniel Unumb in which they support a "default rule" which gives the entire condemnation award to the grantee of a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> thereby denying the owner of the possibility of reverter any compensation. Section IV takes issue with their support of this rule and demonstrates that, despite their indications to the contrary, ex ante clauses could work effectively in a deed granting a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rule {{does not}} apply to {{interests}} in the grantor himself. For example, the grant [...] "For A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises, then to B" [...] would violate the rule as to B. However, the conveyance to B would be stricken, leaving [...] "To A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises." [...] This would create a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> in A, with a possibility of reverter in the grantor (or the grantor's heirs). The grant to B would be void as it is possible alcohol would be sold on the premises more than 21 years after the deaths of A, B, and the grantor. However, as the rule {{does not apply}} to grantors, the possibility of reverter in the grantor (or his heirs) would be valid.|$|R
40|$|A 1929 deed which {{conveyed}} {{land from}} private individuals {{to a city}} provided: “... In the event said lands... shall not be kept and maintained as a park... {{for use by the}} white race only..., the lands hereby conveyed shall revert in fee simple... ” In 1955 a declaratory judgment was sought to determine the validity of the restriction and reverter clauses. Held: the operation of such language created a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> with a possibility of reverter. Since such reversion would be automatic and would not require any judicial enforcement by state courts, Negroes who desired to use the park facilities would not be deprived of equal protection of the laws by state action. The instant case is of interest {{not only because of the}} court’s holding; but also, because of the presence of two other problems which the court does not discuss. First, is the maintenance of the park by the city an action of the state which is within the proscription of the Fourteenth Amendment? Second, is the restriction illegal...|$|R
5000|$|The rule never {{applies to}} {{conditions}} {{placed on a}} conveyance to a charity that, if violated, would convey the property to another charity. For example, a conveyance [...] "to the Red Cross, {{so long as it}} operates an office on the property, but if it does not, then to the World Wildlife Fund" [...] would be valid under the rule, because both parties are charities. Even though the interest of the Fund might not vest for hundreds of years, the conveyance would nonetheless be held valid. The exception, however, does not apply if the conveyance, upon violation of the condition, is not from one charity to another charity. Thus, a devise [...] "to John Smith, so long as no one operates a liquor store on the premises, but if someone does operate a liquor store on the premises, then to the Roman Catholic Church" [...] would violate the rule. The exception would not apply to the transfer from John Smith to the Roman Catholic Church because John Smith is not a charity. Also, if the original conveyance was [...] "to John Smith and his heirs for as long as John Smith does not use the premises to sell liquor, but if he does, then to the Red Cross" [...] this would violate the rule because it could be more than 21 years before the interest in Red Cross would vest, and therefore, their interest is void. Thus leaving John with a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and the grantor a possibility of reverter.|$|R
