5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and <b>esterification,</b> amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an <b>esterification</b> reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by <b>esterification</b> of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E

40|$|Lipase-catalyzed <b>esterifications</b> in biphasic media (heptane–water, 1 : 1) were {{conducted}} by using Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) as biocatalyst. Different carboxylic acids (from acetic to lauric) were thus esterified with 1 -butanol at different pH values (2 – 10). For all carboxylic acids tested, pH optima for the enzymatic <b>esterifications</b> were ca. 3 – 5, in clear agreement with previous literature, and quite different from optima pH of TLL in hydrolytic reactions (8 – 11). Interestingly, the interval of pH in which TLL was active in <b>esterifications,</b> varied markedly depending on the carboxylic acid. Thus, for long-chain acids (i. e. lauric), such pH interval was much wider than for short-chain carboxylic acids (i. e. acetic). To understand this effect, simple pKa values of carboxylic acids, retrieved from open literature, are not sufficient, since those values are measured in pure water. When a second phase is added, aspects related to partition coefficient of each carboxylic acid {{need to be considered}} as well, thus leading to the apparent pKa concept. Herein we performed theoretical calculations to obtain such app pKa of each carboxylic acid. When such calculations were compared with the pH interval, a clear correlation was observed. Overall, results confirm that lipases accept only the protonated form of the carboxylic acid (R–COOH) during <b>esterifications</b> in biphasic media...|$|R

5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the <b>esterification</b> of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E

40|$|Enzymes {{are natural}} {{catalysts}} accelerating chemical reactions in biological systems. Used {{in technical processes}} they enable the targeted production of various substances. Separated form their natural environment enzymes are able to keep their catalytic activity in different solvents and reaction conditions. The high catalytic activity of lipase (Candida cylindracea) in e. g. n-hexane or toluene is known for more than 15 years. Chances for new production routes are also given by enzymatic catalysed reactions in systems without foreign solvents. <b>Esterifications</b> e. g. can be conducted using excess alcohol as subtrate and as solvent.

25|$|The non-esterified {{galacturonic acid}} units {{can be either}} free acids (carboxyl groups) or salts with sodium, potassium, or calcium. The salts of {{partially}} esterified pectins are called pectinates, if the degree of <b>esterification</b> is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates, the insoluble acid form, pectic acid.|$|E
25|$|High-ester pectins set {{at higher}} {{temperatures}} than low-ester pectins. However, gelling reactions with calcium increase as {{the degree of}} <b>esterification</b> falls. Similarly, lower pH-values or higher soluble solids (normally sugars) increase gelling speed. Suitable pectins can therefore be selected for jams and for jellies, or for higher sugar confectionery jellies.|$|E

25|$|The natural <b>esterification</b> {{that takes}} place in wines and other {{alcoholic}} beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed <b>esterification.</b> Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of a percentage point by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.|$|E

25|$|Pyridine {{is used as}} a polar, basic, low-reactive solvent, {{for example}} in Knoevenagel condensations. It is {{especially}} suitable for the dehalogenation, where it acts as the base of the elimination reaction and bonds the resulting hydrogen halide to form a pyridinium salt. In <b>esterifications</b> and acylations, pyridine activates the carboxylic acid halides or anhydrides. Even more active in these reactions are the pyridine derivatives 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine. Pyridine is also used as a base in condensation reactions.|$|R
25|$|Salicylic acid has {{the formula}} C6H4(OH)COOH, where the OH group is ortho to the {{carboxyl}} group. It {{is also known}} as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is poorly soluble in water (2 g/L at 20°C). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) can be prepared by the <b>esterification</b> of the phenolic hydroxyl group of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. Salicylic acid can also be prepared using the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.|$|E
25|$|Ethyl acetate {{is formed}} in wine by the <b>esterification</b> of ethanol and acetic acid.

High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{reacting}} {{sulfuric acid}} with potassium nitrate {{can be used}} to produce nitric acid and a precipitate of potassium bisulfate. When combined with nitric acid, sulfuric acid acts both as an acid and a dehydrating agent, forming the nitronium ion , which is important in nitration reactions involving electrophilic aromatic substitution. This type of reaction, where protonation occurs on an oxygen atom, is important in many organic chemistry reactions, such as Fischer <b>esterification</b> and dehydration of alcohols.|$|E

50|$|Although {{not widely}} {{employed}} for <b>esterifications,</b> salts of carboxylate anions can be alkylating agent with alkyl halides to give esters. In {{the case that}} an alkyl chloride is used, an iodide salt can catalyze the reaction (Finkelstein reaction). The carboxylate salt is often generated in situ. In difficult cases, the silver carboxylate may be used, since the silver ion coordinates to the halide aiding its departure and improving the reaction rate. This reaction can suffer from anion availability problems and, therefore, can benefit from the addition of phase transfer catalysts or highly polar aprotic solvents such as DMF.|$|R
25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol). From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the <b>esterification,</b> and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).|$|E
25|$|Three major ideas governed {{modifications}} of testosterone into {{a multitude of}} AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created orally active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; <b>esterification</b> of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may {{be present in the}} body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both oral and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios.|$|E
