They'd startle an English pit {{where there was}} <b>fire-damp.</b> Do you know it's a solemn fact that if you drop a Davy lamp or snatch it quickly you can blow a whole English pit inside out with all the miners? Good for us that we don't know what <b>fire-damp</b> is here. We can use flare-lamps." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the boys}} no longer walked side by side. Sam led the way, {{watching}} narrowly the lamp in his companion's cap {{to discover the}} first signs of <b>fire-damp,</b> and guarding well the flame which served to show him the proper course.|$|E
60|$|This fact explains, also, why in mines of wood-coal {{carbonic}} acid, i.e. choke-damp, {{alone is}} given off. For in the wood-coal {{a great deal}} of the hydrogen still remains. In mines of true coal, not only is choke-damp given off, but that more terrible pest of the miners, <b>fire-damp,</b> or explosive carburetted hydrogen and olefiant gases. Now the occurrence of that <b>fire-damp</b> in mines proves that changes are still going on in the coal: that it is getting rid of its hydrogen, and so progressing toward the state of anthracite or culm--stone-coal as it is sometimes called. In the Pennsylvanian coal-fields some of the coal has actually done this, under the disturbing force of earthquakes; for the coal, which is bituminous, like our common coal, to the westward where the strata are horizontal, becomes gradually anthracite as it is tossed and torn by the earthquake faults of the Alleghany and Appalachian mountains.|$|E
60|$|In August, 1815, Davy's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} the loss of life by explosions of <b>fire-damp,</b> {{and by the end of}} the year he had devised his safety-lamp. The coal owners subscribed 1,500 pounds for a testimonial, gave him also a dinner and a service of plate. In October, 1818, he was made a baronet. In November, 1820, he was elected President of the Royal Society.|$|E
60|$|But, further forward, so deadly was the {{broadside}} {{from the}} heavy batteries of the Serapis--levelled point-blank, and {{right down the}} throat and bowels, as it were, of the Richard--that it cleared everything before it. The men on the Richard's covered gun-deck ran above, like miners from the <b>fire-damp.</b> Collecting on the forecastle, they continued to fight with grenades and muskets. The soldiers also were in the lofty tops, whence they kept up incessant volleys, cascading their fire down as pouring lava from cliffs.|$|E
60|$|If it be {{said that}} these {{arguments}} are general, is it not true that special circumstances differentiate the case of coal-miners from that of many other industries in this country? Others have spoken of {{the heat of the}} mine, the danger of <b>fire-damp,</b> of the cramped position, of the muscular exertions of the miner, at work in moist galleries perhaps a mile under the ground. I select the single fact of deprivation of natural light. That alone is enough to justify Parliament in directing upon the industry of coal-mining a specially severe scrutiny and introducing regulations of a different character from those elsewhere.|$|E

But in my opinion, when an Englishman gets as low as he can he's got to dodge so that the dregs of other nations don't drop ballast on him out of their balloons. And if he's a Liverpool Englishman, why, <b>fire-damp</b> is what he's got to look out for. Being a natural American, that's my personal view. But Liverpool and me had much in common. We were without decorous clothes or ways and means of existence; and, as the saying goes, misery certainly does enjoy the society of accomplices.|$|E

And now it has got air; it will burn its whole substance, its whole smoke-atmosphere too, and fill all France with flame. Strange lot! Forty years of that smouldering, with foul <b>fire-damp</b> and vapour enough, then victory over that;--and like a burning mountain he blazes heaven-high; and, for twenty-three resplendent months, pours out, in flame and molten fire-torrents, all that is in him, the Pharos and Wonder-sign of an amazed Europe;--and then lies hollow, cold forever!

60|$|But we {{must speak}} of candles {{as they are}} in commerce. Here are a couple of candles {{commonly}} called dips. They are made of lengths of cotton cut off, hung up by a loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again and cooled, then re-dipped until there is an accumulation of tallow round the cotton. In order that you may have an idea of the various characters of these candles, you see these which I hold in my hand--they are very small, and very curious. They are, or were, the candles used by the miners in coal mines. In olden times the miner had to find his own candles; and it was supposed that a small candle would not so soon set fire to the <b>fire-damp</b> in the coal mines as a large one; and for that reason, as well as for economy's sake, he had candles made of this sort--20, 30, 40, or 60 to the pound. They have been replaced since then by the steel-mill, and then by the Davy-lamp, and other safety-lamps of various kinds. I have here a candle that was taken out of the Royal George[1], it is said, by Colonel Pasley. It has been sunk in the sea for many years, subject to the action of salt water. It shews you how well candles may be preserved; for though it is cracked about and broken a good deal, yet, when lighted, it goes on burning regularly, and the tallow resumes its natural condition as soon as it is fused.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in this}} mental disposition, {{physically}} very empty, {{but still}} nauseated by what he had seen, {{that he had come}} upon the Professor. Under these conditions which make for irascibility in a sound, normal man, this meeting was specially unwelcome to Chief Inspector Heat. He had not been thinking of the Professor; he had not been thinking of any individual anarchist at all. The complexion of that case had somehow forced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things human, which in the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an unphilosophical temperament, and in concrete instances becomes exasperating beyond endurance. At the beginning of his career Chief Inspector Heat had been concerned with the more energetic forms of thieving. He had gained his spurs in that sphere, and naturally enough had kept for it, after his promotion to another department, a feeling not very far removed from affection. Thieving was not a sheer absurdity. It was a form of human industry, perverse indeed, but still an industry exercised in an industrious world; it was work undertaken for the same reason as the work in potteries, in coal mines, in fields, in tool-grinding shops. It was labour, whose practical difference from the other forms of labour consisted in the nature of its risk, which did not lie in ankylosis, or lead poisoning, or <b>fire-damp,</b> or gritty dust, but in what may be briefly defined in its own special phraseology as “Seven years hard.” Chief Inspector Heat was, of course, not insensible to the gravity of moral differences. But neither were the thieves he had been looking after. They submitted to the severe sanctions of a morality familiar to Chief Inspector Heat with a certain resignation.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, however, George was {{not entirely}} {{occupied}} with the consideration of his growing engine. He had the clocks and watches to mend; he had Robert's schooling to look after; and he had another practical matter even nearer home than the locomotive on which to exercise his inventive genius. One day, in 1814, the main gallery of the colliery caught fire. Stephenson at once descended into the burning pit, with a chosen band of volunteers, who displayed the usual heroic courage of colliers in going {{to the rescue of}} their comrades; and, at the risk of their lives, these brave men bricked up the burning portion, and so, by excluding the air, put out the dangerous fire. Still, even so, several of the workmen had been suffocated, and one of the pitmen asked Geordie in dismay whether nothing could be done to prevent such terrible disasters in future. [...] "The price of coal-mining now," [...] he said, [...] "is pitmen's lives." [...] Stephenson promised to think the matter over; and he did think it over with good effect. The result of his thought was the apparatus still affectionately known to the pitmen as [...] "the Geordie lamp." [...] It is a lamp so constructed that the flame cannot pass out into the air outside, and so cause explosions in the dangerous <b>fire-damp</b> which is always liable to occur abundantly in the galleries of coal mines. By this invention alone George Stephenson's name and memory might have been kept green for ever; for his lamp has been the means of saving thousands of lives from a sudden, a terrible, and a pitiful death. Most accidents that now occur in mines are due to the neglect of ordinary precautions, and to the perverse habit of carrying a naked lighted candle in the hand (contrary to regulations) instead of a carefully guarded safety lamp. Yet so culpably reckless of their own and other men's lives are {{a large number of people}} everywhere, that in spite of the most stringent and salutary rules, explosions from this cause (and, therefore, easily avoidable) take place constantly to the present day, though far less frequently than before the invention of the Geordie lamp.|$|E
50|$|After the Unification of Italy {{the area}} {{experienced}} an economic boom, {{largely due to}} extensive mining of sulfur. The mining was accompanied by various misfortunes: on the 27th of April 1867 47 people died due to a <b>fire-damp</b> explosion in the Trabonella mine; 65 miners died on November 12, 1881 in Gessolungo mine because of an explosion; and another 51 died in 1911 in Deliella and Trabonella mines.|$|E
5000|$|In testing {{however it}} {{was found to be}} {{extremely}} sensitive to combined friction and percussion, and could be readily ignited by a glancing blow with wood. Found also to be chemically unstable, it was known to ignite spontaneously both in the laboratory and in a magazine. A report of the French commission on the use of explosives in the presence of <b>fire-damp</b> in mines concluded that [...] "The presence of chlorate of potash makes this substance too dangerous, for its use to be recommended." ...|$|E
50|$|Allan Holmes, Company Director, {{took the}} stand {{following}} Binns. He was asked whether {{he knew about the}} gas. He said that Holmes had told him in either July or August 1878. Hodge had taken quite a casual attitude to it and Holmes had asked him to institute safety lamps. Beardsmore had been tasked with inspecting the mine for fire damp prior to letting the men enter the mine. In January 1879 safety lamps had been ordered. After his evidence the Coroner provided instructions to the jury, before they retired to consider their verdict, on what they needed to determine. After 50 minutes the jury returned with a finding:First, your Worship, the Jury find that Archibald Hodge, through entering the old workings without ordinary precaution and with a naked light, caused an explosion of <b>fire-damp</b> whereby 34 men and boys lost their lives. Second, the Jury find That William Hodge has not used the necessary precautions to prevent an explosion of <b>fire-damp</b> in the mine over which he had the management. As a rider, we add that seeing that there is no law for inspection and supervision in the conduct of mining, we express the necessity of measures being adopted whereby many accidents may in the future be averted.|$|E
5000|$|At the inquest to the {{disaster}} on Wednesday 20 May 1896, the jury returned the verdict: [...] "We are unanimous that the explosion {{was caused by}} gas, and was purely accidental, and that no blame is to be attached to any person." [...] The cause of the explosion was <b>fire-damp</b> coming into contact with a naked light and exploding, thus igniting coal dust, with the coal dust carrying the explosion forward from its initial point. [...] The Colliery Owners followed {{the recommendations of the}} inquest and issued miners with Routledge Newcastle safety lamps.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{potential}} causes for the disaster was a build-up of gases, which eventually met with the naked flame. Due {{to the size of}} the pit, it was seriously lacking ventilation. Therefore when the built up gases hit the naked flame; It ignited the gas causing the explosion in Pit 1. The insufficiency of the ventilation as well as the poor design of the Pit, for example, with not enough air pits(as pictured below), contributed to the increased risk and probability of a gas explosion. The cause of the explosion is known as <b>Fire-damp,</b> as mentioned in the Gethin Colliery Account.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{after the}} {{explosion}} left 33 widows and 120 fatherless children; an enquiry returned a conclusion that Mount Kembla Mine was both gassy and dusty and that the Meurant brothers and William Nelson [...] "came to their death … from carbon monoxide poisoning produced by an explosion of <b>fire-damp</b> ignited by the naked lights in use in the mine, and accelerated {{by a series of}} coal-dust explosions starting at a point in or about the number one main level back headings, and extending in a westerly direction to the small goaf, marked 11 perches on the mine plan." ...|$|E
50|$|William Henry was apprenticed to Thomas Percival {{and later}} worked with John Ferriar & John Huit at the Manchesters Infirmary. He {{began to study}} {{medicine}} at Edinburgh in 1795, taking his medical in 1807, but ill-health interrupted his practice as a physician, and he devoted his time mainly to chemical research, {{especially with regard to}} gases. One of his best-known papers (published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 1803) describes experiments on the quantity of gases absorbed by water at different temperatures and under different pressures. His results are known today as Henry's law. His other papers deal with gas-analysis, <b>fire-damp,</b> illuminating gas, the composition of hydrochloric acid and of ammonia, urinary and other morbid concretions, and the disinfecting powers of heat. His Elements of Experimental Chemistry (1799) enjoyed considerable vogue in its day, going through eleven editions in 30 years. He was {{one of the founders of}} the Mechanics' Institute that was to become the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a slight fall in the roof in Goodall’s gate, on the West side of the mine, 943 yards from the Downcast shaft. [...] A small quantity of <b>fire-damp</b> escaping from the crack in the roof was ignited by a miner’s candle at 7:15am, just as the men were starting work. No gas had previously been found in the New North Road or Goodall’s Gate in the West Level. Two miners and their ponies were killed at the point of impact, and four more were killed as they began to flee. The explosion travelled south, down New North Road against the air flow, as coal dust dislodged by the explosion carried the dull flame beyond its point of origin, and expanded into a roaring flame when it reached the air in the West Level main intake, and then continued to expand through the mine, killing miners and trapping them, as roofs fell. The explosion tore through the stables, killing and burning the horsekeeper, plus 12 of the 14 pit ponies. The two pit ponies who survived were stood in the middle, partly sheltered by the other ponies.|$|E
