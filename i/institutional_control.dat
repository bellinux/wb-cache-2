25|$|The {{events of}} the seventh century, which {{was a period of}} major crisis for the Byzantine Empire, formed a {{catalyst}} for the expansion of the use of images of the holy and caused a dramatic shift in responses to them. Whether the acheiropoieta were a symptom or cause, the late sixth to eighth centuries witnessed the increasing thinning of the boundary between images not made by human hands, and images made by human hands. Images of Christ, the Theotokos and saints increasingly came to be regarded, as relics, contact relics and acheiropoieta already were, as points of access to the divine. By praying before an image of a holy figure, the believer's prayers were magnified by proximity to the holy. This change in practice {{seems to have been a}} major and organic development in Christian worship, which responded to the needs of believers to have access to divine support during the insecurities of the seventh century. It was not a change orchestrated or controlled by the Church. The events which have traditionally been labelled 'Byzantine Iconoclasm' may be seen as the efforts of the organised Church and the imperial authorities to respond to these changes and to try to reassert some <b>institutional</b> <b>control</b> over popular practice.|$|E

After Heine's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected, allegedly for anti-Semitic motives, a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet (1797–1856), his incensed German-American admirers, including Carl Schurz, started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan, at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the <b>institutional</b> <b>control</b> of public art.

2500|$|USC claims 11 {{national}} titles, including 7 {{from the}} wire service [...] AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. Two of USC's championships, 1928 and 1939, {{are based on}} the Dickinson System, a formula devised by a University of Illinois professor that awarded national championships between 1926 and 1940. The Dickinson System is cited in the Official 2010 NCAA FBS Record Book as a legitimate national title selector. [...] USC's claim is consistent with other FBS programs that won the Dickinson title. [...] In 2004, USC recognized the 1939 squad as one of their national championship teams. The 2004 team was forced to vacate the final two games of its season, including the 2005 Orange Bowl due to NCAA sanctions incurred as a result of loss of <b>institutional</b> <b>control,</b> and namely, in connection with Reggie Bush. USC appealed the sanctions, delaying consideration of vacating USC's 2004 championship by the BCS. Ultimately, USC lost the appeals and forfeited the 2004 BCS championship. The AP did not vacate its 2004 championship, hence the Trojans retain a share of the national title.|$|E
2500|$|After {{coming to}} power in 1949, the Communists {{gradually}} nationalized the publishing industry, centralized the book distribution system, and brought writers under <b>institutional</b> <b>control</b> through the Writers Union. A system of strict censorship was implemented, with Mao's [...] "Yan'an Talks" [...] as the guiding force. Periodic literary campaigns targeted figures such as Hu Shi and other figures from the New Culture period, especially Hu Feng, a protege of Lu Xun who, {{along with his wife}} Mei Zhi, did not toe the Party line on literature. Socialist realism became the uniform style, and many Soviet works were translated. The ability to satirize and expose the evils in contemporary society that had made writers useful to the Communist Party of China before its accession to power was no longer welcomed. Party cultural leaders such as Zhou Yang used Mao's call to have literature [...] "serve the people" [...] to mount attacks on [...] "petty bourgeois idealism" [...] " [...] and humanitarianism." [...] This conflict came to a head in the Hundred Flowers Campaign (1956–57). Mao Zedong initially encouraged writers to speak out against problems in the new society. Having learned the lessons of the anti-Hu Feng campaign, they were reluctant, but then a flurry of newspaper articles, films, and literary works drew attention to such problems as bureaucratism and authoritarianism within the ranks of the party. Shocked at the level of discontent, Mao's Anti-Rightist Movement put large numbers of intellectuals through so-called [...] "thought reform" [...] or sent them to labor camps. At the time of the Great Leap Forward (1957–59), the government increased its insistence on the use of socialist realism and combined with it so-called revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the decade}} of the 1920s unfolded, the New Humanists began to seem {{increasingly}} irrelevant, and as the Depression of the 1930s hit, the intellectual climate turned decidedly leftward and other forms of criticism emerged, initially from writers outside the academy, some of which, in the coming decades would be incorporated as aspects of the New Criticism. Meanwhile, although there was continued chafing against the supposed antiquarianism of the philological school in some quarters, Kittredge's prestige and influence continued unabated, and the extensive list of language requirements for a Harvard graduate degree in English literature, including Old and Middle English, Old French, and Gothic, stayed in effect until his retirement in 1936, after which these requirements, viewed as onerous, were dropped. With the coming of the Cold War in the late 1940s, 50s and early 60s disagreements between the historical and [...] "literary appreciation" [...] schools in English literature studies were subsumed by the ascendancy of the New Criticism which favored, like Kittredge, rigorous study of literary text, but sidestepped potential controversies over ideology by ruling out mention of historical context or social questions. In consequence, the concept of philology itself fell into disrepute and never recovered, even after social engagement once again became respectable and the New Criticism gave way to Structuralism, Gender Studies, Post Modernism, and the New Historicism. Thus, the context of Kittredge's prestige and his place in the history of English literature studies became obscured and forgotten, a situation which in recent years some scholars are attempting to rectify. As Jill Terry Rudy writes:In the process of overthrowing Kittredge’s perceived pedantry in order to enshrine New Critical methods of rigorous research and <b>institutional</b> <b>control</b> over graduate training and doctoral degrees (without offering the concomitant grounding in cultural history and linguistic concerns that Kittredge promoted), New Critical literary scholars assured that the term philology itself would be denigrated and then ignored as their newly trained graduate students conquered the vocabulary and intricacies of critical scholarship (Wellek 1953). As suggested previously, the philosophical methods and ideologies that informed the early history of English department organization deserve continued conversation and critique rather than simply being erased or ignored.|$|E

5000|$|A third five-year review {{completed}} in September 2007 determined {{that all of}} the issues from the second five-year review were addressed {{with the exception of the}} finalization of the property restrictive covenants. Restrictive covenants are one of several legal or administrative controls which help to minimize exposure to contaminants and are generally referred to as <b>institutional</b> <b>controls.</b> The third five-year review determined that the remedy is expected to be or is protective of human health and the environment, and in the interim, exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, some further actions need to be taken, including more robust <b>institutional</b> <b>controls</b> to ensure the remedy is not disturbed in the future. A trial shut-down of the groundwater extraction system has been started by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and ground water monitoring will be performed for several more years to verify that groundwater cleanup goals have been achieved.

40|$|The {{actual and}} {{projected}} manifestations of climate change, including sea level rise, stronger rainstorms, more severe storm events, inland storm surges, and associated flooding, pose {{a host of}} adaptation challenges. The effective management of hazardous waste sites under the new environmental conditions occasioned by climate change presents one such adaptation challenge, though this challenge is easily overlooked {{in the rush to}} protect highly visible and obviously vulnerable infrastructure and populations such as coastal communities. Many hazardous waste sites have been remediated, or are proposed to be remediated, relying {{in whole or in part}} on engineering and <b>institutional</b> <b>controls</b> meant to prevent or limit exposure to contaminants. These remedies include caps over contaminated sediment or soil, deed restrictions, barrier walls and others controls, all of which can allow the contaminants to remain onsite indefinitely. However, the traditional design of these engineering and <b>institutional</b> <b>controls</b> affords protection from historical and predicted environmental conditions that may not reflect real-world conditions generated by climate change, either already present or anticipated. This raises both backward-looking considerations for sites already remediated using engineering and/or <b>institutional</b> <b>controls,</b> and forward-looking considerations with respect to the selection of remedies at sites undergoing cleanup. Could climate change-related storms, flooding, or other events compromise engineering and/or <b>institutional</b> <b>controls</b> and cause new releases of and exposure to contaminants? If so, can or should further work be required at these sites to reduce this risk? In remedy selection, how should regulators take into account the effects of climate change when assessing the protectiveness of remedies, especially remedies incorporating engineering and/or <b>institutional</b> <b>controls?</b> This article considers these questions in the context of a particular type of contaminated site-sites with contaminated sediments subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Although climate change may impact a variety of waste sites in different ways, even those without sediment contamination, this article focuses on sediment sites so as to frame a more manageable inquiry susceptible to in-depth treatment. The following section, Part II, identifies the vulnerability of contaminated sediment sites to climate change. The section describes sediment contamination, regulatory approaches to remediating contaminated sediments, and how climate change may impact sediment remedies. Part III evaluates strategies for managing climate risks at closed, previously remediated sediment sites; these strategies include reopening consent decrees. Part IV considers how climate effects may impact the selection of remedies dependent on engineering or <b>institutional</b> <b>controls</b> at contaminated sediment sites. The article concludes that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) should monitor sediment sites for climate-related damage, particularly after extreme weather events, and should require that future remedies be designed to withstand upper-bound, climate change-adjusted frequencies and severities of relevant climate events. Proposed approaches include more aggressive monitoring requirements that clearly require prompt assessment of sites after severe events, and agreements that contain modified reopener language that expressly addresses whether and when climate change related weather events, projected or actual, will trigger a reopener...|$|R
