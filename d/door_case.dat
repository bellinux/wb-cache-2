The Wesleyan chapel was built in 1822 and is the oldest chapel in the Richmond circuit. From 1834, the parish was placed within the Poor Law Union of Richmond. A national school was built in 1841. The blacksmith's shop has been situated at the same site since 1841. In 1843 the parish was described as being almost entirely agricultural. The Bay Horse Inn public house dates {{as far back as}} at least 1857 (it claims a date of 1725), and its stone <b>door</b> <b>case</b> is 17th century or earlier, almost certainly built using material from the castle. In 1859 [...] "good [...] " [...] was being quarried in the village, although a short-lived copper mine had been discontinued; the father of Christopher Cradock was lord of the manor, and the village was described as [...] "exceedingly neat". According to the 1881 and 1891 Censuses, agriculture and mining were the main industries. In the late nineteenth century, Speight noted the great longevity of many of the parishioners, owing to the space and pure air.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} after I {{came home to}} my hutch with him, I began to {{consider}} where I should lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent {{for him in the}} vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last and in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed <b>door</b> <b>case,</b> and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in getting over that it must needs waken me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up {{to the side of the}} hill; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and make a great noise: as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions, as to my safety on his account.|$|E

5000|$|After his {{marriage}} of Henrietta P. Harvey, {{he and his}} wife lived in Speedwell Plantation. The address is 6135 Merriman Rd., Cave Springs, VA. [...] "Speedwell" [...] was built by Colonel Lewis Speedwell Harvey (1785-1842). In 1819, he acquired a 7,000 acre tract in the south part of Roanoke County, Virginia. Harvey built a furnace for iron production near what is now the village of Starkey. As a result of the abundant supply of brown Hematite found in the area, the Harvey Furnace soon gained an excellent reputation for producing iron of very high quality. His house was completed in 1831. Soon after it was named for the English ship, the Speedwell, that according to family tradition brought Harvey's ancestors to America. [...] "Speedwell", is a classic I-form Virginia house made of brick. Harvey's granddaughter, Henrietta Powers Harvey Starkey, contracted Gustave A.

These are set in two vertical ranges with three equal horizontal panes over a single tall vertical panel at the base. The <b>door</b> <b>cases</b> are composed of symmetrically molded architraves with roundel comer block. The panels of the reveals correspond {{to those of the}} doors. The central passage has single-leaf doors of this design to each of its flanking rooms. The front and rear doors look identical, but are in fact double doors. There is a plastered dado between the simple chair rail and baseboard.|$|R

The housing development in Penton Street 1977 (wide Survey of London) {{can be seen as a}} seminal work which won commendations from the Civic Trust and the DoE. The design of the Penton Street flats attempted to link modern functionalism with the 19th century terraced houses of the two adjoining Conservation Areas. Signifiers of home, such as the railings, the <b>door</b> <b>case</b> with its fanlight and stone sills, became a hallmark of John Melvin's work.|$|E
5000|$|It took Ghiberti 21 {{years to}} {{complete}} the doors. These gilded bronze doors consist of twenty-eight panels, with twenty panels depicting the life of Christ from the New Testament. The eight lower panels show the four evangelists and the Church Fathers: Saint Ambrose, Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory and Saint Augustine. The panels are surrounded by a framework of foliage in the <b>door</b> <b>case</b> and gilded busts of prophets and sibyls at the intersections of the panels. Originally installed {{on the east side}} in place of Pisano's doors, they were later moved to the north side. They are described by the art historian Antonio Paolucci as [...] "the most important event in the history of Florentine art {{in the first quarter of}} the 15th century".|$|E
50|$|Some early Georgian {{houses are}} dotted along the street, {{primarily}} identifiable by the stone Gibbsian <b>door</b> <b>case</b> entrances, {{and close to}} the crossroads with Blessington and North Frederick Streets. Much of the street redeveloped during the Victorian era, with a number of significant buildings built, such as the Gothic style stone-built Dominican priory, designed by J. L. Robinson in 1884-87 at the corner of Dominick Street, while across from it is the red brick Italianette former fire station, designed by C. J. McCarthy and completed in 1903. Much of the street consists of vernacular Victorian terraces, with shops opening straight onto footpaths at ground-floor level. During {{the latter part of the}} twentieth century, stretches of the street were again redeveloped by Dublin Corporation for social housing flat complexes near Dominick Street.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by the farces of {{the ancient}} Roman playwright Plautus (251 - 183 BC), {{specifically}} Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of <b>doors,</b> <b>cases</b> of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: [...] "A {{funny thing happened on}} the way to the theater".|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the houses}} in the village {{appear to have been}} built or rebuilt in brick during the 19th and early 20th centuries but a few older {{buildings}} survive. The Bell Inn, now acting as a bed and breakfast, is an ironstone building of three bays, the north bay of which has been rebuilt in brick; the older part dates from the late 17th century. Its northern end was formerly the village smithy, now mainly used for work on agricultural machinery. On {{the opposite side of the}} road a re-roofed cottage with a symmetrical front and a pedimented <b>door</b> <b>case</b> is dated 1724 with initials JBC. A council housing estate was built on the east side of the road, after the Second World War which housed 50 people when completed. East Langton now contains a total of 103 houses.|$|E

5000|$|As {{recommended}} by Giotto, Andrea Pisano {{was awarded the}} commission to design {{the first set of}} doors at the Florence Baptistery in 1329. The south doors were originally installed on the east side facing the Duomo, and were transferred to their present location in 1452. These proto-Renaissance doors consist of 28 quatrefoil panels, with the twenty top panels depicting scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist. The eight lower panels depict the eight virtues of hope, faith, charity, humility, fortitude, temperance, justice and prudence. Pisano took six years to complete them, finishing in 1336. In 1453, Ghiberti and his son Vittorio were commissioned to add a <b>door</b> <b>case</b> to Pisano's existing panels. Ghiberti died in 1455, eight years before the frame was finished leaving a majority of the work to Vitorrio and other members of his workshop. There is a Latin inscription on top of the door: [...] "Andreas Ugolini Nini de Pisis me fecit A.D. MCCCXXX" [...] (Andrea Pisano made me in 1330). The South Doors were undergoing restoration during September, 2016.|$|E
