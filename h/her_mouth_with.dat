25|$|In 1988 Chikatilo {{killed three}} times, murdering an {{unidentified}} woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands {{behind her back}} and stuffed <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> dirt, before severing her nose from her face and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her {{to death with a}} slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation. In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in Ilovaisk, Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt. On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.|$|E
500|$|Vivien's health {{declined}} rapidly after this. According to Vivien's {{friend and}} neighbor Colette, she ate almost nothing and drank heavily, even rinsing <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> perfumed water {{to hide the}} smell. Colette's account has led some to call Vivien an anorexic but this diagnosis did not yet exist at the time. Vivien was also addicted to the sedative chloral hydrate. In 1908 she attempted suicide by overdosing on laudanum and died the following year. In a memoir written fifty years later Barney said [...] "She could not be saved. Her life was a long suicide. Everything turned to dust and ashes in her hands." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth and <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up and looking out.|$|E

2500|$|Crandon used a {{trick in}} an attempt to fool psychical {{researchers}} that the [...] "spirit" [...] voices in her séances did not come from her own mouth. According to magician John Booth this was performed by Crandon filling <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> water before the séance had started and when the lights were turned off, swallowing the water. Before the end of the séance she would refill <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> water from a corked test tube. Crandon's reputation was also damaged when a fingerprint left on wax ostensibly by her channeled spirit, her deceased brother, Walter, was discovered to belong to her dentist Frederick Caldwell {{by a member of the}} Boston Society for Psychical Research. Her dentist divulged that he had taught her how to make these prints.|$|E
2500|$|After Emperor Gaozong's death {{around the}} new year 684, Li Zhe {{initially}} took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but in spring 684, after he showed signs of disobeying Empress Wu (who had become empress dowager and regent by that point), she deposed him and replaced him with his brother Li Dan (as Emperor Ruizong). [...] Empress Dowager Wu held power firmly and encouraged reports of treason. [...] In 688, a servant of Hao Chujun's grandson Hao Xiangxian (郝象賢) falsely accused Hao Xiangxian of plotting treason. [...] Empress Dowager Wu put {{one of her favorite}} secret police officers Zhou Xing (周興) in charge of the investigation. [...] Zhou found Hao Xiangxian guilty and sentenced him and his clan to death. [...] On the way to the execution field, Hao Xiangxian cursed Empress Dowager Wu and accused her of all kinds of adulterous and otherwise inappropriate behavior, and at one point jumped out of the cart and took firewood to combat the soldiers escorting him. [...] The soldiers killed him. [...] Empress Dowager Wu ordered that Hao Xiangxian's body be cut into pieces, and that Hao Chujun's and Hao Xiangxian's father's tombs be dug open, the caskets be destroyed, and the bones be burned. [...] From this point on, until Empress Dowager Wu's death, every time that a prisoner was to be executed, the executioners would stuff his or <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> a wooden sphere.|$|E

60|$|She {{turned to}} him with a splendid movement. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> was offered him, and her throat; her eyes were half-shut; her breast was tilted as if it asked for him.
