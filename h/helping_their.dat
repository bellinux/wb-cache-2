5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5|$|The Stamp Act was {{scheduled}} {{to go into effect}} on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign. Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax. By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> cause.|$|E

The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer {{is limited to a}} few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E
5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

25|$|The {{reluctance}} of Sicilian men to allow women to take paid work meant that women usually remained at home, their seclusion often increased {{due to the}} restrictions of mourning.

At the academy, young talented African footballers can work on their football skills. In addition to <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> football potential, the students are provided with formal education which is funded by Feyenoord. The Feyenoord Academy currently play their matches in the OneTouch Premier League.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Debs {{formed the}} American Railway Union (ARU) as an {{industrial}} organization {{in response to}} craft limitations. Railroad engineers and firemen had called a strike, but other employees, particularly conductors who were organized into a different craft, did not join that strike. The conductors piloted scab engineers on the train routes, <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> employers to break the strike. In June 1894, the newly formed, industrially organized ARU voted to join in solidarity with an ongoing strike against the Pullman company. The sympathy strike demonstrated the enormous power of united action, yet resulted in a decisive government response to end the strike and destroy the union.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Halbe was desperate for the Germans. Orders {{were still being}} issued to recognisable formations, but these were by now all mixed up. There was considerable tension between the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht troops, with both accusing the other of <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> own while ignoring {{the plight of the}} other. In Halbe itself, some of the civilians took pity on very young soldiers ("Kindersoldaten") and allowed them to change out of their uniforms into civilian clothes. In one documented case, an SS man appeared at the door of a cellar intending to shoot a Panzerfaust into a cellar with about 40 civilians and young Wehrmacht soldiers in it, only to be shot dead by one of the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in <b>helping</b> <b>their</b> clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E

500|$|Coronet Books {{released}} a novelisation of Last of the Summer Wine in 1974.

In the late 1980s, Roy Clarke wrote novels featuring Compo, Clegg and Seymour. The books were published by Penguin Books under the series heading Summer Wine Chronicles, and included such titles as Gala Week and The Moonbather. Clarke later adapted The Moonbather into a stage play.|$|E
