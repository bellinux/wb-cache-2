I couldn't spring so much.' <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very unlucky, Downey, about fourth novels, for the one I {{declined}} was ' Far From the Madding Crowd.' Of course, I hadn't seen it but even if I had it wouldn't have made any difference.|$|E
500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1970 book <b>I</b> <b>Seem</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> a Verb, he wrote: [...] "I live on Earth at present, and I don't {{know what}} I am. I know that I {{am not a}} category. I am not a thing—a noun. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a verb, an {{evolutionary}} process—an integral function of the universe." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{probing the}} very deeps of being, but indeed imperceptibly I fell asleep, and sat dreaming.|$|R

2500|$|Huckabee {{has stated}} that being criticized {{is a good sign}} for him because it means that he is a viable candidate. [...] Huckabee says of the {{political}} attacks, [...] "Suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the cross hairs of every predator who is out there," [...] Huckabee said. [...] "As a hunter, I know that a good hunter never aims his gun at a dead carcass. You only point it at something you want to put on the wall as a trophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the February 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, {{a number}} of benefit concerts were organised; Lisa Mitchell {{performed}} an unaccompanied set, supporting Tex Perkins, at the Ding Dong Lounge in Melbourne. TheDwarf.com.au reviewer, Matt Stewart, noted that for her gig she was [...] "wearing a velvet jacket, she says she realises it is hot but 'won't play without it', fair enough" [...] while [...] "Her voice shines" [...] he is disappointed by [...] "her biggest song and closer, [...] "Neopolitan Dreams", is without xylophone. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only one shattered by that, such an underused instrument in pop music these days".|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you laugh}} very much if I tell you {{of a dream}} that came to me last night--if it was a dream, for <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> still awake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} a hard time of it, child," [...] he said, [...] "though I knew nothing else, <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{conscious}} that you were always near me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet Edith, who <b>is</b> {{younger than}} <b>I,</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{too old for}} them: how do you arrange that? My mother's society will make me older," [...] Rose replied.|$|R
2500|$|Stoppard's later {{works have}} sought greater inter-personal depths, whilst {{maintaining}} their intellectual playfulness. Stoppard acknowledges that around 1982 he {{moved away from}} the [...] "argumentative" [...] works and more towards plays of the heart, as he became [...] "less shy" [...] about emotional openness. Discussing the later integration of heart and mind in his work, he commented [...] "I think I was too concerned when I set off, to have a firework go off every few seconds... I think I was always looking for the entertainer in myself and <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to entertain through manipulating language... it's really about human beings, it's not really about language at all." [...] The Real Thing (1982) uses a meta-theatrical structure to explore the suffering that adultery can produce and The Invention of Love (1997) also investigates the pain of passion. Arcadia (1993) explores the meeting of chaos theory, historiography, and landscape gardening.|$|E
60|$|JOY. Oh! Mother, {{you don't}} understand--I want you so; and <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nothing to you now.|$|E

60|$|All at once <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> acting without reason, {{for when}} I at last entered {{the grounds of}} the deserted caravansary, there <b>were</b> no evidences <b>to</b> justify my suspicions.|$|R
5000|$|Octavius (with an <b>i)</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the only}} {{form of this}} name found as a praenomen, {{although}} the form Octavus {{would be consistent with}} the adjective from which the name is derived.|$|R
60|$|The {{meeting had}} taken place and <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the only person in}} the room who was {{suffering}} from any sort of shock. Reggie was still holding one of Eve's hands and was almost incoherent.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the only}} one, however, who was {{borrowing}} any trouble {{on account of}} the proposed venture, and it can well be fancied that I held my peace, although I did a power of thinking.|$|R
50|$|The {{period after}} World War <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very turbulent. The {{independent}} Czechoslovak Republic was proclaimed on October 28, 1918; the Polish Republic on November 11. Silesia, mainly Cieszyn Silesia, became {{the eye of}} conflict between the two.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Corey sadly. [...] "I don't {{know anybody}} nowadays. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going to pieces every way. I don't call sixty-nine such {{a very great}} age." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Something {{is making}} him unhappy,' she thought. 'He is changed since I saw him last, and I can't get at it. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{so far from}} him--so far!' ...|$|E
60|$|For a time {{thereafter}} <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> entirely {{bereft of}} hope. I {{could see no}} ray of promise in the future--only immediate death for Juag and me, which didn't concern me much {{in the face of}} what lay in store for Dian.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I quite like it," [...] said Lydia. [...] "It seems like hypocrisy. It used to worry me. Sometimes I {{wondered}} if I had any real self. <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just what people made me, {{and a different}} person to each." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} lying prone upon {{a bed of}} yellowish, mosslike {{vegetation}} which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles. <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lying in a deep, circular basin, along the outer verge of which I could distinguish the irregularities of low hills.|$|R
6000|$|... "I daren't quite {{think about}} it yet. I mean to try. I must try. <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing an utterly contemptible, selfish part, but I could not marry him--now!" ...|$|E

60|$|As we sat {{enjoying the}} bivouac {{hospitality}} (the dish was really excellent and our host in a shabby grey jacket still looked the accomplished man-about-town) my eyes kept on straying towards that corner.

60|$|I {{looked and}} thrilled, though oppressed by the drear and desolate {{beauty of the}} scene around me, descended {{the wall and the}} ruined slope and made my way homewards, afraid even of my own shadow.

60|$|What in me rushed {{as if on}} wings {{into his}} silent company? A passionate longing beyond words burned in me. <b>I</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried away into a {{boundless}} wilderness--stunted trees, salt in the air, a low, enormous stretch of night sky, space; and this man, master of soul and solitude.|$|R
