[...] "I went around the outside to pass him and braked really late, and I think he spun. I'm not going to say it was {{completely}} Ralf's fault. I mean, we were racing and everything...I know I gave him plenty of room because I was right {{on the edge of the}} track. Because I braked so late, I nearly didn't even make the corner. I braked really late, just made the corner, and something hit me in the back. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, I saw Ralf." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's , [...] "Who You Are", was {{released}} to the US iTunes Store on 22 February 2011. [...] It is the song from the album of which she is proudest. It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. [...] "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I {{want to be a}} positive role model for young people. I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist," [...] she laughs. She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. So <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?' Music is my therapy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca {{has also}} {{recovered}} from an eating disorder, which she developed at around {{the age of}} 18. [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, I told myself 'My goodness, how fat. You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me." ...|$|E

50|$|Klinger {{stops by}} his office {{concerned}} {{that he is going}} insane. Sidney jokes thinking that this is nothing but an attempt to get a section 8, but Klinger states that he is serious ("I wake up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and see this man standing in a dress and I ask myself, 'Would a sane man dress like this?'").|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{is it all}} about, anyway, Reginald?" [...] {{his sister}} asked. [...] "I have heard more than once but I have forgotten. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper for a divorce case, I nearly always see your name against the King, or the King against you, with a person named Vont also interested. Surely the Vont family have been {{retainers}} down at Mandeleys for generations? I remember one of them perfectly well." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a glass {{over the}} mantel-piece in the anteroom. I lingered {{for a moment}} (nervous as I was) to see how <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass.|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped him}} {{on our way}} out to take {{advantage}} of my uncle's advice; in other words, to see how <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass over the vestry fireplace.|$|E
6000|$|Night {{after night}} in my sorrow [...] The stars stood over the sea, [...] Till lo! <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dusk [...] And a star {{had come down}} to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> Wish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eye. We {{wanted to}} scoff, {{and there was}} {{something}}, something perhaps in Clayton's voice and manner, that hampered our desire.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern sky there grew a cloud. At {{first it}} was small, though very black, but it {{gathered}} with extraordinary rapidity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} in my last" [...] (he wrote), [...] "that the {{discoloration}} of my skin had begun. The complexion which you were once so good as to admire, has disappeared for ever. I am now of a livid ashen color--so like death, that I sometimes startle myself when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. <b>In</b> about six weeks more, as the doctor calculates, this will deepen to a blackish blue; and then, 'the saturation' (as he calls it) will be complete.|$|R
60|$|With {{a sign to}} me to do likewise, Charles {{laid his}} hand firmly on the young man's shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fellow's face: {{there could be no}} denying it; Césarine's young man was Paul Finglemore, our broker's brother.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} he indicated I saw {{the cause of}} his perturbation. A mighty fleet of fliers was approaching majestically toward Kadabra {{from the direction of the}} ice-barrier. On and on they came with ever increasing velocity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} see him {{anywhere}} in the passage, or in any of our rooms. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study but, {{though he had been}} there, he had gone. He had, however [...] ." [...] He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{walking up}} to him, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, {{and at the same}} time tapped the handle of the big double-barrelled pistol I carried.|$|R
60|$|But though <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> papers <b>I</b> {{could find}} nothing except one little notice, which I {{cut out of}} an evening paper and which I put in here as a {{conclusion}} to my memoirs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! indeed. That thief of a clergyman, who got {{his finger}} into the pie of dead Mademoiselle, eh? Well, {{there are no more}} {{pickings}} here, Pasteur, but perhaps you come to have your fortune told. Shall <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crystal for you and tell you nice things about--what shall we say? About the past of that handsome Madame of yours, for instance? Oh! I will do it for love, yes, for love. Or shall I make that mummy speak for you? I can, for once I lived in that body of hers--it was a gay life," [...] and she stopped, gasping.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} came up close to the great chair on which I sat, and raising their frightful howl once more, tried to tear away the wooden rails that kept them from the ground beneath. I saw how <b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> faces of the two who were with me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. It was true, {{for there}} hung the ends down my shirt front. Then I {{struggled}} with the wretched thing until at last she had to help me, which she did laughing softly. Somehow her touch gave me confidence again and enabled me to say quite boldly that I only wanted my dinner.|$|E
60|$|She {{spoke of}} them warmly. Then, {{suddenly}} afraid, she drifted off again. I ate the omelette with cognac, {{which was very}} good, then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street. It was very dark, with bright stars, and smelled of snow. Two village men went by. I was tired, I {{did not want to}} go to the inn.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at him. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> popular phrase, I {{could hardly}} believe my own ears.|$|R
40|$|The causal {{powers that}} I have, {{such as the}} ability to go to the store for cold beer, for {{instance}} are the same causal powers as those had by the human animal closely associated with me. That is, the biological organism that invariably stares back at me, whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror. Thus, if I want to avoid gratuitous causal overdetermination – i. e. if I want to avoid positing two separate individuals with identical, and thus redundant, causal powers – as I justifiably do, then I should adopt animalism. That is, the view that I have the same persistence conditions as those had by a biological organism...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] sobbed Paula, [...] "Sister Mena saw her there. We {{were trying}} to get up croquet, and then I missed her. I tried to find her when the {{lightning}} began, but I could not find her anywhere, though <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> summer-houses!" ...|$|R
6000|$|When we {{went back}} to our lodgings to pack up, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass and saw what a smeary, bedraggled state my hat and head was in, from being rained on, I said to Jone, [...] "I don't see how those people ever let such a person as me have a room at their hotel." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went down}} the stairs, working up my temper all the way. When I got to the parlor I was in a fine frenzy {{concealed}} beneath a veneer of frigid courtesy. And when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> door, sure enough he had a Russia leather case in his hand. But I didn't happen to notice that it was our Russia leather case.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that," [...] Bill {{answered}} gravely. [...] "An' so, when I saw it run {{off across the}} snow, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow an' saw its tracks. Then I counted the dogs an' there was still six of 'em. The tracks is there in the snow now. D'ye {{want to look at}} 'em? I'll show 'em to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{guilty of}} robbing him; but I'm {{innocent}} of his blood!" [...] Mrs. Rook called after her wildly. [...] "The deed was done--the yard door was wide open, {{and the man}} was gone--when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> for <b>the</b> last time. Come back, come back!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{would never}} do to give him more; I felt I should become the fable of Kirkby-Lonsdale if I did; and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, sternly but still smiling, and {{addressed}} him with a voice of uncompromising firmness.|$|R
60|$|It was {{evening before}} I left Camberwell, and quite dark {{by the time}} I reached home. My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of seeing a note, but there was none.|$|R
