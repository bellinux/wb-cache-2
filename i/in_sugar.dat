40|$|Communication {{plays an}} {{important}} role in extension system. The communication efficiency also influences the job satisfaction and job commitment of an individual. The study was conducted in North Karnataka during the year 2008. This area was selected because more than 50 per cent of sugar factories are situated in north Karnataka and more sugar factories are situated in Bagalkot and Belgaum districts. From the study it was inferred that agricultural graduates had more communication efficiency as compared to non-agricultural graduates working <b>in</b> the private <b>sugar</b> factories and the agricultural graduates had more job satisfaction and job commitment <b>in</b> private <b>sugar</b> factories. Communication efficiency was highest in non-agricultural graduates <b>in</b> private <b>sugar</b> industries and lowest in agricultural graduates in cooperative industries. Agricultural graduates <b>in</b> private <b>sugar</b> industries had highest job satisfaction and agricultural graduates <b>in</b> cooperative <b>sugar</b> industries. While talking of job commitment non-agricultural graduates <b>in</b> private <b>sugar</b> industries had highest level of job commitment which was lowest in non-agricultural graduates <b>in</b> cooperative <b>sugar</b> industries...|$|R

5|$|Fruit is rich <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must}} be eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E

5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> prices because of overproduction.|$|E

In his maiden speech, he pushed for a 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation. Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> plantations, a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed. He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times.|$|E

5|$|In September 1740, as unrest rose {{among the}} Chinese population, spurred by {{government}} repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would {{be met with}} deadly force. On 7October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> mills throughout the area.|$|E
5|$|Olaf {{was a part}} of a {{rainy year}} in Mexico, {{producing}} more rain than Hurricane Nora. Although no deaths were reported, flooding caused serve damage to roadways and crops in the Mexican state of Jalisco. In the same state, more than 12,000 homes were damaged. In the state of Guanajuato, an estimated total of 15,000 people were impacted from the floods. In addition, two communities were isolated. After the hurricane, a program wanted donation from food to basic home supplies. Moisture from the remnants of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced a family to evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. It also spawned a tornado <b>in</b> <b>Sugar</b> Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E
5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} mammals {{have been}} introduced {{throughout the history of}} Puerto Rico. Indigenous settlers first introduced dogs and guinea pigs from South or Central America. Afterwards, Taínos introduced hutias as a food source from Hispaniola. When the Spanish colonized the island in the early 16th century, they introduced domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, goats, pigs, cattle, horses, and donkeys. Other species such as black rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus sp.) have been unintentionally introduced as stowaways, possibly since Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1493. More recently, species {{have been introduced}} as a means of biological pest control. For example, the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was introduced in the 19th century to control the damage caused by rats <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> cane plantations. The introduction was a failure: the mongoose failed to control the rat population and instead contributed to the decline of native fauna such as the yellow-shouldered blackbird and possibly the elfin-woods warbler.|$|E

5|$|The cyclone caused $50million {{in damage}} to the banana crop and $3million to papaws between Ingham to Cairns alone. Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton and pineapple farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the sugar industry, already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, costing $40million, 3.7million cases of bananas, costing $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, costing $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in avocados, lychees, custard apples, flowers, and chokos, as well. Effects to dairy and poultry industries were less severe, with losses reported at $2million and $600,000, respectively. Winds uprooted large swaths of forest, with $1million in damage at government-owned forests alone.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it <b>in</b> <b>sugar</b> or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
