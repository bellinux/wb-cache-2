500|$|When {{the news}} arrived in Buffalo that King had spiked the Red House batteries, General Smyth was overjoyed. [...] "Huzza!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "Canada <b>is</b> <b>ours!</b> Canada <b>is</b> <b>ours!</b> Canada <b>is</b> <b>ours!</b> This {{will be a}} glorious day for the United States!" [...] and he {{dispatched}} Colonel Winder with his 350 men across the river to evacuate King {{and the rest of}} his force. Winder collected Lieutenant Waring and his party and then landed. However, he had only disembarked part of his force when Bisshopp's 300 men appeared. Winder ordered his men back to their boats and cast off for Buffalo but his command came under a severe fire as they rowed away, costing him 28 casualties.|$|E

[...] With this, he gave special instructions to the cohorts to attack the horses' legs and thighs, since these were the only areas of the cataphracts which were not armored. Lucullus charged downwards along with his cohorts and his orders soon proved fatal: the lumbering cataphracts were caught by surprise and, in their attempts to break free from their attackers, careened into the ranks of their own men as the lines began to collapse.|$|E

500|$|The {{political}} situation in Lithuania, however, remained stable between October 1939 and March 1940. The Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs and the Russian soldiers were well-behaved in their bases. As late as March 29, 1940, Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov delivered a speech before the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union expressing his satisfaction with {{the execution of the}} mutual assistance treaties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. While Lithuanian politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union for its generosity and touted the [...] "traditional Soviet–Lithuanian friendship", in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence. The popular attitude was reflected in the slogan [...] "Vilnius – mūsų, Lietuva – rusų" [...] (Vilnius <b>is</b> <b>ours,</b> but Lithuania is Russia's).|$|E

[...] Bo {{and his team of}} municipal administrators also erected new Mao statues in Chongqing, while providing 'social security apartments' to the city's less well-off. Some scholars have characterized this {{as an example of the}} revival of Maoism in the Chinese Communist ethos.|$|E
500|$|San Martín made a brief {{reconnaissance}} of the royalist army, {{and noticed}} several flaws in their organization. Feeling secure of victory, {{he claimed that}} [...] "Osorio is clumsier than I thought. Today's triumph <b>is</b> <b>ours.</b> The sun as witness!". The battle began at 11:00 am. The patriot artillery on the right fired on the royalist infantry on the left. Manuel Escalada led mounted grenadiers to capture the royalist artillery, turning them against their owners. Burgos' regiment severely punished the patriot left wing, mainly composed of emancipated slaves, and took 400 lives. San Martín ordered the mounted grenadiers led by Hilarión de la Quintana to charge against the regiment. The firing suddenly ended and royalists began to fight with sword bayonets, under the cries [...] "Long live the king!" [...] and [...] "Long live the homeland!" [...] respectively. Finally, the royalists ended their cries and began to disperse.|$|E

500|$|On February 6, Grant wired Halleck: [...] "Fort Henry <b>is</b> <b>ours....</b> I shall {{take and}} destroy Fort Donelson on the 8th {{and return to}} Fort Henry." [...] This self-imposed {{deadline}} was overly optimistic due to three factors: miserable road conditions on the twelve-mile march to Donelson, the need for troops to carry supplies away from the rising flood waters (by February 8, Fort Henry was completely submerged), and the damage that had been sustained by Foote's Western Gunboat Flotilla in the artillery duel at Fort Henry. If Grant {{had been able to}} move quickly, he might have taken Fort Donelson on February 8. Early in the morning of February 11, Grant held a council of war in which all of his generals supported his plans for an attack on Fort Donelson, with the exception of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, who had some reservations. This council in early 1862 was the last one that Grant held {{for the remainder of the}} Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Meredith was {{partnered with}} George Livingstone for the 1903–04 campaign, {{who was able}} to supply him {{and the rest of the}} team with quality passes.

City then {{defeated}} Woolwich Arsenal and Middlesbrough to reach the semi-finals. There they faced The Wednesday at Goodison Park, and Meredith scored one goal (bundled in by Gillespie) and claimed two assists as City won the game 3–1. Their opponents in the final at Crystal Palace were mid-table Second Division outfit Bolton Wanderers, and Meredith was cautiously optimistic before the match, stating [...] "We ought to win... if we play anything like our normal game the cup <b>is</b> <b>ours...</b> but this is the cup final and, well, anything might happen." [...] With just over 20 minutes played, Livingstone found Meredith with a long ball, who then beat goalkeeper Dai Davies to score the only goal of the game; Bolton supporters long maintained that Meredith had been offside. As captain, Meredith was handed the trophy by Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.|$|E
500|$|Protests were {{scheduled}} for the film's Italian premiere in Viareggio, Italy, by unspecified organizations. The protesters objected to the plotline of a Partisan collaborating with the Nazis.

However, Lee, unrepentant, stated [...] "I am not apologizing." [...] He told Italians there was [...] "a lot about your history you have yet {{to come to grips}} with. This film is our interpretation, and I stand behind it." [...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, I understand what it's like for someone to tell your history... unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy <b>is</b> <b>ours</b> as well, and this was the best I could do... it is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E

When an active Tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its shields have been deactivated.

As the soldiers advance on the downed Tripod, a hatch opens releasing a liquid; a dying Martian struggles halfway out, and then dies immediately. Ray and Rachel reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie, who is revealed to be alive. The closing narration reveals that although the Martians were immune to the humans' weapons, their vegetation was not immune to the microbes present on Earth and that [...] "From the moment the invaders arrived, breathed our air, ate and drank, they were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God in his wisdom put upon this earth.

500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War <b>Is</b> <b>Ours,</b> was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world <b>is</b> <b>ours.</b> I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something.
