5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E
25|$|French {{continued}} to be dissatisfied at Smith-Dorrien's <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> army and in March was concerned {{that the rate of}} sickness was running at three times the rate in Second Army as in First.|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for {{building}} up an efficient administrative structure of the empire, that held together his vast realm. He organized an effective network of intelligence, partly a reason for his strong <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|Kisenosato {{is mainly}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi is hidari-yotsu, or right hand outside, left hand inside. His most common winning kimarite is yorikiri (force out), followed by oshidashi (push out) and tsukiotoshi (thrust over). He {{has been criticized}} for frequently stalling at the tachi-ai, or initial charge, in an attempt to unsettle his opponent.|$|E
25|$|Wakanohana {{was noted}} for his {{wide range of}} techniques, winning the prestigious Ginō-shō prize on six occasions. His {{favourite}} <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri, or force out, followed by oshidashi or push out. Together these two techniques accounted for almost fifty percent of his career victories. He had knowledge {{of a wide range}} of throwing moves, such as uwatenage (overarm throw), shitatenage (underarm throw), sukuinage (scoop throw) and kubinage (neck throw), as well as extremely rare techniques such as amiuchi (the fisherman's throw), kawazugake (hooking backward counter throw) and susoharai (rear footsweep).|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{pressure}} of Test cricket, Burke was an entertaining and attacking batsman, characterized by a clean line, quick movement back or forward and good balance, notably in playing the on-drive. Standing a little under six feet, Burke played with a low <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bat with little backlift. He played square-on while on the back foot, with chest facing the bowler, preferring to have his body behind swinging balls rather than the textbook side-on stance. Lantern jawed and poker faced, Burke showed little overt reaction to crowd sentiment over his batting approach, tugging his cap lower before every delivery. He {{was known for his}} sense of humour, often enlivening the team with his piano playing and jokes.|$|E

25|$|It is {{only now}} that Inigo Jones may have taken a firmer <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{original}} ideas. Seeing De Caus' completed wing standing alone as an entirety, it was considered too plain – De Caus' original plan was for the huge facade to have a low pitched roof, with wings finishing with no architectural symbols of termination. The modifications to the completed wing were of a balustrade hiding the weak roof line and Italianate, pavilion-like towers at each end. The focal point became not a portico but the large double height Venetian window. This south front (illustration above), has been deemed an architectural triumph of Palladian architecture in Britain, and {{it is widely believed}} that the final modifications to the work of De Caus were by Inigo Jones himself.|$|E
25|$|Gio González {{started his}} second {{game of the}} series and had a rocky outing. Chicago′s leadoff hitter, left fielder Jon Jay, doubled on his second pitch. He lost his <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> third pitch, and Jay {{advanced}} to third base when it sailed to the backstop. With one out, Jay scored on a ground-out by first baseman Anthony Rizzo to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead. González walked two more Cubs before {{getting out of the}} inning without further damage. In the bottom of the inning, with Chicago pitcher Kyle Hendricks making his second start of the series, Nationals shortstop Trea Turner led off with a double and advanced to third on a line out by left fielder Jayson Werth, but was thrown out at home while trying to score on a ground-out by right fielder Bryce Harper, and the Cubs preserved their early lead.|$|E
500|$|Although Constantine {{created his}} {{apparent}} heirs [...] "Caesars", following a pattern established by Diocletian, {{he gave his}} creations a hereditary character, alien to the tetrarchic system: Constantine's Caesars were {{to be kept in}} the hope of ascending to Empire, and entirely subordinated to their Augustus, {{as long as he was}} alive. Therefore, an alternative explanation for the execution of Crispus was, perhaps, Constantine's desire to keep a firm <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> prospective heirs, this—and Fausta's desire for having her sons inheriting instead of their half-brother—being reason enough for killing Crispus; the subsequent execution of Fausta, however, was probably meant as a reminder to her children that Constantine would not hesitate in [...] "killing his own relatives when he felt this was necessary".|$|E
50|$|As Ted {{begins to}} lose <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> both <b>his</b> sanity and his family, he seeks medical {{support for his}} {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder, but his financial situation does not allow him {{to pay for a}} treatment, and the government denies him. Ted enlists the aid of an equally unhinged psychic named Jake Witzky (Zachary Bennett) to help him understand his terrifying and relentless dreams. Jake encourages Ted {{to figure out what the}} burned man wants.|$|R
50|$|His {{most common}} winning kimarite or {{technique}} was yori-kiri or force out, where he preferred a right hand inside <b>grip</b> (migi-yotsu) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi or belt. He was also fond of hip throws like sukui nage (scoop throw) and uwate nage (overarm throw). He was only of average {{height and weight}} for the top division but had a notably muscular frame as he was a keen weight-lifter.|$|R
50|$|Fujinoshin {{employed}} {{a wide variety}} of techniques but was regarded by some commentators as a jack of all trades, master of none. He favoured a right hand outside, left hand inside <b>grip</b> (hidari-yotsu) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi or belt. His most common winning technique was yori-kiri (force out) but he also tried oshi-dashi (push out), hataki-komi (slap down), yori-taoshi (force out and down), uwate-nage (overarm throw), shitate-nage (underarm throw), uwatedashi-nage (pulling overarm throw) and katasukashi (armlock throw).|$|R
500|$|Asashōryū's favoured {{techniques}} {{according to}} his Sumo Association profile were migi-yotsu/yori, a left hand outside, right hand inside <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi (belt), and tsuppari, a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. His most common winning kimarite throughout his career were yorikiri (force out), oshidashi (push out), uwatenage (outer arm throw), shitatenage (inner arm throw) and tsukidashi (thrust out). He used 45 different kimarite in his career, a wider range than most wrestlers. In July 2009, he defeated Harumafuji by an [...] "inner thigh throw" [...] or yaguranage, a technique not seen in the top division since 1975. His trademark, however, was tsuriotoshi, or [...] "lifting body slam", a feat of tremendous strength normally only used on much smaller and weaker opponents. In 2004, Asashōryū twice dumped the [...] Kotomitsuki using this technique.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe I should have done it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E
2500|$|Takamisakari had a {{straightforward}} fighting style, rarely resorting to sidestepping {{at the initial}} charge. He favoured yotsu techniques, preferring a right-hand inside, left-hand outside <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi (migi-yotsu), and 26 of his 41 wins between July 2007 and May 2008 were by yori-kiri, or a simple force out. [...] He was also known for his effort and technique {{at the edge of}} the ring, which often allowed him to win matches in which just a moment earlier it appeared that he would be pushed out.|$|E
60|$|Just at this {{juncture}} the boy felt a slow, fateful <b>grip</b> closing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a rikishi may {{wear his}} mawashi {{in such a}} way as to give him some {{advantage}} over his opponent. He may wear it loosely to make it more difficult to be thrown, or he may wrap it tightly and splash a little water on it to help prevent his opponent from getting a good <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> it. <b>His</b> choice will depend on the type of techniques he prefers to employ in his bouts. Thus a wrestler preferring belt sumo will usually wear it more loosely, while those preferring pushing techniques will tend to wear the mawashi more tightly.|$|R
50|$|In 1891 {{he visited}} Europe, and was prostrated by {{an attack of}} the <b>grip</b> in California <b>on</b> <b>his</b> return. His health, which had {{previously}} been somewhat delicate, was thus undermined, and he failed gradually until his death, {{at his home in}} Honolulu, on April 10, 1892, in his 61st year.|$|R
2500|$|Kotoōshū was a {{tall and}} rather light rikishi at 203cm (6 feet, 8inches) and 152kg (334 pounds). In comparison, former yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono, at the same height, weighed 235kg (517 pounds) at his peak. [...] Yokozuna Asashōryū had about the same weight, but is only 184cm in height. Kotoōshū {{primarily}} relied on so-called 'belt-throws' to win his sumo bouts. He typically preferred to take a hidari-yotsu (left-hand inside <b>grip)</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi (the belt that is fixed around the wrestler's waist), although he was right-handed and his overall profile showed him preferring migi-yotsu (right-hand inside grip). He used his long arms and quick footwork to counteract his high center of gravity and relatively light weight. His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri, the force out, followed by uwatenage, the outer arm throw.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Chiyonofuji's {{trademark}} kimarite or {{technique was}} uwatenage, or overarm throw. He preferred a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi. His left hand outer grip was so effective that some commentators {{referred to it}} as his [...] "death grip." [...] Uwatenage was his second most common winning technique at sekitori level after yorikiri, or force out. He was also well known for tsuridashi, or lift out. He had knowledge {{of a wide range of}} other techniques as well, employing 41 different kimarite in his career. In January 1987, he won with the very rare amiuchi, or fisherman's net casting throw, and joked to the press afterwards that it was appropriate for him as he was the son of a fisherman. Chiyonofuji's muscular physique, athleticism and dramatic throws made him the most successful and one of the most popular wrestlers of his day.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Batra {{realized}} {{that one of}} his men had been shot. Turning his face toward Subedar Raghunath Singh, who was sitting behind a nearby boulder, maintaining an iron <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> AK-47, Batra shouted above the din of flying bullets: [...] "Aap aur main usko evacuate karenge," [...] (We wil evacuate him, you and I). With bullets flying around him, he pushed the JCO toward the safer side and taking his place instead, saying: [...] "You have a family and children to go back to, I'm not even married. Main sar ki taraf rahunga aur aap paanv uthayenge" [...] (I will take the head and you take his feet). Batra courageously exposed himself to enemy fire to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range and a split-second later, by a splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head. Captain Batra collapsed next to the injured soldier, succumbing to the fatal wounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Harvester," [...] David Langston, {{is a man}} of {{the woods}} and fields, who draws his living from the prodigal hand of Mother Nature herself. If the book had nothing in it but the splendid figure of this man, with <b>his</b> sure <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> life, <b>his</b> superb optimism, and his almost miraculous {{knowledge}} of nature secrets, it would be notable. But when the Girl comes to his [...] "Medicine Woods," [...] and the Harvester's whole sound, healthy, large outdoor being realizes that this is the highest point of life which has come to him--there begins a romance, troubled and interrupted, yet of the rarest idyllic quality.|$|R

[...] "Off!" [...] said Mr. Voules, and a concentrated fire came stinging Mr. Polly's face.|$|R

50|$|Michael's {{accession}} whetted {{the appetite}} {{of his former}} comrade-in-arms Thomas the Slav, who set himself up as rival emperor in Anatolia and successfully transferred his forces into Thrace, effectively besieging the capital in December 821. Although Thomas did not obtain the support {{of some of the}} Anatolian themes, he secured the support of the naval theme and their ships, allowing him to tighten <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Constantinople. In <b>his</b> quest for support, Thomas presented himself as the champion of the poor, reduced taxation, and concluded an alliance with Al-Ma'mun of the Abbasid Caliphate, having himself crowned Emperor by the Patriarch of Antioch Job.|$|R
5000|$|Jingaku was an {{exponent}} of tsuppari, {{a series}} of rapid thrusts to the opponent's chest, for which his Izutsu stable was famous, and often won by tsuki-dashi or thrust out. He used a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside <b>grip</b> when fighting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent's mawashi or belt, and yori-kiri (force out) was his most common winning kimarite. He was also known for using tsuri (lifting) techniques, and utchari, the ring edge pivot.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 July 2009, President Alan García {{named him}} as prime {{minister}} during the controversy surrounding indigenous clashes with the government when 34 people died. He was sworn-in at 8:00 pm on 12 July 2009. The appointment of Velásquez, considered a party loyalist, was seen by pundits as an attempt by García to tighten <b>his</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power for <b>his</b> final term. It is considered a reversal after appointing the leftist Yehude Simon, Velásquez's predecessor. [...] Velásquez is the third person to hold the office in nine months. Garcia, whose approval rating was 21 percent, also replaced the ministers of defense, justice, agriculture and the interior.|$|R
