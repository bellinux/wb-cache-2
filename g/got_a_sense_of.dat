5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave Captain America: The First Avenger a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump {{in the throat}} nostalgia, with Nazis – who make the best villains, and with loving references to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, [...] "I enjoyed the movie. I appreciated the 1940s period settings and costumes, which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes. I admired the way that director Joe Johnston propelled the narrative. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a broad story, rather than {{the impression of a}} series of sensational set pieces. If Marvel is wise, it will take this and Iron Man as its templates". A. O. Scott of The New York Times declared it [...] "pretty good fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} system proved difficult to develop because computers {{of the time}} lacked power. Artificial intelligence was considered crucial, as the navigation and other aspects relied on it. According to co-designer Jonty Barnes, the team wanted the creatures complex without high computational costs. Healey {{came up with the}} idea of slapping creatures to make them work faster, and Barnes considered it a [...] "great game decision". A great deal of time was spent working on the user interface, and at one point the idea of having no interface was considered. Carter stated that the team tried to make the sounds atmospheric and industrial so players <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> power. Using others' 3D sound routines proved troublesome, so he and his colleague Tony Cox wrote their own. Dungeon Keeper uses lighting algorithms used in Magic Carpet, which provided effects such as fireballs lighting corridors.|$|E
60|$|Nonsense. I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> effect, and I always {{cultivate}} the dramatic situation.|$|R
60|$|Looking {{down upon}} the floor and its {{increasing}} swarm of individuals, Bradley <b>got</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> its vastness and its complexity and noise.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're domestic," [...] he said, [...] "and fond {{of their}} children, and {{pleasant}} neighbors. I don't deny that they've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> tremendous <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty, {{but we want}} that in these days." ...|$|R
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I {{like the way he}} played it. ... I think he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and he's got some good things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in Britain, Lloyd Webber {{teamed up}} with record company {{executive}} Colin Barlow, {{who has worked with}} the likes of Take That and Girls Aloud, having had 15 number ones and sold over 40 million albums as a producer, to help select the lucky six performers who will progress to the live shows. After seeing a number of entries sent into the BBC by the people, getting a [...] "fabulous look at people's living rooms" [...] as Norton said, we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> who may be the future qualifiers to the live shows. After a number of auditions and workshops, showing some potential qualifiers rehearsing at their homes and elsewhere, the final six qualifiers were finally introduced. They were five-piece [...] "man band" [...] the Emperors of Soul, twins Francine and Nicola Gleadall and soloists Damien Flood, Charlotte Finlay, Mark Evans and Jade Ewen.|$|E
2500|$|On July 25, 2006, Colbert {{responded to}} {{television}} networks—specifically Fox News, NBC's The Today Show and ABC's Good Morning America—which took {{comments made by}} Florida Congressman Robert Wexler on The Colbert Report out of context (e.g.: [...] "I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do."). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he [...] "say some things that would really lose the election for [...] if [...] were contested." [...] Colbert criticized the major networks' morning news shows that featured the interview in a misleading and a negative light, by showing clips {{from many of the}} [...] "fluff" [...] pieces they favored instead of [...] "real" [...] news. Colbert subsequently told his viewers to [...] "vote Wexler, the man's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor, unlike, evidently, journalists." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{collapsed}} into his arms. The liberating shock was {{as great as}} had been her terror. She began to tremble violently. Her hands <b>got</b> back <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> strength to clutch. Heart and blood seemed released from that ice-banded vise.|$|R
5000|$|According to Madison Taylor, {{an editor}} of Times-News, the serial has detractors and fans among the paper readers. Some dislike serials, some desire more humor and less intrigue. Some like it because [...] "it’s {{different}} than anything else" [...] Times-News publishes and [...] "it's also <b>got</b> <b>an</b> quirky <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor." ...|$|R
50|$|Harey (Nepali:हरे), Ashok's {{childhood}} friend, {{who later}} becomes {{a friend of}} both Ashok and Katha. But unlike Ashok, he didn't go to school so was unemployed before he meets Katha. He represents an innocent voice of unemployed youth of countryside. He has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and makes story often humorous.|$|R
6000|$|JAMES. You've still <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> your superiors. Didn't {{you notice}} how you moved to Poulder's orders, me boy; an' {{when he was}} gone, to mine? ...|$|E
60|$|The sun {{had sunk}} behind the range, {{and the sky}} was green. In places the high white peaks were touched by fading pink; the snow that rolled down to the timber-line was blue. Mist floated about the pines by the river, but did not reach the hotel terrace, and the evening was warm. Looking down at the dark valley, one <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> space and height.|$|E
60|$|Kit {{liked the}} engine-room. The steady {{beat of the}} machine was soothing. One <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> order, {{measured}} effort and strength that matched the strain. Force was not wasted but sternly controlled. In the engine-room Macallister was another man, quiet, keen, concentrated, and Kit understood the Scots' satisfaction when all ran well. They sprang from a stock that counted rule and effort to be worth more than beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{rather an}} awful little man," [...] the grey girl {{said when they}} had {{achieved}} the crossing of the street; [...] "but he's <b>got</b> quite <b>a</b> nice <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour." ...|$|R
5000|$|Willis {{also worked}} on the Allen films Interiors (1978), Stardust Memories (1980), A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), Zelig (1983), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), and The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985). Allen said that working with Willis had helped to improve his {{technical}} skills, saying of him: [...] "He's <b>an</b> artist. He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor--he taught me a lot." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sookie sees Dahlia as very [...] "direct in her judgement". She also {{mentions}} that Dahlia behaves [...] "regally" [...] {{in the company}} of the Queen Sophie-Anne.Dahlia is supremely confident in her strength, wits and lethality. She is usually very composed and has a violent, vengeful nature. Dahlia is seen smiling only rarely (usually before a good battle), but she has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. Immediately after her husband's death she experiences difficulties with controlling her temper.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Wyndham, [...] "not much light. For a few hours, {{the glare}} was dazzling, {{but soon the}} shadow crept back from the bush and the fever-mist floated about the boat. On the creek and at the village, you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> gloom that never melted." [...] He paused and added with a smile: [...] "It's often {{like that in the}} tropics, and the gloom is not {{altogether}} physical." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet Stannard was athletic, and at Parisian {{clubs and}} Swiss hotels men {{talked about his}} fencing and his {{exploits}} on the rocks. He was not a big man, but now his thin jacket was open, the moulding of his chest and the curve to his black silk belt were Greek. All the same, one rather <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> cultivation than strength; Stannard looked thoroughbred, and Jimmy was proud he was his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not yet, {{he paints}} just like Pissarro. He hasn't found himself, but he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> colour {{and a sense}} of decoration. But that isn't the question. It's the feeling, and that he's got. He's behaved like a perfect cad to his wife and children, he's always {{behaving}} like a perfect cad; the way he treats the people who've helped him--and sometimes he's been saved from starvation merely by the kindness of his friends--is simply beastly. He just happens to be a great artist." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Salta, teams {{made their way}} to follow a series of Road Signs to locate the next clue, sending them to Aerodormo Gilberto Lavaque in Cafayate for the Roadblock, asking [...] "Who's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> direction?". One team member had to use a provided map to navigate to a skydiving drop zone; meanwhile, the other team member had to board an airplane and tandem skydive to that location. Once the team was reunited, the jump master gave them their next clue.|$|R
60|$|She had {{consented to}} the sale of their farm in Illinois with great reluctance, and, as Burke rode along on his load of furniture, he {{recalled}} it all very vividly, and it made him anxious to know her impression of his claim. As he took her position for <b>a</b> moment, he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the loneliness and rawness of this new land which he had not felt before. The woman's point of view was so {{different from that of}} the adventurous man.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the pilot}} was shot, {{producers}} decided that they needed a regular comedian on the show, so Rip Taylor was brought aboard to portray the Bradys' realtor, moving man, next-door-neighbor, general Jack-of-all-trades and Alice's boyfriend, Mr. Merrill. Like Reischl, Taylor felt welcomed by the cast—with the exception of Ann B. Davis, who barely spoke to him except when they were doing scenes. [...] "Rip Taylor is a salty guy," [...] commented series writer Mike Kagan, [...] "he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> dirty <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and Ann B. Davis is a born-again Christian." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{understood}} that the main object of my trip to England was {{to find out whether}} the British people have any sense of humour. No doubt the Geographical Society had this investigation in mind in not paying my expenses. Certainly on my return I was at once assailed with the question on all sides, [...] "Have they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour? Even if it is only a rudimentary sense, have they got it or have they not?" [...] I propose therefore to address myself to the answer to this question.|$|E
60|$|The {{party in}} the gun-room were silent while they waited for Jim. Mrs. Halliday glanced at the others curiously and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> strain. Dick, looking {{disturbed}} but resolute, leaned against the table opposite Mordaunt, whose face was rather white; Bernard occupied the bench by the wall and his look was inscrutable. All was very quiet except for the snapping of the stove and the occasional rattle of a cinder falling through the bars. It {{was something of a}} relief when Jim came in and Bernard turned on the light.|$|E
60|$|After a {{few moments}} Jimmy heard Deering's laugh and Stannard's party crossed the floor. Frank Dillon talked to Laura, whom Jimmy had not seen since he returned; Frank was rather a handsome, {{athletic}} young fellow. Laura wore a fashionable black dinner dress and her skin, by contrast, was very white. Her movements were languidly graceful, and Jimmy <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> high cultivation. He was young and to know he belonged to Laura's party flattered him. Yet he was half embarrassed, because he waited for other guests {{and did not know}} if Laura would like his friends. When she gave Jimmy her hand Stannard indicated two extra chairs.|$|E
5000|$|The verses to [...] "Blasphemous Rumours" [...] {{describe}} a 16-year-old girl who attempts suicide but fails. She experiences a religious revival but is {{killed in a}} car accident aged 18 and dies. The chorus uses these incidents to conclude, [...] "I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours / but I think that God's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sick <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour / and when I die, I expect to find him laughing." [...] Like other songs on Some Great Reward, the song uses a dense sound with extensive sampled percussion.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's beautiful?" [...] cried Sir Isaac in protesting scorn. [...] "What's noble? ROT! Doing {{your duty}} {{if you like}} and being sensible, that's noble and beautiful, but not {{fretting}} about and running yourself into danger. You've <b>got</b> to have <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour, Elly, in this life----" [...] He created a quotation. [...] "As you make your bed--so shall you lie." ...|$|R
2500|$|UGO.com ranked him in {{its list}} of top 11 [...] "silver screen psychos", saying that [...] "Chigurh is an assassin of little words and {{interesting}} choices of weaponry - is a man without <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. Others might say he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> warped <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> principles. One thing that most can agree on, is Chigurh is one crazy S.O.B. - ruthlessly killing damn near anyone who sets eyes on him, let alone those who get in his way. And apparently, {{the only way you}} can survive a run in with the man is the 50-50 chance of a coin toss, but dear god, don't question his motives, it just seems to irritate him even more so." ...|$|R
60|$|To some extent, Kit's first voyage {{on board}} Mossamedes was disappointing, {{and he felt}} as if he had been cheated. Nothing romantic marked the run; the boat was large, her roll was slow and regular, and while her big engines pushed her north against the Trade-breeze, one could without much {{balancing}} walk the deck. On board Campeador one could not. Her sharp plunges sent one staggering about, and one must dodge the spray that swept her like a hailstorm when the white surges burst against her forecastle. The spray and violent motion had some drawbacks, but Kit <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> man's struggle with the sea.|$|E
60|$|Yusuf {{went with}} him to the door, and Kit {{starting}} along the street, heard the heavy bolts shoot back. To know the business was over was something of a relief. Although Yusuf was inscrutable at his house one <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fear and secrecy. In Morocco a Jew trader was perhaps forced to use caution, but Kit thought he would sooner deal with the wild Berbers who ruled the open desert. Yet he owned he had no firm grounds for doubting Wolf's agent. When he got on board Mossamedes he went to the chart-room and found Don Erminio playing cards with the mate. The captain had won two pesetas and was jubilant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, they roosted {{around here}} on the housetop and the trees for an hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings. It ain't any use to tell me a bluejay hasn't <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor, because I know better. And memory, too. They brought jays here {{from all over the}} United States to look down that hole, every summer for three years. Other birds, too. And they could all see the point except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on his way back. He said he couldn't see {{anything}} funny in it. But then he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too." ...|$|E
60|$|Marston {{gave him}} a quick glance and then got to work. He doubted if the gear would stand the strain, but Harry knew the boat. Although the Krooboys looked surprised, {{it was obvious that}} they trusted him. It cost them a {{struggle}} to cover her with sail, and she drove along almost too fast to roll. A white wave stood up above her waist, another curled astern, and the hollow squaresail swelled like a balloon. Although the sea was smooth, water foamed on board and spray swept the deck in savage showers. The men crouched behind the bulwarks and when Marston went aft he <b>got</b> <b>an</b> exhilarating <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> speed.|$|R
50|$|I'd {{never heard}} of Ozella before, but I like his art here. It’s exactly in Segar's style, with the rounded heads, wiggly lines {{radiating}} out of people’s heads, and gruff expressions. Bluto just radiates menace, and his assistant looks like a huge slab of beef just ready to attack. He’s <b>got</b> <b>a</b> fun <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> motion for his characters, with Popeye's arms whirling around like a windmill, or {{the way that he}} leaps and bounds through the air. It’s completely in character with what Segar did before, but it also manages to keep from feeling old-fashioned or less than natural; that’s a feat that few comic artists can manage when mimicking another artist’s style.|$|R
5000|$|Speleers was {{selected}} for the title role after a worldwide casting search. [...] "Ed came in the casting session, and we just {{looked at each other}} and said, [...] "That's Eragon, that's the guy from the book," [...] said director Stefen Fangmeier: [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Ed's sparkle, of his life. It's the kind of thing where you just know he's destined to become a movie star. Speleers won the role as he was trying to learn his lines for a school production of Hamlet. Others considered for the role included Alex Pettyfer but since production took place in central Europe and Pettyfer is afraid of flying, he declined the role.|$|R
