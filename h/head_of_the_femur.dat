40|$|Background: Caudal {{regression}} syndrome (CRS) {{is a rare}} complex {{congenital anomaly}} which is characteri zed by agenesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacral and lumbar spine. Pelvis, lower extremity, genitourinary, cardiac anomalies and lower extremity neurological and motor development deficits may be accompanied. The exact etiology is unclear but the maternal insulindependent diabetes mellitus (hyperglycaemia during embryogenesis seems {{to act as a}} teratogen), genetic factors, vascular hypoperfusion {{may play a role in}} the etiology. Case: A 41 -year-old gravida 4, para 2, live 1, abortus 1 patient with 35 weeks <b>of</b> gestation. <b>The</b> patient had 12 -year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus. In ultrasonographic examination we found <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bones (all the upper and lower bones) 8 weeks underdeveloped and didn’t observe the lumbar, sacral vertebrae and iliac bones.

25|$|Hip {{modification}} surgeries include excision arthroplasty, {{in which}} the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> is removed and reshaped or replaced, and pelvic rotation (also known as triple pelvic osteotomy, or pubic symphodesis) {{in which the}} hip socket is realigned, may be appropriate if done early enough. These treatments can be very effective, but as a rule tend to become less effective for heavier animals - their ability to treat the problem becomes reduced if the joint has to handle more pressure in daily life. Pelvic rotation is also not as effective if arthritis has developed {{to the point of}} being visible on X-rays.|$|E
25|$|All titanosaurs {{had what}} is called wide-gauge posture, a {{relative}} term to describe a stance in which the feet fell apart from the body midline. More derived titanosaurs had {{a greater degree of}} wide-gauge posture, with their limbs held more widely than their ancestors and contemporaneous counterparts. The stance of Dreadnoughtus schrani was clearly wide-gauge, but not to the degree of saltasaurids because the femoral condyles are perpendicular to its shaft rather than beveled. This {{and the fact that the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> was not turned in towards the body as in saltasaurids support the phylogenetic conclusion that Dreadnoughtus was not a saltasaurid. The animal’s broad sternal bones also demonstrate a wide pectoral girdle, giving it a broad-shouldered, broad-chested appearance. Paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara compared the animal's gait to an Imperial Walker.|$|E
25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because {{with the passage of time}} the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum.|$|E
50|$|The {{blood supply}} to the femoral head and neck is {{enhanced}} by <b>the</b> artery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ligamentum teres derived from the obturator artery.

The treatment period in the arc technique is 13. 7 % shorter than in the IMRT technique. Comparing <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IMRT and arc techniques (arc vs. IMRT), the mean values were 29. 21 ± 12. 91 Gy versus 28. 36 ± 13. 79 Gy for the bladder, 20. 36 ± 3. 16 Gy versus 18. 17 ± 5. 11 Gy for the right femoral head, and 18. 98 ± 3. 28 Gy versus 16. 67 ± 5. 15 Gy for the left femoral head. For the rectum, lower values were obtained after application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arc technique, not the IMRT technique: 35. 84 ± 12. 28 Gy versus 35. 90 ± 13. 05 Gy.

50|$|For {{the last}} 45 years the most {{successful}} and common form <b>of</b> arthroplasty is <b>the</b> surgical replacement <b>of</b> arthritic or destructive or necrotic joint or joint surface with prosthesis.

This would involve replacing both the acetabulum (hip socket) and <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this procedure is to relieve pain, to restore range of motion and to improve walking ability, thus leading to <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> muscle strength.|$|R
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur),</b> through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), {{and down to the}} center of the ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of {{the tip of the}} greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} <b>the</b> {{evolution}} <b>of</b> systemic juvenile arthritis (JA) in adult patients. Subjects and methods. The trial covered 19 patients (7 men, 12 women; mean age 28. 8 + 9. 1 years) with systemic JA {{who had fallen}} ill in childhood (at <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 1 to 16 years). <b>The</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease was 11 to 53 years (mean 24. 7 + 11. 4 years). Its systemic manifestations at the onset included fever (n = 18), rash (n = 8), lymphadenopathy (n = 7), hepatolienal syndrome (n = 8), pericarditis (n = 1). At the onset, oligoarthritis was present in 9 (47. 4 %) patients; polyarthritis was in 7 (36. 8 %) and 3 patients had only arthralgies. Results and discussion. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> systemic manifestations was decreased over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease and they were detected only in 3 patients by <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial. At the examination, almost half (n = 9) had no active arthritis, 10 had inflammatory changes in the joints. At the trial, <b>the</b> total scores <b>of</b> inflammatory disease activity were retained {{in the vast majority}} (n = 17); however, its magnitude was low or modest. The mean HAQ score was 1. 2. More than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients had retarded physical development or disproportionate body build. X-ray changes were absent or minimal in 4 patients; there were erosions in 5, ankyloses in 3, and Stage IV sacroiliitis in 2. Six patients presented with aseptic necrosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and humerus. Nine patients received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 7 took glucocorticoids, and 7 had disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, mainly methotrexate. At the study, the disease activity steadily remained low in 5 patients; 1 patient achieved complete remission; an exacerbation was seen in 13 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19 patients. 5 -to- 23 -year remissions were recorded in 11 (57. 9 %) patients over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. Conclusion. The patients with long-term JA tend to develop polyarthritis. Despite the severity, remaining inflammatory activity, and recurrent course <b>of</b> arthritis, <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> its systemic and articular manifestations is reduced in most patients over time. During the disease, there may be long-term remissions; however, one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients develop an erosive process and almost half do aseptic necrosis, which is the ground to continue active therapy...|$|R
500|$|Most {{bones of}} the postcranial skeleton, {{including}} the {{bones of the}} hands, feet, vertebral column, ribs, radius (lower arm bone), tibia, and fibula, have not been found for Archaeoindris. [...] As with many cranial features, the postcranial bones that have been discovered are similar to that of Palaeopropithecus, but significantly larger and more robust. [...] The <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> was large and lacked a fovea capitis femoris (a small depression in the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur).</b> [...] The femur was short and extremely robust, had a very high collodiaphyseal angle (the angle of the neck and shaft of the bone), and the greater trochanter was small. [...] In the adult, the humerus was significantly longer than the femur, while in the immature specimen, both the humerus and ulna were much longer than the femur, making the arms considerably longer than the legs, as also seen in Palaeopropithecus. [...] The relative length of the arms to the legs was shorter in Archaeoindris, so although its intermembral index was over 100, it was lower than that of Palaeopropithecus.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these fragmentary teeth, the Maevarano Formation has also yielded a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of an immature, cat-sized mammal {{that has not yet}} been fully described. It is the most complete mammal known from the Mesozoic of Gondwana. Its skull is damaged, but its unusual dentition is preserved. The incisors (two {{on each side of the}} upper and one on each side of the lower jaw) project forwards and are separated from the three or four cheektooth in each side of the lower and upper jaws by a large diastema (gap). It shows primitive features, such as the presence of epipubic bones (in the pelvis), a septomaxilla (a small bone placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla in the upper jaw), and a deep zygomatic arch (cheekbone). On the other hand, it has derived traits like the presence of a well-developed trochlea on the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone), the absence of a rim at the dorsal (upper) margin of the acetabulum (the opening in the pelvis which receives the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur),</b> a small lesser trochanter of the femur (upper leg bone), reduced contact between the fibula (the smaller of the two lower leg bones) [...] and the calcaneum (heel bone), and the dentition.

MATERIAL In the present study a total of 314 patients have been re-examined between four and five years after the first review. If patients known to have died and patients whose Judet operations had failed completely are excluded, this represents a follow-up of 77 per cent. This figure is well below that achieved last time.
