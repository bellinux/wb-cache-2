5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment <b>in</b> <b>which</b> an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E

5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and <b>in</b> <b>which</b> both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E

5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
