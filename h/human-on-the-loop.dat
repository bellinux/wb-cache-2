40|$|ABSTRACT | For future {{systems that}} require {{one or a}} small team of {{operators}} to supervise a network of automated agents, automated planners are critical since they are faster than hu-mans for path planning and resource allocation in multivariate, dynamic, time-pressured environments. However, such plan-ners can be brittle and unable to respond to emergent events. Human operators can aid such systems by bringing their knowledge-based reasoning and experience to bear. Given a decentralized task planner and a goal-based operator interface for a network of unmanned vehicles in a search, track, and neutralize mission, we demonstrate with a <b>human-on-the-loop</b> experiment that humans guiding these decentralized planners improved system performance by up to 50 %. However, those tasks that required precise and rapid calculations were not significantly improved with human aid. Thus, there is a shared space in such complex missions for humanâ€“automation collaboration...|$|E
