5000|$|Bevis soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a speedy right-winger and made 31 appearances in the 1937-38 season, scoring five goals. In the following season he only missed five matches, making 37 appearances and scoring six goals, including a [...] "spectacular" [...] hat-trick in a 3-1 victory at Swansea Town on 1 April 1939. His crosses also laid on scoring opportunities for the central forwards Reg Tomlinson and Fred Briggs who scored 12 and 14 league goals respectively, as the [...] "Saints" [...] finished 18th in the table, four points above the relegation zone. At the end of the season, Newcastle United made an <b>enquiry</b> <b>about</b> Bevis's <b>availability.</b>|$|R
50|$|At 05.19 hrs on Tuesday 5 January 1993, Lerwick {{coastguard}} {{were advised}} that the tanker, Braer, {{en route from}} Bergen, Norway to Quebec, Canada, laden with 85,000 tonnes of Norwegian Gullfaks crude oil, had lost engine power but was in no immediate danger. Her estimated position then was 10 miles (19 km) south of Sumburgh Head and she was drifting in predominantly southwesterly winds of force 10-11. The coastguard alerted rescue helicopters from Sumburgh and RAF Lossiemouth, and made <b>enquiries</b> <b>about</b> the <b>availability</b> of local tugs. At the Coast Guard's suggestion, the master agreed that non-essential personnel should {{be removed from the}} vessel—14 of the 34 crew were taken off by the coastguard helicopter from Sumburgh at 08:25.|$|R
50|$|After {{losing a}} regular place at Tranmere, Shrewsbury Town made an <b>enquiry</b> <b>about</b> Mangan's <b>availability</b> {{in the next}} {{transfer}} window. He rejoined the club on an 18-month contract on 7 January 2016. He made his return debut in an FA Cup tie away at Cardiff City three days later, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory, sending Shrewsbury through to the fourth-round {{for the first time}} since 2002-03. He missed a penalty on his home return against Barnsley, but scored a second-half equaliser at Burton Albion the following week, with Shrewsbury going on to win 2-1 at the league leaders. Mangan scored five goals in nineteen league appearances in the second half of the 2015−16 season to help the club avoid relegation to League Two. During the 2015−16 season Mangan received the PFA community champion as recognition for his work with children in the Shrewsbury area.|$|R
500|$|On 24 July 2011, Hooper had {{a penalty}} saved by Graham Stack in Celtic's first match of the 2011–12 season, a 2–0 win over Hibs. On 13 August, he scored his first {{goal of the}} season in a 5–1 win over Dundee United. He also picked up an ankle injury which ruled him out for the next two matches. On 25 August he made his return in Celtic's 3–1 loss to FC Sion. Three days later, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win over St Mirren. English Premier League clubs Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers {{expressed}} interest in signing Hooper on transfer deadline day of summer 2011, however Celtic rejected their <b>enquiries</b> <b>about</b> his <b>availability.</b> Hooper's regular strike partner Anthony Stokes said [...] "He's a top, top player. I have no doubt one day he could play at the very top level but we want to keep him here as long as possible." ...|$|R
500|$|Several of the opera's novel features, {{including}} the use of a large amateur orchestra, and specifically its use of handbells, posed problems for Britten's publishers, Boosey & Hawkes. Ernst Roth made <b>enquiries</b> <b>about</b> the <b>availability</b> of handbells to the firm Mears & Stainbank (the bell foundry based in Whitechapel, London), and then wrote to Britten urging him to prepare an alternative, simplified version of Noye's Fludde for publication, since the rarity of handbells in the scale of E flat made the original score, in his view, impractical. Britten resisted such a proposal: [...] "I think if you consider a performance of this work in a big church with about fifty or more children singing, you will agree that the orchestra would sound totally inadequate if it were only piano duet, a few strings and a drum or two." [...] Britten suggested, rather, that Boosey & Hawkes should invest in a set of E flat handbells to hire for performances; or, that the handbells music could be simply cued in the piano duet part.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of studies finding low levels of <b>enquiry</b> <b>about</b> abuse by clinicians in the U. S. A. and the U.

All information regarding clients' abuse histories contained within the files was noted. The results suggest that <b>enquiry</b> <b>about</b> abuse is not routinely taking place. Assessments conducted using a form with an abuse section identified significantly greater prevalence rates of abuse than assessments conducted without the form. When notes in the current chart from previous contacts with mental health services were included, a prevalence rate of 46 % for childhood and/or adulthood abuse was calculated. Only approximately half of this abuse, however, was identified in the notes of the current admission. Recommendations are proposed regarding the need for unit policies ensuring routine <b>enquiry</b> <b>about</b> abuse in standardised admission procedures, and for providing clinicians with training in {{how and when to}} enquire about abuse, and how to respond...|$|R
