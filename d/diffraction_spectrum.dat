40|$|The {{translation}} {{action of}} ^d on a translation bounded measure ω {{leads to an}} interesting class of dynamical systems, with a rather rich spectral theory. In general, the <b>diffraction</b> <b>spectrum</b> of ω, which is the carrier of the diffraction measure, live on {{a subset of the}} dynamical spectrum. It is known that, under some mild assumptions, a pure point <b>diffraction</b> <b>spectrum</b> implies a pure point dynamical spectrum (the opposite implication always being true). For other systems, the <b>diffraction</b> <b>spectrum</b> can be a proper subset of the dynamical spectrum, as was pointed out for the Thue-Morse sequence (with singular continuous diffraction) in EM. Here, we construct a random system of close-packed dimers on the line that have some underlying long-range periodic order as well, and display the same type of phenomenon for a system with absolutely continuous spectrum. An interpretation in terms of `atomic' versus `molecular' spectrum suggests a way to come to a more general correspondence between these two types of spectra.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{diffraction}} properties of lattice dynamical systems of algebraic origin. It is well-known that diverse dynamical properties occur within this class. These include different orders of mixing (or higher-order correlations), {{the presence or}} absence of measure rigidity (restrictions on the set of possible shift-invariant ergodic measures to being those of algebraic origin), and different entropy ranks (which may be viewed as the maximal spatial dimension in which the system resembles an i. i. d. process). Despite these differences, it is shown that the resulting <b>diffraction</b> <b>spectra</b> are essentially indistinguishable, thus raising further difficulties for the inverse problem of structure determination from <b>diffraction</b> <b>spectra.</b> Some of them may be resolved on the level of higher-order correlation functions, which we also briefly compare.

Mathematical expressions for the best mask (object space) focus position and for the required correction of mask pattern size are derived. When the mask focus is positioned in the equivalent plane of the multilayer, the amount of pattern shift is reduced. When the mask pattern size is corrected using the derived formula, taking a space pattern with the target CD of 22 nm as an example, the imaging CD bias between different oriented features is below 0. 3 nm...|$|E
