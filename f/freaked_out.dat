25|$|After reports had {{surfaced}} {{that both}} parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling {{to comply with the}} Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent: We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight. Arum told David Mayo of the Grand Rapids Press.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song.

500|$|After {{a number}} of concerts in D.C. opening for bands such as the Untouchables, the Idles decided to tour the West Coast in August 1980. Along with roadies Garfield and Sullivan, the band {{traveled}} to California. They were immediately hassled by police upon their arrival, and after challenging the police, Nelson was handcuffed for an hour. When the Teen Idles eventually began their tour, they were refused entry at Los Angeles' Hong Kong Café because of their age. Originally due to open for the Dead Kennedys and the Circle Jerks, they settled for playing the next night, opening for the Mentors and a band called Puke, Spit and Guts in exchange for just $15. The Teen Idles impressed those at the venue; MacKaye later said, [...] "People were <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> by how fast [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Although {{alternative}} {{options to}} {{doing business with}} China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: [...] "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> {{about what is going}} on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is our legal system, but people fear that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E

NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
500|$|... "See You Again" [...] is a pop rock {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and ten seconds. The songs {{contains}} numerous influences from electronic, new wave, and techno music. The song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time and has a fast tempo of 138 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor and Cyrus' vocals span one octave, from G3 to A4. Throughout the song, Cyrus' edgy and sultry vocal performance maintains in the contralto range. The lyrics of [...] "See You Again" [...] are about a teenage romance. In verses, Cyrus discusses her sentiments and perceptions about her love interest, such as believing the couple had previously encountered in a previous incarnation. [...] "See You Again"'s refrains detail previous scenes of an encounter between the couple: [...] "The last time I <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> / I just kept looking down / I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I’m thinking ‘bout." [...] Towards the conclusion of the refrains, Cyrus vows to redeem herself.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} met with {{extremely}} positive critical reception. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the series premiere four out of four stars, commenting that it was as [...] "involving as any new drama and funnier than any new sitcom [...] matches high visual style with a witty-but-never arch sensibility." [...] He highlighted the performances of the six leading actresses, writing, [...] "Individually, each is terrific; combined, they're an irresistible feminine force", and praised Hatcher's [...] "revelatory performance." [...] Bianco also noted that Cherry avoided making the pilot campy. The San Francisco Chronicle Tim Goodman complimented the pilot's tonal diversity while expressing concern that American audiences would [...] "tune in, get <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> by the scattershot emotional chords and flip over to something safer." [...] However, he praised Cherry's writing {{as well as the}} acting, declaring, [...] "There are almost too many things to love in 'Desperate Housewives.'" [...] In his review of the episode, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commended the episode for its [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity, as it stretches from sharp satire to dishy soap opera to tragique tribute and back again." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, fashion designer and Angelina Jolie's Maleficent collaborator Stella McCartney said: [...] "My favorite Disney film was Snow White. I remember growing up watching [...] and being completely <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> by that scene where the evil queen becomes the old witch and she makes the poison apple." [...] Film maker and actor Terry Gilliam listed the film's Queen among his eight favourite villains, commenting how [...] "truly strange" [...] is that [...] "vanity and beauty are what she's all about, yet the identity she assumes when she becomes the old beggar woman is practically the ugliest in all the kingdom." [...] Fairy tale lecturer Jack Zipes alike noted that [...] "it is somewhat strange that the queen believes the mirror, for the picture of Snow White reveals {{that she is a}} pretty pubescent red-cheeked ordinary girl while the queen is a stunning beautiful mature woman who might easily win a beauty contest." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. Popjustice responded positively: [...] "It must be hard being Nicola Roberts. Imagine living your life knowing {{that at any}} point you might be CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF YOUR OWN AMAZINGNESS", noting that the band Dragonette was a large part behind {{the success of the}} track. Dan Lambden from the online magazine So So Gay found the song to be a [...] "perfect medium between classic pop lyrics" [...] and [...] "a pulsating dance beat", and positively commented on the riffs within the track stating they would [...] "satisfy the most Hoxton of hipsters". Emily Mackay from NME declared [...] "I'd be a bit <b>freaked</b> <b>out</b> by a phonecall like that" [...] in response to the lyrics [...] "I’d like a phone call/I’d like to hear something like this—WAHWAHWAHWAH". Mackay called the track [...] "classy" [...] and concluded her review saying [...] "the sugar-spun electropop goes down smooth." [...] Despite listing [...] "Lucky Day" [...] as one of the singles of the week, Alex Macpherson of Metro gave a predominantly negative review noting [...] "She’s lionised by a cult fan base, but wider appeal remains elusive" [...] and further explaining that [...] "her voice is simultaneously too weak and shrill to carry".|$|E
