5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 1, Union cavalry in the {{division}} of Brig. Gen. John Buford were awaiting the approach of Confederate infantry forces <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Cashtown, to the northwest. Confederate forces from the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew had briefly clashed with Union forces the day before but believed they were Pennsylvania militia of little consequence, not the regular army cavalry that was screening {{the approach of the}} Army of the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|The cruisers {{experienced}} differing {{levels of}} success. Newfoundland initially attacked coastal gun batteries, but these did not fire on her or her escorting destroyer. She also successfully bombarded the airfield on Eten Island. The attacks by Achilles and Uganda on a seaplane base on Dublon Island {{did not cause}} any damage and were marred by communications problems between the ships and their spotting Seafires. As Achilles sailed away from Truk, the cruiser's anti-aircraft gunners fired on two aircraft which approached her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the atoll until they were identified as British Avengers.|$|E

30|$|The {{principal}} {{angles of}} average strains {{were found to}} differ considerably <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> local displacements around the cracks, and this difference therefore needs to be well understood when the shear behavior or the local behavior around the cracks are simulated by an analysis model.|$|R
5000|$|To {{comply with}} <b>the</b> convention, <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{voltage and current}} {{variables}} used to calculate power and resistance in the component must have a certain relationship: the current variable must be defined so positive current enters the positive voltage terminal of the device. [...] These directions may be different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual current flow and voltage.|$|R
5|$|At 0530 {{elements}} of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division with tank support, launched a new assault to capture the village of Grainville-sur-Odon. After shelling and close quarter street fighting, the Scots secured the village by 1300 hours; German counter-attacks followed but were repulsed. At 0600 the Germans began two strong flanking attacks, {{with the intention of}} pinching out the British salient. Kampfgruppe Frey on the eastern flank, launched an attack north of the Odon, supported by Panzer IVs of the 21st Panzer Division. This reached the villages of Mouen and Tourville but the British counter-attacked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Cheux, resulting in confused heavy fighting throughout the day. Frey's battle group managed to gain control of Mouen and British counter-attacks supported by tanks halted any further advance but were unable to retake the village. British patrols found Marcelet partly empty, the German front line having been pulled back towards Carpiquet.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{ordered the}} 4th Cavalry Division, less the 19th Lancers (Fane's Horse), 12th Cavalry Brigade, {{to advance to}} Beisan; leaving Afulah at 13:00 on 20 September, led by the 10th Cavalry Brigade. They {{advanced}} quickly along the main road protected by flank guards; the 36th Jacob's Horse, 11th Cavalry Brigade, capturing some German soldiers along the way. About 100 enemy soldiers retreating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Mount Ephraim were captured during this advance, and while moving down the railway through Shatta into Beisan another 100 or more soldiers with three 150-mm howitzers facing eastwards were captured. A line of piquets was established from Afulah to Beisan and another 700 prisoners were captured during the night.|$|E
5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E

50|$|Crosshouse and {{its four}} {{platforms}} {{served as a}} junction station, allowing travel to Kilmarnock <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> both Irvine and Dalry. The Irvine service was withdrawn on 6 April 1964, with the station closing permanently to passengers on 18 April 1966, although the line was still in use by freight trains and diverted passenger trains until 23 October 1973.|$|R
50|$|Kościuszko {{was still}} in Kraków region, unable to leave because of the Denisov army. On May 5, he {{fortified}} himself at a camp near Połaniec, seeking rescue operations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> Warsaw and Lublin. Denisov attacked Połaniec, but threatened with encirclement withdrew on May 17 toward Silesia. Kościuszko was {{able to communicate with}} Warsaw and exert more influence on the events there.|$|R
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
5|$|Reshef {{decided to}} change tactics. He {{personally}} commanded the 40th Armored Battalions, after reinforcing it with tanks salvaged and repaired from the previous night's fighting, and maneuvered to attack from the west – <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the canal – hitting Egyptian positions in the flank, while a tank company and an infantry company attacked from south to north. Reshef's forces engaged the Egyptians from long range, picking off defensive positions from afar, while using alternate fire and movement {{to advance to the}} crossroads. The defending infantry battalion, exhausted by continuous fighting and suffering from a severe lack of ammunition, soon withdrew allowing the Israelis to at last seize the junction.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Army {{faced the}} Hungarian 3rd Army, {{and during the}} first few days after the {{commencement}} of the invasion, there were exchanges of fire with Hungarian border guards, but the 1st Army faced no direct attacks. Neither the 1st Army or the Hungarians were ready for full-scale fighting, as they were still mobilising and deploying their forces. On 9 April, due to events in other parts of Yugoslavia, the 6th Army on the right flank of the 1st Army was ordered to withdraw south of the Danube and deploy on a line facing east to defend against an attack <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Sofia, Bulgaria. 2nd Army Group also received orders to withdraw south of the line of the Drava and Danube. 1st Army began to withdraw, and on the same day elements were approaching the Danube crossing.|$|E
50|$|On 7 October 1874, a {{few months}} after Patriarch Ignatius Philip I Arkus death, George Shelhot was elected Patriarch. In order to point out his {{independence}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> centralization typical of Pope Pius IX, he decided to be enthroned on 11 October without waiting for the papal confirmation (that arrived shortly later on 21 December 1874). George Shelhot moved the patriarchal See to Aleppo.|$|R

5|$|The 2nd Army Group {{faced the}} Hungarian 3rd Army across the border, {{and during the}} first few days after the {{commencement}} of the invasion, there were exchanges of fire with Hungarian border guards, but the Yugoslavs faced no direct attacks along the 2nd Army Group sector. Neither the 2nd Army Group nor the Hungarians were ready for full-scale fighting, as they were still mobilising and deploying their forces. On 9 April, due to German successes elsewhere in Yugoslavia, the 6th Army on the right flank of the 2nd Army Group was ordered to withdraw south of the Danube and deploy on a line facing east to defend against an attack <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Sofia, Bulgaria. 2nd Army Group also received orders to withdraw south of the line of the Drava and Danube. 1st Army began to withdraw, and on the same day elements were approaching the Danube crossing. The headquarters of the 2nd Army issued orders to evacuate Baranja and reinforce the left flank.|$|E

5|$|The prison {{officers}} {{guarding the}} gates outside the chapel abandoned them, and ran towards the Centre. The prison {{officer in charge}} of the Centre saw his colleagues running <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the chapel, but due to the presence of scaffolding he was in a poor position to view the upper levels, and mistakenly assumed he saw prisoners running from the chapel. He informed other officers on C1 and D1 of this and, upon hearing that prisoners were in possession of keys, told them and officers on A1 that they should evacuate the prison. Governor Morrison, who was responsible for the main prison, was present and did not intervene with these instructions. Morrison then ordered officers to evacuate the Centre at 11:13 am as he mistakenly believed prisoners had entered the Centre. By this time prisoners had gained access to the roofs of E and F wings, and from there gained access to other wings by making holes in unprotected office ceilings.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} day of World War II, German troops invaded Upper Silesia <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> Gliwice. Władysław Kiełbasa was part of the [...] "Silesia" [...] {{operational}} group, which was in turn part of the Kraków Army. While leading a counterattack against German forces between the towns of Mikołów and Wyry, part of an operation to withdraw Polish units behind the Przemsza River, Kiełbasa was struck by shrapnel and killed.|$|R

5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> its pole, {{sections of the}} surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement {{that is in the}} direction of the observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|Vega is {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its {{expected}} lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> one of these poles.|$|E
5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the cyclone. In {{the mid to late}} 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E

5|$|East of Middletown, US40Alternate {{passes through}} a {{suburban}} area then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a climbing lane eastbound {{to the top of}} the mountain, which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US40Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane eastbound, two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At the base of the mountain, the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Frederick. East of I-70, US40Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from eastbound US40Alternate to westbound US40 or from eastbound US40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
25|$|After several clashes {{in which}} the NLA insurgents were defeated, on 29 May 2001, Macedonian police and army units entered the village of Matejce. While searching the houses, the police found weapons and {{military}} equipment. The police also discovered a system of underground tunnels which provided connection between several houses. After the Macedonian security forces captured Matejce, the NLA initiated a coordinated attack on <b>the</b> village <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> Otlja, Orizare and Slupcane. The insurgents were firing machine-guns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and rocket propelled grenades".|$|R

50|$|The {{location}} of Emona overlaps with the southwest {{part of the}} old nucleus of the modern city of Ljubljana. In a rectangle with a central square or forum and a system of rectangular intersecting streets, Emona was laid out as a typical Roman town. According to Roman custom, there were cemeteries along the northern, western, and eastern thoroughfares into <b>the</b> city - <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> Celeia, Aquileia, and Neviodunum. The wider area surrounding the town saw the development of typical Roman countryside: villages, hamlets, estates, and brickworks.|$|R
