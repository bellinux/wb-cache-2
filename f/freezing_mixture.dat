25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a <b>freezing</b> <b>mixture,</b> by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E

40|$|The {{porous polymer}} foams {{act as a}} {{template}} for neotissuegenesis in tissue engineering, and, as a reservoir for cell transplants such as pancreatic islets while simultaneously providing a functional interface with the host body. The fabrication of foams with the controlled shape, size and pore structure is of prime importance in various bioengineering applications. To this end, here we demonstrate a thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) based facile process for the fabrication of polymer foams with a controlled architecture. The setup comprises of a metallic template bar (T), a metallic conducting block (C) and a non-metallic reservoir tube (R), connected in sequence T-C-R. The process hereinafter termed as Dip TIPS, involves the dipping of the T-bar into a polymer solution, followed by filling of the R-tube with a <b>freezing</b> <b>mixture</b> to induce the phase separation of a polymer solution {{in the immediate vicinity}} of T-bar; Subsequent free-drying or freeze-extraction steps produced the polymer foams. An easy exchange of the T-bar of a spherical or rectangular shape allowed the fabrication of tubular, open- capsular and flat-sheet shaped foams. A mere change in the quenching time produced the foams with a thickness ranging from hundreds of microns to several millimeters. And, the pore size was conveniently controlled by varying either the polymer concentration or the quenching temperature. Subsequent in vivo studies in brown Norway rats for 4 -weeks demonstrated the guided cell infiltration and homogenous cell distribution through the polymer matrix, without any fibrous capsule and necrotic core. In conclusion, the results show the "Dip TIPS" as a facile and adaptable process for the fabrication of anisotropic channeled porous polymer foams of various shapes and sizes for potential applications in tissue engineering, cell transplantation and other related fields...|$|E

The PMNL (1 - 2 x 107 /ml) were stored in 2 -ml ampoules in the gas phase of liquid nitrogen at a temperature between- 160 °C and- 196 °C using dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO 10 %) as cryo-protectant.

Careful post-thaw handling of the cells was an important factor in preserving function. These preliminary studies indicate that useful numbers of PMNL can be recovered in a functional state after storage for long periods in liquid nitrogen. Attempts to preserve mature polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) for long periods at low tempera-tures have met with little success (Cavins et al., 1968; Crowley et al., 1974; Pegg, 1972). PMNL are more susceptible to cooling and freezing injury than other blood cells (Pegg, 1972), damage apparently resulting from thermal shock during cooling, osmotic changes during freezing and thawing, and intracellular ice formation (Knight et al., 1975). The widespread use of white cell transfusions in leukaemic patients during periods of marrow depression, however, has created a need for readily available PMNL and makes the development of 'cell banks ' a desirable aim. A recent report of PMNL storage at- 80 °C for up to three months has given hope that these cells might be cryopreserved in a viable state (Lionetti et al., 1975). We describe here our experi-ence with storing PMNL in the gas phase of liquid nitrogen at a temperature between- 160 °C and- 196 °C (in liquid nitrogen vapour at- 196 °C) with recovery of functional cells after cryopreserva-tion for up to 14 months.
