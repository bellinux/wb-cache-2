40|$|Individuals {{frequently}} have difficulty understanding how behavior can reduce genetically-conferred risk for {{diseases such as}} colon cancer. With increasing opportunities to purchase genetic tests, communication strategies are needed for presenting information in ways that optimize comprehension and adaptive behavior. Using the Common-Sense Model, we tested the efficacy of a strategy for providing information about the relationships (links) among the physiological processes underlying disease risk and protective action on understanding, protective action motivations, and willingness to purchase tests. We tested {{the generalizability of the}} strategy's effects across varying risk levels, for genetic tests versus tests of a nongenetic biomarker, and when using graphic and numeric risk formats. In an internet-based experiment, 749 adults from four countries responded to messages about a hypothetical test for colon cancer risk. Messages varied by Risk-Action Link Information (provision or no provision of information describing how a low-fat diet reduces risk given positive results, indicating presence of a gene fault), Risk <b>Increment</b> (<b>20</b> %, 50 %, or 80 % risk given positive results), Risk Format (numeric or graphic presentation of risk increments), and Tes t Type (genetic or enzyme). Providing risk-action link information enhanced beliefs of coherence (understanding how a low-fat diet reduces risk) and response efficacy (low-fat diets effectively reduce risk) and lowered appraisals of anticipated risk of colon cancer given positive results. These effects held across risk increments, risk formats, and test types. For genetic tests, provision of risk-action link information reduced the amount individuals were willing to pay for testing. Brief messages explaining how action can reduce genetic and biomarker-detected risks can promote beliefs motivating protective action. By enhancing understanding of behavioral control, they may reduce the perceived value of genetic risk information. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Waste {{printed circuit}} boards (WPCBs) are resource-rich but hazardous, {{demanding}} innovative strategies for post-consumer collection, recycling, and mining for economically precious constituents. A novel technology for disassembling electronic components from WPCBs is proposed, using hot air to melt solders and to separate the components and base boards. An automatic heated-air disassembling equipment was designed to operate at a heating source temperature at a maximum of 260 °C and an inlet pressure of 0. 5 MPa. A total of 13 individual WPCBs were subjected to disassembling tests at different preheat temperatures in <b>increments</b> of <b>20</b> °C between 80 and 160 °C, heating source temperatures ranging from 220 to 300 °C in <b>increments</b> of <b>20</b> °C, and incubation periods of 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 min. For each experimental treatment, the disassembly efficiency was calculated as the ratio of electronic components released from the board to {{the total number of}} its original components. The optimal preheat temperature, heating source temperature, and incubation period to disassemble intact components were 120 °C, 260 °C, and 2 min, respectively. The disassembly rate of small surface mount components (side length ≤ 3 mm) was 40 - 50 % lower than that of other surface mount components and pin through hole components. On the basis of these results, a reproducible and sustainable industrial ecological protocol using steam produced by industrial exhaust heat coupled to electronic-waste recycling is proposed, providing an efficient, promising, and green method for both electronic component recovery and industrial exhaust heat reutilization. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of {{the introduction of the}} black-tailed deer to the Queen Charlotte Islands (British Columbia, Canada), we used dendrochronological analyses to understand the consequences of deer browsing on Sitka spruce growth. We compared shape, radial growth, height growth and age of young spruce in three sites. We identified two types of trees growing side by side: (1) stunted and heavily browsed spruce, smaller than the browsing limit and (2) escaped spruce that were taller than the browsing limit but still browsed in their lower part. The compact and heavily ramified shape in stunted spruce was the result of repeated and intense browsing. In escaped spruce this was also the case below the browsing limit (1 : 16 m 0 : 07 m), in sharp contrast with the normal shape that escaped spruce resumed above the browsing limit. We show that the release of browsing pressure, once the tree reaches the browsing limit, is characterised by an abrupt increase in radial growth. Before release, trees show a growth stagnation characterized by narrow rings (0. 5 mm per year) and small annual height increments (< 5 cm per year). After release, trees show a growth stabilisation characterised by wider rings (3 mm per year) and larger annual height <b>increments</b> (<b>20</b> cm per year). We use this pattern to estimate frequency and age at release and their possible variation over time. Age differences between stunted and escaped spruce are highly significant and indicate that, despite of browsing, most if not all trees will ultimately reach the browsing limit and escape. Heavy deer pressure (30 deer per km 2) delays spruce sapling recruitment by about 8 years. This delay varies in relation to site quality and seems to have increased over time, suggesting an increase i...|$|R

Hierarchical mul-tiresolution triangulation and level-of-detail rendering algorithms over regular structures of grid digital elevation models have been widely used for interactive terrain visualization. The main drawbacks of these are the large cost of memory storage required and the possible over-sampling of highresolution terrain models. Triangulated irregular networks (TIN) can reduce the amount of vertices at the expense of more complex and slower memory data access. We present a hyper-block quadtree based triangulated irregular networks approach, where the notion of vertex-selection is extended to block-selection. The hyper-block structure allows to store different pre-calculated triangulations.
