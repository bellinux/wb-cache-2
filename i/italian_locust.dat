50|$|Calliptamus italicus, the <b>Italian</b> <b>locust,</b> is {{a species}} of 'short-horned grasshopper' {{belonging}} to the family Acrididae, subfamily Calliptaminae.|$|E
50|$|In certain {{circumstances}} this species may develop {{a tendency to}} gregariousness with formation of very numerous aggregates, potentially harmful to crops. It normally occurs in low densities in undisturbed sparse grassland but disappears when the land is cultivated. It occurs in high densities in uncultivated land that is invaded by Artemisia, and on overgrazed pastures with weeds and bare ground. Under these conditions it can become gregarious and form locust swarms. After {{the breakup of the}} USSR in 1991, much agricultural land was left uncultivated. This gave ideal conditions for the <b>Italian</b> <b>locust</b> to breed and build up in numbers, and Kazakhstan suffered a devastating locust plague between 1998 and 2001.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Italian</b> <b>Locust,</b> Calliptamus {{italicus}} (Linnaeus) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful species to the grasslands in Xinjiang province, China. It attacks a variety of plants in Compositae, Chenopodiaceae and Gramineae. We used CLIMEX and ArcGIS to determine the potential geographical distribution of C. italicus in China under current and future climatic scenarios. Our analysis predicted that under current climatic conditions, C. italicus has a wide potential distribution in areas north of the Yangtze River in China. With the climatic changes, the potential range for C. italicus was projected to expand, and the suitability levels of most areas would increase, especially in areas with optimal climatic conditions. We therefore suggest that surveys should be enhanced in the areas suitable for C. italicus to facilitate early detection and reduce potential damage...|$|E

40|$|The gut {{bacterial}} {{community from}} four species of feral locusts and grasshoppers {{was determined by}} {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene fragments. The study revealed an effect of phase polymorphism on gut bacterial diversity in brown locusts from South Africa. A single bacterial phylotype, consistent with Citrobacter sp. dominated the gut microbiota of two sympatric populations of Moroccan and <b>Italian</b> <b>locusts</b> in Spain. There was evidence for Wollbachia sp. in the meadow grasshopper caught locally in the UK. Sequence analysis of DGGE products did not reveal evidence for unculturable bacteria and homologies suggested that bacterial species were principally Gammapoteobacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae similar to those recorded previously in laboratory reared locusts.

40|$|Foraging opportunism {{and feeding}} {{frequency}} are less studied parameters of behaviour in insectivorous falcons, {{many of which}} are endangered bird species. In this short study, prey composition and feeding frequency of red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus) nestlings were studied using the method of camera recordings during seven days in July 2017 in southwestern Slovakia. Camera recording analyses of 2 – 3 chicks (14 – 26 days old) in three nests revealed a significant preference for insects (97 %, n = 305 prey items), of which the <b>Italian</b> <b>locust</b> (Calliptamus italicus) was highly predominant (54 %). We also found very high average chick feeding frequency (9. 9 feedings per hour, n = 29 hours 22 min of regular observations), whereby the females fed their young ones more frequently (64. 9 %, n = 305 feedings) than the males (35. 1 %). Analyses of food composition in adverse weather conditions showed that unfavourable weather had a negative effect on chick feeding frequency, and in rainy weather the males fed significantly less than the females...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAgricultural {{intensification}} {{in western}} Europe {{has caused a}} dramatic loss of grassland surfaces in farmlands, which have resulted in strong declines in grassland invertebrates, leading to cascade effects at higher trophic levels among consumers of invertebrates. Grasshoppers are important components of grassland invertebrate assemblages in European agricultural ecosystems, particularly as prey for bird species. Understanding how grasshopper populations are distributed in fragmented landscapes with low grassland availability is critical for both studies in biodiversity conservation and insect management. We assessed the range and strength of spatial autocorrelation for two grasshopper taxa (Gomphocerinae subfamily and Calliptamus italicus L.) across an intensive farmland in western France. Data from surveys carried out over 8 yr in 1, 715 grassland fields were analyzed using geostatistics. Weak spatial patterns were observed at small spatial scales, suggesting important local effects of management practices on grasshopper densities. Spatial autocorrelation patterns for both grasshopper taxa were only detected at intermediate scales. For Gomphocerinae, the range of spatial autocorrelation varied from 802 to 2, 613 m according to the year, depending both on grasshopper density and on grassland surfaces in the study site, whereas spatial patterns for the <b>Italian</b> <b>locust</b> were more variable and not related to grasshopper density or grassland surfaces. Spatial patterns {{in the distribution of}} Gomphocerinae supported our hypothesis that habitat availability was a major driver of grasshopper distribution in the landscape, and suggested it was related to density-dependent processes such as dispersal...|$|E
