40|$|This {{paper has}} three primary goals. First, we provide an {{overview}} on some foundational concepts – “peer-production,” “user-centric innovation,” “crowdsourcing,” “task granularity,” and yes, open source and open content – {{for they are}} key elements of Internet-based collaboration we see today. Second, through this discussion on foundational concepts, we hope {{to make it clear}} why people interested in collaborative public management and administration should care about open source and open source-like collaboration. After this argument is made, we provide a very condensed summary of where we are to date on open source collaboration research. The goal of that research is to learn about the factors that lead to successful or abandoned collaborations in the open source domain, in part to help us understand how “open source-like” collaborations can be deployed in areas outside of software. We have a lot to cover. Let’s <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>it...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In his {{critique}} of modern libertarian thinking, Jeffrey Friedman (1997) argues that libertarian moral theory makes social science irrelevant. However, ~fits moral claims are hypothetical rather than categorical impera-tives, then economics, history, sociology, and other disciplines {{play a central role}} in libertarian thought. Limitations on human knowledge necessitate abstractly formulated rules, among which are claims of rights. Further, Friedman’s re-marks onfreedom rest on an erroneous understanding of the role of definitions in philosophy, and his characterization of the “right to do wrong ” as a “logical contradiction ” reveals a misunderstanding of logic. There are many problems in Jefl 1 ~eyFriedman’s “What’s Wrong with Libertarianism ” (Critical Review ii, no. r), but one is so important to his entire critique that I wish to <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Friedman insists that there is an inconsistency between believing that individuals have rights, on the one hand, and evaluating policies on the grounds of their good or bad consequences generally (setting aside the trivial consequence that the policies may be compatible or incompatible with the asserted rights themselves). Friedman calls the attempt to get around this inconsistency “libertarian straddling,” which “tries to marry instrumentalist and intrinsic defenses of liber...|$|E

50|$|He says that, Unfortunately, {{many are}} led to {{believe this is the}} primary goal of public administration...the media and others have {{convinced}} the public that public administration should be able to function like business. Self-serving politicians preach this, too. They moralize that everything in government should be based on the consideration of economics and efficiency. All public administrators who enter upon public service take an ‘oath' affirming they will be faithful to the Constitution of the United States. If public administrators are to remain faithful to the Constitution then they need to defend the values, principles and ethics underpinning that document. When you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> down <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> I believe most people would agree fairness is the most important attribute for a public servant. However, the public are misguided by the market paradigm to believe efficiency and returns on investment be the guiding principles for a public servant.|$|R

5000|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike, holding a 6.5/10 {{score on the}} Internet Movie Database. Critics praised the film's special effects, but noted with some concern that the violence and frightful nature of the film directly clashed with its supposedly child-friendly tone. Andrew Pragasam noted that while [...] "there is plenty of humour and monster fun, the horrific elements are remarkably potent for a family film, with gory violence, chills and suspense." [...] Online film critic James Rolfe compared {{the conflict between the}} film's light-hearted humour and its violence and use of curses to [...] "watching Beauty and the Beast and one of the tea cups gouging out Belle's eye and telling her to go to hell." [...] Reviewer Chris Sims downplayed the violent aspects of the film, however, stating that [...] "as strange as the movie and its weird monsters might seem, when you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> down <b>to</b> <b>it</b> it’s no more bizarre than the fairy tales we’re all used to {{on this side of the}} Pacific, <b>right</b> down <b>to</b> our stories of cursed spinning wheels and hair-accessible towers, and really, the themes are just as universal." ...|$|R

But, though {{there are a number of}} talented actors in the cast, Eloise just isn't a compelling enough character to sustain an entire movie. There's no doubt that the movie will act as wish fulfillment for kids - who wouldn't want to run amuck and get away with it? - but when you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> down <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> Eloise is awfully thin and one-dimensional (not to mention annoying)."

They might cover it up with an arm in the air or two, a walk {{from one side of the}} stage to the other, a moody stare into the crowd, some bouncy high-fives, and a certain amount of joining in at the end of each line, but when you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> down <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> it's all just queueing.And to make matters worse, sometimes the queue is barged by a singer. Someone who isn't actually even IN Roll Deep. They've be brought in on chorus duties, taking precious rhyme time away from people who've been in the queue for ages, actually. It's not fair, just because they can provide some melodic light relief from all of that truth-spitting, that they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> stroll <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the front.

ALEC formally denied lobbying, although Delores Mertz, who had previously served as chairwoman of the ALEC board, said she was [...] "concerned about the lobbying that's going on, especially with ALEC's 501(c)3 status". Reporting on the allegations, Bloomberg Businessweek compared ALEC's work to that of lobbyists, noting, [...] "part of ALEC's mission is to present industry-backed legislation as grass-roots work," [...] and that being a nonprofit rather than a lobby group allows deductibility of membership dues and freedom from disclosing the names of legislators who attend its educational seminars or the executives who give presentations to those legislators. William Schluter, vice chairman of the New Jersey Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said of ALEC's activities, [...] "When you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> down <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> this is not different from lobbying. It is lobbying. ...Any kind of large organization that adds to public policy or has initiatives involving public policy should be disclosed—not only their name, but who is backing them."
