5|$|Solar {{heating systems}} are a well known second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a <b>fluid</b> <b>system</b> {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E

2500|$|The seeding {{particles}} are an inherently {{critical component of}} the PIV system. [...] Depending on the fluid under investigation, the particles {{must be able to}} match the fluid properties reasonably well. [...] Otherwise they will not follow the flow satisfactorily enough for the PIV analysis to be considered accurate. [...] Ideal particles will have the same density as the <b>fluid</b> <b>system</b> being used, and be spherical (these {{particles are}} called microspheres). [...] While the actual particle choice is dependent {{on the nature of the}} fluid, generally for macro PIV investigations they are glass beads, polystyrene, polyethylene, aluminum flakes or oil droplets (if the fluid under investigation is a gas). [...] Refractive index for the seeding particles should be different from the fluid which they are seeding, so that the laser sheet incident on the fluid flow will reflect off of the particles and be scattered towards the camera.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his career, Cruyff became {{synonymous with}} the playing style of [...] "Total Football". It is a system where a player who moves out of his {{position}} is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this <b>fluid</b> <b>system,</b> no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field [...] "conductor". Space {{and the creation of}} it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff, who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: [...] "We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We always talked about speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time? That is where we have to play the ball. Every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole." ...|$|E

40|$|Turbulence is a {{paradigm}} for far-from-equilibrium systems without time reversal symmetry. To capture the nonequilibrium irreversible nature of turbulence and investigate its implications, we develop a potential landscape and flux field theory for turbulent flow and more general nonequilibrium <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> governed by stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. We find that equilibrium <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> with time reversibility {{are characterized by}} a detailed balance constraint that quantifies the detailed balance condition. In nonequilibrium <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> with nonequilibrium steady states, detailed balance breaking leads directly {{to a pair of}} interconnected consequences, namely, the non-Gaussian potential landscape and the irreversible probability flux, forming a 'nonequilibrium trinity'. The nonequilibrium trinity characterizes the nonequilibrium irreversible essence of <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> with intrinsic time irreversibility and is manifested in various aspects of these systems. The nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> including turbulence with detailed balance breaking is shown to be driven by both the non-Gaussian potential landscape gradient and the irreversible probability flux, together with the reversible convective force and the stochastic stirring force. We reveal an underlying connection of the energy flux essential for turbulence energy cascade to the irreversible probability flux and the non-Gaussian potential landscape generated by detailed balance breaking. Using the energy flux as a center of connection, we demonstrate that the four-fifths law in fully developed turbulence is a consequence and reflection of the nonequilibrium trinity. We also show how the nonequilibrium trinity can affect the scaling laws in turbulence. Comment: (c) 2017. This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL]...|$|R

50|$|The {{water supply}} system or a {{wastewater}} system in a house or other building may have a leak in any of numerous locations, causing dripping out or spillage of the water. Gas leaks, e.g. in natural gas lines allow flammable and potentially explosive gas to leak out, resulting in a hazardous situation. Leaks of refrigerant may occur in refrigerators or air conditioning systems, large and small. Some industrial plants, especially chemical and power plants, have numerous <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> containing many types of liquid or gas chemicals, sometimes at high temperature and/or pressure. An example of a possible industrial location of a leak between two <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> includes a leak between the shell and tube sides in a heat exchanger, potentially contaminating either or both <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> with the other <b>fluid.</b> A <b>system</b> holding a full or partial vacuum may have a leak causing inleakage of air from the outside. Hazmat procedures and/or teams may become involved when leakage or spillage of hazardous materials occurs. Leaks while transporting hazardous materials could result in danger; for example, when accidents occur. However, even leakage of steam can be dangerous {{because of the high}} temperature and energy of the steam.|$|R
