5|$|In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, began hearing several testimonies {{from people}} who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The {{following}} year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and {{told him about the}} people he had met who had become Christians as a result of Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.|$|E
5|$|Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal {{searched for}} Wallenberg and {{collected}} several testimonies.

Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. An eyewitness asserted that she had seen Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January 1587, Perkins preached {{a sermon}} denouncing the {{practice}} of kneeling to receive Communion, and was ultimately called before the Vice-Chancellor as a result. During the final set of trials against Puritan ministers in 1590–91, Perkins confirmed that he had discussed the Book of Discipline with Puritan ministers, but claimed {{that he could not}} remember whom he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to.</b> Perkins married Timothye Cradocke of Grantchester on 2 July 1595. (He had previously resigned his fellowship at Christ's College, since only unmarried men could be fellows.) Eventually, the couple would have seven children, three of whom would die from various causes, and one being born after Perkins's death.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 1972, George McGovern won the Massachusetts {{primary and}} Novak phoned Democratic {{politicians}} around the country, who agreed with his assessment that traditional blue collar Democrat voters {{were unaware of}} McGovern’s true beliefs. On April 27, 1972, Novak reported in a column that an unnamed Democratic senator <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him about McGovern. “The people don’t know McGovern is for amnesty, abortion, and legalization of pot,” the senator said. “Once middle America—Catholic middle America, in particular—finds this out, he’s dead.” The label stuck and McGovern {{became known as the}} candidate of “amnesty, abortion, and acid,” leading to his defeat that November in a 49 state landslide loss.|$|E

Both artists would use the label to release new music and sign other artists. On October 1, 2013, Game announced he was officially leaving Interscope Records, {{and that he was}} now a free agent. The following day he told Artistdirect that him signing to Cash Money Records was likely, and that a final announcement of a signing would probably come in January 2014. He also stated he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Kendrick Lamar, Nipsey Hussle, and Snoop Dogg about possibly doing collaboration albums in the future.|$|E

25|$|On June 20, Simpson was arraigned {{and pleaded}} not guilty to both murders. As expected, the {{presiding}} judge ordered that Simpson be held without bail. The following day, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict him for the two murders. Two days later on June 23, the grand jury was dismissed as a result of excessive media coverage, which could have influenced its neutrality. Jill Shively, a Brentwood resident who testified that she saw Simpson speeding away from the area of Nicole's house {{on the night of the}} murders, told the grand jury that the Bronco almost collided with a Nissan at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente Boulevard. Another grand jury witness, Jose Camacho, was a knife salesman at Ross Cutlery. He said he had sold Simpson a 15-inch (380mm) German-made knife, similar to the murder weapon, three weeks before the killings. Shively and Camacho were not presented by the prosecution at the criminal trial because they had sold their stories to the tabloid press. Shively <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the television show Hard Copy for $5,000, and Camacho sold his story to the National Enquirer for $12,500.|$|E
25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, said it <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> two sources from the raided village, {{who said that}} the raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what we do know is that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E

500|$|McQueen had {{recently}} worked with director Sam Peckinpah on Junior Bonner (1972), {{and enjoyed the}} experience, but the film proved to be unsuccessful. He said: [...] "Out of all my movies, Junior Bonner did not make one cent. In fact, it lost money." [...] McQueen recommended that Foster approach Peckinpah. Like McQueen, Peckinpah {{was in need of}} a box office hit and accepted immediately. The filmmaker had read the novel when it was originally published, and <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Thompson about making a film adaptation when he was starting out as a director.|$|E
500|$|Campbell died {{suddenly}} in July 1971, but [...] {{there was enough}} material in Analogs inventory to allow the remaining staff to put together issues {{for the rest of}} the year. [...] Condé Nast had given the magazine very little attention, since it was both profitable and cheap to produce, but they were proud that it was the leading science-fiction magazine. [...] They asked Kay Tarrant, who had been Campbell's assistant, to help them find a replacement: she contacted regular contributors to ask for suggestions. [...] Several well-known writers turned down the job; Poul Anderson did not want to leave California, and neither did Jerry Pournelle, who also felt the salary was too small. [...] Before he died, Campbell <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Harry Harrison about taking over as editor, but Harrison did not want to live in New York. Lester del Rey and Clifford D. Simak were also rumored to have been offered the job, though Simak denied it; Frederik Pohl was interested, but suspected his desire to change the direction of the magazine lessened his chances with Condé Nast. [...] The Condé Nast vice president in charge of selecting the new editor decided to read both fiction and nonfiction writing samples from the applicants, since Analogs title included both [...] "science fiction" [...] and [...] "science fact". He chose Ben Bova, afterwards telling Bova that his stories and articles [...] "were the only ones I could understand". [...] January 1972 was the first issue to credit Bova on the masthead.|$|E
