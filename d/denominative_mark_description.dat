Besides these, many had their faces painted, and wore their shirts over the rest of their dress; while coloured pasteboard and ribbons furnished out decorations for others. Those who wanted all these properties, blacked their faces, and turned their jackets inside out; and thus the transmutation of the whole assembly into a set of mad grotesque mummers, was at once completed.|$|R

40|$|Community {{trade mark}} and its {{relation}} to a national trade mark (RESUMÉ) The purpose of my thesis is to describe and analyse the system of the protection of trade marks in the European Union in comparison with the protection granted to trade marks in member states, mainly in the Czech Republic. The thesis is divided into five chapters. Each chapter deals with different aspect of trade mark protection. The introduction of the thesis outlines main parts of the system of intellectual property rights and focuses on the trade mark and its importance in the European Union. Chapter One deals with possibilities of protection of the trade mark in the European Union. This chapter further specifies national trade mark system and its legal regulation in the European Union and in the Czech Republic and international trade mark system called Madrid system. Chapter Two describes grounds for establishment and existence of the Community trade <b>mark.</b> <b>Description</b> of legal regulation and sources, characteristic features and types of the Community trade mark is the subject of further parts of this chapter.
