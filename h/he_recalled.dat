5|$|Compton Mackenzie, an English born Scottish novelist, {{acquired}} the tenancy. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> that his three years there had numerous logistical problems. It {{has been suggested}} that Mackenzie was the basis for the character Mr Cathcart in D.H.

At one point Mackenzie threatened to sue. However, Mackenzie did love islands and would graduate from Herm to the Hebrides.|$|E

[...] <b>He</b> <b>recalls</b> that his reaction then and in 1985 is that, [...] "by magic ink-sign crypto-telepathy, words in the right sequence can transmit between remote minds the mind's motion pictures." ...|$|R

5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly {{regarded as one}} of his most significant works, Station to Station was the vehicle for his performance persona, the Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> almost nothing of the production.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05.

40|$|Mr. Chavez {{recalls that}} in 1943 {{he tried to}} go as a bracero but was {{rejected}} because of his age; once he turned eighteen he was contracted along with his two older brothers; <b>he</b> <b>recalls</b> it taking two days to sign his contract, consequently they slept on the floor near the train; <b>he</b> <b>recalls</b> the health check by Mexican doctors, having their hands inspected, and being disinfected for lice; <b>he</b> <b>recalls</b> working in El Paso, making. 40 cents a pound, and driving large machinery; he remembers fifty men sleeping in a barrack, using the river to bathe, and not having a bathroom; he explains {{that he and his}} brothers rotated cooking and would spend a total of four dollars a week on groceries; <b>he</b> <b>recalls</b> illegals would work alongside them and were paid the same amount; he points out that immigration agents were not brutal but respectful; he explains how he brought his family to the United States and became an American citizen; he explains how he worked in the train tracks near Texas Western College, and hearing the explosions from the mines...|$|R

5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age.

In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In 535, Bessas was {{appointed}} {{as one of}} Belisarius' lieutenants (along with Constantine and Peranius) in the expedition against the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy. He accompanied Belisarius {{in the early stages}} of the campaign, from the recovery of Sicily to the siege of Naples, and was present at the latter's fall in November 536. From there the Byzantine army advanced on Rome, which it captured without a fight. Belisarius sent Constantine and Bessas to capture various outlying towns, but when he learned that the new Gothic king, Witiges, was marching on Rome, <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> them. Bessas tarried for a while near the town of Narni, which controlled the direct route from the Gothic capital, Ravenna, over the Apennines to Rome, and there met and defeated the Gothic vanguard in a skirmish.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E

5|$|In a later {{edition of}} his memoirs, Vrba responded that he is certain the {{reference}} to the imminent Hungarian deportations was in the original Slovak version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by hand, but which did not survive. He wrote that <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak Jewish Council, who translated the report into German, arguing that only actual deaths should be recorded, and not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. Vrba speculated {{that this was the}} reason Krasniansky omitted the references to Hungary from the German translation, which was the version that was copied around the world.|$|E
5|$|Independently of Schmid's actions, another {{figure has}} also been {{credited}} with ensuring Gisela took place. Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who was to the end the war as the most successful night fighter ace on 121 aerial victories—was said to have attempted to gain support for a like-minded offensive. Schnaufer pursued RAF bombers regularly to the English coast, or least {{the other side of}} the frontline. He experienced a lack of British interference beyond German-held territory. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> that he could fly around as if it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E
5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
