5|$|As {{technical}} director of Digital's Corporate Strategy Group, Kotok {{was instrumental in}} creating the Internet Business Group which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web-based technologies. Digital created the AltaVista search engine, the Internet firewall, the Web portal, the webcast and live election returns. Digital continued its lead in <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer. For example, he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent, the micropayment system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent.|$|E

A smart television, {{sometimes referred to}} as connected TV or hybrid television, is a television set with integrated <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> 2.0 features, and is an example of technological convergence between computers and television sets and set-top boxes. [...] Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{software}} development environments for discrete-event simulation have adopted either a language-based or a library-based approach. Although these approaches have advantages, they {{suffer from the}} following three major limitations. First, lack of portability. Simulation models developed using one simulation language or library might not be easily ported to another. Secondly, lack of interoperability. Components of a simulation application cannot be written in different programming languages, or running over different operating systems or hardware platforms. Third, lack of capability to execute over the <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Web.</b> Simulation models either perform sequential execution on a single workstation or run on parallel computers or LAN-connected workstations, which cannot scale over the <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Web</b> infrastructures.
