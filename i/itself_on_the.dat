5|$|According to Tough, an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might want}} to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them.

5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{sea floor}} {{and waits for}} approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the Empire of Brazil was the richest and most {{powerful}} nation in Latin America. It thrived under democratic institutions and a constitutional monarchy, and prided <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> absence of the caudillos, dictators and coups d'état which were common across the rest of the continent. During the minority of emperor PedroII in the 1830s, however, there had been internal rebellions driven by local disputes for power within a few provinces. One of these, the Ragamuffin War, had been led by Gonçalves, as noted above.|$|E

The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these had been designed as replacements {{for many of the}} older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.|$|E

5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs.

5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> characters– especially young Rastignac, {{who grew up in}} the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{picture of}} Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink of invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.|$|E

5|$|We {{believe that}} it is the {{inalienable}} right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
5|$|In September 1991, the {{government}} changed the {{policy for the}} military's procurement of air transport from 1 April 1992. This involved that the transport of 200,000 people annually would be transferred to scheduled services, resulting in Norway Airlines losing the opportunity to extend its engagement with the military. The route from Oslo to London was introduced on 3 October, at first with four weekly services, increasing to nine from 23 October. The three partner airlines launched their alliance as the TransNordic Group and would use a bowler hat as their common symbol. However, the routes arrived so {{late in the evening}} that the last flights from Fornebu to Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger and Tromsø had all departed. After five months the airline had achieved a 55-percent cabin factor on the London route. The ministry rejected in December 1991 the airline's application for flying to Stockholm and Copenhagen. By December the British airline Dan-Air had also established <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oslo–London route. To meet the price competition, SAS launched discounted business class tickets. In the course of twelve months from late 1991 to late 1992, the capacity between Oslo and London doubled, as also Norsk Air introduced a service from Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|In StarCraft, the Zerg are {{obsessed with}} the pursuit of genetic purity, and {{are the focus of}} the game's second episode. With the Xel'Nagaempowered Protoss {{targeted}} as the ultimate lifeform, the Zerg invade the Terran colonies in the Koprulu Sector to assimilate the Terrans' psionic potential and give the Zerg an edge over the Protoss. Through the actions of the Sons of Korhal, the Zerg are lured to the Confederate capital Tarsonis, where they capture the psionic ghost agent Sarah Kerrigan and infest her. Returning to the Zerg base of operations on Char, the Zerg are attacked by the dark templar Zeratul, who accidentally gives the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg Overmind. With victory in sight, the Overmind launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet.

5|$|In the south, Jordanian {{artillery}} shelling {{prevented the}} Israelis from erecting another pontoon bridge {{on the site}} of the Abdullah bridge, halting the Israeli advance there. After crossing the Allenby Bridge, the 7th Armored Brigade spread in three directions from Shuna: One or more companies drove north to Karameh. An infantry battalion and a tank battalion moved east to block the Salt road. And another infantry battalion moved south to assist the force trying to break across the Abdullah Bridge. Meanwhile, the force that crossed the Damia Bridge established <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east bank. Engineers began constructing a new bridge, and the force advanced east to the Musri junction. After taking Musri, their intended advance south to Karameh was repulsed by the northern brigade of the Jordanian 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{attained}} {{their greatest}} diversity during the Miocene, such as with baleen whales with over 20 recognized genera {{in comparison to}} only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a super-predator such as megalodon. However, {{by the end of}} the Miocene, many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, tropical whales decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages, and it is possible that it was quite dependent on them as a food source. Additionally, a marine megafauna extinction during the Pliocene was discovered to have eliminated 36% of all large marine species including 55% of marine mammals, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of sea turtles, likely aiding in its extinction; megalodon may have been too large to sustain <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> declining tropical food supply. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of megalodon to the polar regions, depriving it of its food source of large whales which had migrated there.|$|E
5|$|Neither the mutiny nor {{the popular}} {{uprising}} came entirely {{as a surprise}} to the French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. The crackdown also had the effect of increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDĐ. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the Sûreté to have a meaningful chance of success. At the most optimistic, they could hope to trigger a spontaneous uprising; at the worst, the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.|$|E
