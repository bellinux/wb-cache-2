5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
5|$|Early on April15, Sudal passed {{very near}} the {{uninhabited}} Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{circulation}} was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection, {{although it was}} able to intensify into Tropical Storm Pongsona at 1200UTC on December 3 while located 375km (230mi) northeast of Pohnpei. It turned to the west on December4, due to a ridge to the north. It slowly intensified, developing an eye feature on December5. That day, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon about 1150km (715mi) southeast of Guam.|$|E

5|$|On January2, {{an area of}} {{convection}} {{persisted in}} the eastern portion of the ITCZ in the Australian basin, located northwest of Cocos Island, or about 1165km (625mi) southwest of Sumatra. With a ridge to the south, the system moved generally westward. A nearby ship confirmed that a circulation formed, and on January3, it crossed 90°E into the south-west Indian Ocean as a tropical disturbance. With easterly wind shear, the system initially remained weak, but convection increased and organized on January5. On the next day, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression, although the circulation was still <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the thunderstorms at that time. After turning to the southwest, wind shear decreased, and the depression became Moderate Tropical Storm Bindu on January7. On the same day, the JTWC also initiated advisories as Tropical Cyclone 05S. Moving around the ridge to the south, Bindu slowly intensified, developing outflow and improved rainbands. Early on January9, the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status as an eye 19km (12mi) in diameter formed. The next day, Bindu weakened due to increased wind shear, causing the circulation to be <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection and for the cyclone to be downgraded into a severe tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} disturbance on August26, noting that {{an area of}} convection had an associated circulation. With favorable conditions, the agency assessed a fair potential for development. On August27, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as tropical depression south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima, although the circulation was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection. The next day, the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 22W about 945km (565mi) northeast of Saipan, after the thunderstorms began wrapping into the center.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E

5|$|A system {{developed}} {{within a}} convergence zone on January20 near {{the boundary between}} the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it turned toward the south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E
5|$|According to the JTWC, {{the storm}} quickly reached 1-minute {{sustained}} winds of 85km/h (50mph). The secondary disturbance {{to the west}} weakened while approaching the storm. Manou also weakened due to ongoing shear, and the windspeeds dropped as the circulation became <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection. On May6, the storm re-intensified and the thunderstorms redeveloped while passing north of Mauritius and Réunion. On May8 while approaching Madagascar, Manou developed an eye, and as a result, MFR upgraded it to tropical cyclone status, with 10-minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The JTWC also upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Manou intensified further, although its forward motion slowed significantly. MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 155km/h (95mph) on May8, and JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), with gusts to 165km/h (105mph). This made Manou a rare May tropical cyclone in the basin; only four other storms that formed in the south-west Indian Ocean in May reached winds of over 140km/h (85mph) since satellite coverage began, most recently Cyclone Kesiny in the previous year.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified into a deep depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{just north}} of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the {{waterway}} between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This {{marked the first time}} on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00UTC on November9, the center was beginning to become <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00UTC on November9, Megh weakened further into a severe cyclonic storm, and degraded further to a cyclonic storm by six hours later. While just offshore Yemen, the circulation slowed and turned to the northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00UTC on November10 the storm weakened to a deep depression, and three hours later Megh made landfall in southwestern Yemen northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55km/h (35mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00UTC on November10.|$|E
5|$|By January22, Charly {{developed}} a 37km (23mi) wide eye, surrounded by deep convection. Based on the increased organization, the storm became an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph), {{according to the}} MFR. In contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 195km/h (120mph). Late on January22, the wind shear and dry air increased while waters became cooler, all of which became detrimental to the storm's structure. The eye rapidly dissipated as the convection dwindled, and within 24hours of peak intensity, Charly was downgraded to tropical storm status. On January24, the storm passed about 320km (200mi) southeast of Rodrigues. By that time, the circulation was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the thunderstorms, and Charly weakened to tropical depression status on January25. Caught in the weak low-level flow, the circulation moved erratically, first to the west, then drifting before turning to the southeast. It continued to produce some convection during this time, which spread rainfall over Mauritius and Réunion. A cold front swept Charly to the southeast, absorbing it on January31.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> {{the area of}} convection, which was also deteriorating. After meandering, the storm began to move westward. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as high pressure {{to the south of}} Bermuda was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the Azores. By 1800UTC on August14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August18.|$|E

5|$|Continuing to the west-southwest upon {{entering}} the basin, Evrina gradually weakened as the eye gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects. On April8, the circulation turned to the east, dissipating two days later {{to the south of}} Rodrigues.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Jokwe {{remained}} {{over land}} for about 18hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel, weakening quickly to tropical storm status. Upon reaching open waters, convection {{increased over the}} center, and late on March 9 Jokwe re-intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery. The cyclone turned to the south-southeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its east. An upper-level low to its south produced good outflow which, in combination with warm waters, allowed Jokwe to re-intensify. Late on March 10, the storm passed about 35km (21mi) east of Europa Island, and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe to intense tropical cyclone status with winds of 170km/h (105mph). Subsequently, an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening trend, and by March 12 Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the deep convection; at the same time, the storm turned to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Developing rainbands and {{a central}} dense overcast, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Kesiny early on May4. Gradual intensification continued, although initially the convection remained dislocated {{to the west}} of the center. The circulation later moved beneath the thunderstorms, and a strengthening ridge turned Kesiny toward the west-southwest. Late on May5, a ragged eye began forming within the convection, which was indicative of a strengthening storm. That day, MFR upgraded Kesiny to a severe tropical storm. Early on May6, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, with maximum 1 minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). Around that time the outflow became pronounced to the north and south, although a decrease in outflow caused Kesiny to weaken. By May7, the circulation was <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection, and little re-intensification was expected. By that time, the storm was located about 650km (400mi) east of the northern tip of Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Erika {{continued}} to the west-northwest, {{and in the}} early hours of September 4, an eye-like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the convection. Despite unfavorable wind shear, Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530miles (850km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. Deep convection re-developed near the center, and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west-northwestward. Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85miles (135km) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane. An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125mph (205km/h) on September 8, while located about 350miles (565km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24hours before weakening over cooler waters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Neki was {{the final}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on October18 as an unusually large disturbance from a trough south of Hawaii. Moving northwestward, it slowly organized at first due to its large size. After reaching hurricane status on October21, Neki intensified at a much faster rate and peaked with winds of 125mph (205km/h). It later turned {{to the north and}} north-northeast and weakened due to hostile conditions. While passing through the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> the deepest convection. It caused little impact in the island chain. After stalling and executing a small loop, Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October27.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} was disorganized as it continued west; on November18 the center became <b>exposed</b> <b>from</b> {{the area of}} deep convection. However, the upper-level environment gradually became more favorable for further development, and deep convection, or thunderstorm activity, developed closer to the center. An eastward-moving upper-level trough in the Gulf of Mexico turned {{the depression}} northwest. The next day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm while a short distance north of Honduras, receiving the name Keith. It quickly intensified, and on November21 the storm reached its peak strength of 985mbar (29.09inHg) with winds of 70mph (110km/h). The trough, which turned Keith northwestward, rapidly accelerated northeastward; as a result, the storm moved slowly northwest until making landfall on the northeast tip of the Yucatán Peninsula at 0800UTC on November21, at an intensity slightly below hurricane status.|$|E
