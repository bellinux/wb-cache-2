The media have multiple layers in both the vertical and horizontal direction and can be fully anisotropic. The developed finite-difference method uses a staggered grid to approximate a vector equation {{in terms of the}} scattered electric field. The resultant linear sparse matrix is solved iteratively using a generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm and an incomplete LU precondition technique is applied to improve the convergence behavior of the linear equation, thus accelerate the solution.

One of the applications of such a program is in <b>electrical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging,</b> where oil exploration tools operate in a borehole drilled into the ground for geophysical subsurface sensing. The borehole with the invasion zone around it can be modeled as a multicylindrically layered geometry. The sensing tool, {{which is in the}} borehole, may not be exactly at the center, even though the center position has traditionally been thought to be the best place to operate the tool. An algorithm to study the effect of this eccentricity is considered. It uses a system of 2 multiplied by 2 reflection and transmission matrices to determine, in each homogeneous region, the ratio of standing waves to outgoing waves. Given this ratio (also a 2 multiplied by 2 matrix) in the center region, an infinite system of equations relates the geometry of the tool to that of the borehole.

40|$|In this paper, a {{methodology}} is suggested for deriving hydraulic parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity combining classical hydrogeological data with geophysical measurements. Estimates values of transmissivity and conductivity, with this approach, can reduce uncertainties in numerical model calibration and improve data coverage, reducing time {{and cost of}} a hydrogeological investigation at a regional scale. The conventional estimation of hydrogeological parameters {{needs to be done}} by analyzing wells data or laboratory measurements. Furthermore, to make a regional survey many wells should be considered, and the location of each one {{plays an important role in}} the interpretation stage. For this reason, the use of geoelectrical methods arises as an effective complementary technique, especially in developing countries where it is necessary to optimize resources. By combining hydraulic parameters from pumping tests and <b>electrical</b> resistivity from <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> profiles, it was possible to adjust three empirical laws in a semi-confined alluvial aquifer in the northeast of the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina).

40|$|The <b>electrical</b> <b>well</b> <b>logging</b> {{method has}} been applied for {{continuously}} measuring the earth resistivity. Both the current and the potential electrodes have been installed in an observation bore hole drilled {{very close to the}} Yamasaki fault in Hyogo prefecture. Electric currents of a rectangular wave form of an amplitude of 10 mA with a period of 10 second are being applied between the current electrodes and the apparent resistivity is computed from the potential difference measured between the adjacent potential electrodes. It was found that the apparent resistivity had increased about 10 % between March and September, 1980. After that it gradually decreased. Superposed on this gradual change are small fluctuations closely related to changes in the water level in the bore hore. An examination of these short period fluctuations indicates that the apparent resistivity increases about 0. 7 % for a one meter rise in water level with a time lag of 8 hours. On the other hand, the gradual increase of 10 % in the resistivity observed between March and September {{is supposed to be a}} part of the seasonal variations. It was found that this change could be well correlated to the seasonal change in strain observed by an extensometer installed in the direction of N 56 °E in a tunnel across the Yamasaki fault about 10 m from the bore hole. Although the bore hole used for this experiment is only 20 m deep, the present technique will be applicable in deeper wells to measure the resistivity of the deeper crust...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 101 - 106). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This research presents two approaches for working with reservoir properties. The first is the application of decision tree classifiers for predicting partitioning or classifications based on <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> for improving the permeability estimations. The second approach is the application of Markov Random Field (MRF) for determination of a 3 D high-resolution model of porosity using <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> and seismic attributes. The prediction of permeability is a critical aspect of reservoir characterization in complex reservoirs such as carbonate reservoirs. In order to improve the permeability estimation in these reservoirs, several techniques have been proposed to partition <b>well</b> <b>log</b> response into different classes, viz., layering or zoning, electrofacies and hydraulic flow units. It has been shown that the partition approaches are quite promising. However, they are generally defined using a specific set of <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> For this reason, difficulties arise in the estimation of permeability when there are missing <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In this research we developed an approach, using the decision tree classifiers, for solving the problem of missing <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> We predicted the partitions and estimated the impact of missing <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> at two complex carbonate reservoirs in west Texas, viz., Salt Creek Field Unit (SCFU) and North Robertson Unit (NRU). Porosity is another important reservoir property that is obtained from different sources in an oil field; the most common source being <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In some reservoirs porosity data from <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> is available only for few wells. Reservoir porosity models built using sparse well information can be highly uncertain. Therefore, we need to integrate information from different scales or sources to get an accurate spatial distribution for porosity. A common source of such additional information is seismic data. There are several techniques available for integrating seismic and <b>well</b> <b>log</b> data e. g., cokriging and its variants. These techniques are reasonably accurate but only when there are enough wells for determining the semivariogram from <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In this research, the concept of Markov Random Field (MRF) was used {{to solve the problem of}} reservoir not having enough wells for applying conventional geostatistical techniques of integration.
