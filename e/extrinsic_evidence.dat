Sotomayor stated that [...] "under the Court's new rule, {{it would not}} matter whether the State {{intended}} to use midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and quartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availability of sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, the State could execute them using whatever means it designate." [...] Sotomayor attacked the credence the Court gave to Oklahoma's expert witness, writing [...] "Dr. Evans' conclusions were entirely unsupported by any study or third-party source, contradicted by the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>evidence</b> proffered by petitioners, inconsistent with the scientific understanding of midazolam's properties, and apparently premised on basic logical errors." [...] Sotomayor contended Dr. Evans' testimony that midazolam could [...] "paralyze the brain" [...] was directly refuted by peer-reviewed articles cited by the prisoners' expert witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Plato's Problem is {{the term}} given by Noam Chomsky to [...] "the problem of {{explaining}} how we can know so much" [...] given our limited experience. Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by <b>extrinsic</b> <b>evidence</b> presented to a person during human development. In linguistics this {{is referred to as}} the [...] "argument from poverty of the stimulus" [...] (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always [...] "underdetermined by evidence". Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors. Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.|$|E

To begin, then; the {{supposed}} connection, or repugnance, {{between the two}} facts, may either be a conclusion from evidence (that is, from some other proposition or propositions), or may be admitted without any such ground; admitted, as the phrase is, on its own evidence; embraced as self-evident, as an axiomatic truth.

In the latter division must be included not only all cases in which a proposition is believed and held for true, literally without any <b>extrinsic</b> <b>evidence,</b> either of specific experience or general reasoning; but those more frequent cases in which simple inspection creates a presumption in favor of a proposition; not sufficient for belief, but sufficient to cause the strict principles of a regular induction to be dispensed with, and creating a predisposition to believe it on evidence which would be seen to be insufficient if no such presumption existed.

60|$|The controversies {{to which}} these speculations have given rise, and the doctrines which have been {{developed}} {{in the attempt to}} find a conclusive answer to them, have been fruitful of important consequences to the Science of Mind. The sensations (it was answered) which we are conscious of, and which we receive, not at random, but joined together in a certain uniform manner, imply not only a law or laws of connection, but a cause external to our mind, which cause, by its own laws, determines the laws according to which the sensations are connected and experienced. The schoolmen used to call this external cause by the name we have already employed, a substratum; and its attributes (as they expressed themselves) inhered, literally stuck, in it. To this substratum the name Matter is usually given in philosophical discussions. It was soon, however, acknowledged by all who reflected on the subject, that the existence of matter can not be proved by <b>extrinsic</b> <b>evidence.</b> The answer, therefore, now usually made to Berkeley and his followers, is, that the belief is intuitive; that mankind, in all ages, have felt themselves compelled, by a necessity of their nature, to refer their sensations to an external cause: that even those who deny it in theory, yield to the necessity in practice, and both in speech, thought, and feeling, do, equally with the vulgar, acknowledge their sensations to be the effects of something external to them: this knowledge, therefore, it is affirmed, is as evidently intuitive as our knowledge of our sensations themselves is intuitive. And here the question merges in the fundamental problem of metaphysics properly so called: to which science we leave it.|$|E

40|$|Interneurons are an {{integral}} part of cortical neuronal circuits. During the past decade, numerous studies have shown that these cells, unlike their pyramidal counterparts that are derived from the neuroepithelium along the lumen of the lateral ventricles, are generated in the ganglionic eminences in the subpallium. They use tangential migratory paths to reach the cortex, guided by intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> cues. <b>Evidence</b> is now emerging which suggests that the family of Slit proteins, acting through Robo receptors, play a role not only in axon guidance in the developing forebrain, but also as guiding signals in the migration of cortical interneurons. Here we describe the patterns of expression of Slit and Robo at different stages of forebrain development and review the evidence in support of their role in cortical interneuron migration. Slit–Robo signal transduction mechanisms are also important during normal development in a number of systems in the body and in disease states, making them potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurological disorders and certain types of cancer...|$|R

40|$|We {{prove that}} finding a Nash {{equilibrium}} {{of a game}} is hard, assuming the existence of indistinguisha-bility obfuscation and injective one-way functions with sub-exponential hardness. We do so by showing how these cryptographic primitives {{give rise to a}} hard computational problem that lies in the complexity class PPAD, for which finding Nash equilibrium is known to be complete. Previous proposals for basing PPAD-hardness on program obfuscation considered a strong “virtual black-box ” notion that is subject to severe limitations and is unlikely to be realizable for the programs in question. In contrast, for indistinguishability obfuscation no such limitations are known, and recently, several candidate constructions of indistinguishability obfuscation were suggested based on different hardness assumptions on multilinear maps. Our result provides further evidence of the intractability of finding a Nash equilibrium, one that is <b>extrinsic</b> to the <b>evidence</b> presented so far. ...|$|R

40|$|Interpreting key {{ecological}} parameters, such as diet, of extinct organisms {{without the}} benefit of direct observation or explicit fossil evidence poses a formidable challenge for paleobiological studies. To date, dietary categorizations of extinct taxa are largely generated by means of modern analogs; however, for many species the method is subject to considerable ambiguity. Here we present a refined approach for assessing trophic habits in fossil taxa and apply the method to coelurosaurian dinosaurs—a clade for which diet is particularly controversial. Our findings detect 21 morphological features that exhibit statistically significant correlations with <b>extrinsic</b> fossil <b>evidence</b> of coelurosaurian herbivory, such as stomach contents and a gastric mill. These traits represent quantitative, extrinsically founded proxies for identifying herbivorous ecomorphology in fossils and are robust despite uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships among major coelurosaurian subclades. The distribution of these features suggests that herbivory was widespread among coelurosaurians, with six major subclades displaying morphological evidence of the diet, and that contrary to previous thought, hypercarnivory was relatively rare and potentially secondarily derived. Given the potential for repeated, independent evolution of herbivory in Coelurosauria, we also test for repetitive patterns in the appearance of herbivorous traits within sublineages using rank concordance analysis. We find evidence for a common succession of increasing specialization to herbivory in the subclades Ornithomimosauria and Oviraptorosauria, perhaps underlain by intrinsic functional and/or developmental constraints, as well as evidence indicating that the early evolution of a beak in coelurosaurians correlates with an herbivorous diet...|$|R
40|$|An {{influential}} view of amnesia is {{that the}} recognition and recall failure {{is a consequence of}} a selective loss of memory for contextual, rather than target, information.

This hypothesis claims that amnesics suffer from a selective inability to remember background context i. e. spatiotemporal or <b>extrinsic</b> context. The <b>evidence</b> cited in support of this hypothesis is then critically reviewed and assessed in relation to two methodological problems. The first problem shows that when weak amnesic memory is compared with good normal memory qualitative differences in contextual memory may arise artef actually. The second problem is that contextual memory deficits, found in amnesics, may be incidental consequences of frontal cortex damage rather than essential to the core memory deficit. In the light of these problems it is concluded that currently there is no convincing support for the contextual memory deficit hypothesis of amnesia. Finally, guidelines are laid down which should enable the hypothesis to be more appropriately assessed, and an alternative kind of hypothesis is briefly outlined...|$|R

40|$|While {{electron}} spins in silicon heterostructures make attractive qubits, {{little is}} known about the coherence of electrons at the Si/SiO 2 interface. We report spin relaxation (T 1) and coherence (T 2) times for mobile electrons and natural quantum dots at a 28 Si/SiO 2 interface. Mobile electrons have short T 1 and T 2 of 0. 3 us at 5 K. In line with predictions, confining electrons and cooling increases T 1 to 0. 8 ms at 350 mK. In contrast, T 2 for quantum dots is around 10 us at 350 mK, increasing to 30 us when the dot density is reduced by a factor of two. The quantum dot T 2 is shorter than T 1, indicating that T 2 is not controlled by T 1 at 350 mK but is instead limited by an <b>extrinsic</b> mechanism.

40|$|Ewing sarcoma is {{the second}} most common bone cancer in {{children}} and adolescents, with poor prognosis and outcome in ~ 70 % of initial diagnoses and 10 - 15 % of relapses. Hydrophobic triterpene acids and hydrophilic lectins and viscotoxins from European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) demonstrate anticancer properties, but have not yet been investigated for Ewing sarcoma. Commercial Viscum album L. extracts are aqueous, excluding the insoluble triterpenes. We recreated a total mistletoe effect by combining an aqueous extract (viscum) and a triterpene extract (TT) solubilized with cyclodextrins. Ewing sarcoma cells were treated with viscum, TT and viscumTT in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. In vitro and ex vivo treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells with viscum inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion, while viscumTT combination treatment generated a synergistic effect. Apoptosis occurred via intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> apoptotic pathways, <b>evidenced</b> by activation of both CASP 8 and CASP 9. We show that viscumTT treatment shifts the balance of apoptotic regulatory proteins towards apoptosis, mainly via CLSPN, MCL 1, BIRC 5 and XIAP downregulation.

This Article concludes with two recommendations for the Iowa Supreme Court. First, consistently cite Iowa Code Section 4. 6 (3) when using legislative history to determine legislative intent. Second, formulate a more complex rule on the use of bill explanations in determining legislative intent, neither abandoning them completely nor always using them, but instead considering them as an <b>extrinsic</b> source of <b>evidence</b> for understanding a statute only when appropriate after analyzing the bill’s amendment history...|$|R

To further clarify the role of 5 -HT 2 B receptor in ocular development, we performed a gene gain of function analysis in vitro and in vivo in Xenopus embryos. We confirmed that 5 -HT 2 B overexpression is per se sufficient to promote cell proliferation in a neuroblastoma cell line. The in vivo experiments revealed that an over serotonin signaling, via 5 -HT 2 B receptors, resulted in the formation of eyes with an irregular form, position and orientation. Interestingly, we showed 5 -HT 2 B gene expression in periocular mesenchyme that represents a key signaling center required for a correct eye morphogenesis. Moreover, the 5 -HT 2 B receptor overexpressing retina, displays a disorganization of the typical laminar structure with the presence of retinal cells scattered in ectopic positions or forming rosette like structures. On the whole our data support the idea that serotonin signalling has to be finely regulated during eye development to allow a correct retinogenesis and may participate in the correct orchestration and synergism of all the factors and events that regulate eye morphogenesis in ocular and periocular tissues...|$|R
