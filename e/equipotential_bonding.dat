50|$|Shocks can {{be caused}} by direct or {{indirect}} contact. Contact with an exposed conductive part under fault conditions is called direct contact. IEC requires certain degrees of ingress protection against direct contact. Indirect contact protections can be achieved by earthed <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> and automatic disconnection of supply by using Residual Current Devices, for example.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1950s, {{isolated}} ground domestic mains supplies {{tended to have}} no Residual-Current Device (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred. This could leave metalwork in the house live. The use of Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or formerly ELCBs with such installs solved this problem. Such installs are called EEBAD (Earthed <b>Equipotential</b> <b>Bonding</b> and Automatic Disconnection).|$|E
50|$|<b>Equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> {{involves}} joining together metalwork that is {{or may be}} earthed {{so that it is}} at {{the same}} potential (i.e., voltage) everywhere. Such is commonly used under transformer banks by power companies and under large computer installations. Exact rules for electrical installations vary by country, locality, or supplying power company. <b>Equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> is done from the Service Panel consumer unit (also known as a fuse box, breaker box, or distribution board) to incoming water and gas services. It is also done in bathrooms where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including metal pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential. Isolated metal objects, including metal fittings fed by plastic pipe, are not required to be bonded. In Australia and South Africa, a house's earth cables must be connected both to an earthing rod driven into the ground and also to the plumbing or gas pipe.In Australia a house's earth cable must be connected to all reinforcing mesh in any concrete under any bathroom and in any swimming pool.|$|E
5000|$|In TN-C and TN-C-S systems, any {{connection}} between the combined neutral-and-earth core and {{the body of the}} earth could end up carrying significant current under normal conditions, and could carry even more under a broken neutral situation. Therefore, main <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> conductors must be sized with this in mind; use of TN-C-S is inadvisable in situations such as petrol stations, where there is a combination of lots of buried metalwork and explosive gases.|$|E
50|$|Electrically {{insulate}} the two metals {{from each}} other. If {{they are not}} in electrical contact, no galvanic coupling will occur. This can be achieved by using non-conductive materials between metals of different electropotential. Piping can be isolated with a spool of pipe made of plastic materials, or made of metal material internally coated or lined. It is important that the spool be a sufficient length to be effective. For reasons of safety, this should not be attempted where an electrical earthing system uses the pipework for its ground or has <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|E
50|$|Combined {{neutral and}} ground {{conductors}} {{are commonly used}} in electricity supply companies' wiring and occasionally for fixed wiring in buildings and for some specialist applications where there is little alternative, such as railways and trams. Since normal circuit currents in the neutral conductor can lead to objectionable or dangerous differences between local earth potential and the neutral, and to protect against neutral breakages, special precautions such as frequent rodding down to earth (multiple ground rod connections), use of cables where the combined neutral and earth completely surrounds the phase conductor(s), and thicker than normal <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> must be considered to ensure the system is safe.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyze {{earthing}} systems for houses. By practical measurements and theoretical analyzes consequences of possible faults, that can occur within the facility and in the low-voltage distribution network, is illustrated.    The reason for this project is that nowadays one has to arrange with a main <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system for buildings. Apart from that, if necessary, bathrooms must be provided with a supplementary <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system. The practical measurements verify that potential differences in facilities {{may be due to}} voltage drops in the PEN conductor between the origin of the electrical installation and the power transformer. Based on the theoretical analyzes of possible faults, it is considered that the requirement for  supplementary <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> systems for bathrooms in most cases can be questioned, when basic insulation, fault protection, residual current devise and main <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system already provides an adequate level of protection. A PEN conductor loss may result in a situation where metallic parts attached to the <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system starts working as earth electrodes. <b>Equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system may also increase the incidence of stray currents. If TN-C-S systems is provided with a local connection to earth a redundant system against PEN conductor loss is obtained. That is not the case for neutral conductor loss in TN-S systems with a local connection to earth. If district heating pipes is supplied with insulated flanges it prevents stray currents and foreign potential to be spread in the district heating network...|$|E

40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous conductive parts (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous conductive parts and exposed conductive parts is zeroed and extraneous conductive parts {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous conductive parts to the protective <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous conductive parts are present but not connected to the protective <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal. Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to study the hazardous environment created in the neighborhoods {{in the event of}} a lightning strike to the Telecommunication tower. This thesis provides comprehensive analysis on the lightning scenarios in 18 communication and broadcasting towers situated in similar and different isokeraunic contours in Sri Lanka. The results and observation show that most of the damages reported due to the indirect lightning flashes, power line surges and step voltage in the event of lightning strike to the tower. The property damages such as patches and cracks developed in their walls and floors, the damages to electrical and electronic equipment such as electrical switch gears, bulbs, socket outlets, televisions, and radios also reported. The personal injuries were in the form of temporary paralysis due to step potential or electric shock. In one case, the victims were sleeping on floor in his home which is located around 40 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. In another case the victims were sitting on the chair with legs on the ground in his home which is located around 30 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. The descriptions indicate that they have been subjected to step potential. The above scenarios with related to the lightning strikes to telecommunication tower going to explain with the geographical arrangement of tower surround, Earth resistance values measured, tower grounding arrangement, power line lightning protection system and the commercial power distribution to the area by Earth resistance tester, technical theories and simulation software. The outcome also shows that <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> of the grounding system, a distributed grounding network including a ring conductor and a suitable system of surge protective devices to radio base stations and neighborhood homes play a much vital role in lightning protection of equipment and safety of neighborhood people compared to the effects of simply achieving a low grounding resistance. However, in the absence of such integrated, distributed and equipotentialized grounding system, a high value of ground resistance will sharply increase the possibility of accidents and damag...|$|E
