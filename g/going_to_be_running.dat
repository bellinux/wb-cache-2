40|$|SUMMARY The {{burning of}} the fossil fuels for {{electricity}} generation has an environmental impact on a global scale. Also, the world is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>running</b> out of the fossil fuels before or within the next century. This {{is the reason why}} renewable energy sources are used more often. The growth of renewable energy can be expected to continue, because of the European targets which are set for future share of renewable energy of almost 100 % in 2050. The problem with the electricity production from renewable sources is the mismatch between demand and supply. Wind is not always available at a wind park and the sun does not always shine all day and every day on solar panels. This can vary from minutes to seasons. One of the potential possibilities to cope with this problem is to store the electricity directly or indirectly in an energy storage facility during the time when the electricity production is higher than the electricity demand. When the electricity production is lower than the electricity demand, the stored electricity is supplied to the electricity grid. The main research question in this research is: To which extend can be the role of large scale energy storage systems in the Dutch electricity grid to intercept the mismatch between the electricity demand and the electricity production from renewable sources to meet the European targets in 2050 ? Literature research shows that wind onshore and offshore, and fewer solar photovoltaic and biomass, are the most potential renewable energy sources for electricity production in the Netherlands. Data patterns of the wind electricity production and electricity demand with chronological time intervals of 1 hour over a whole year are used in the simulation program PowerPlan. PowerPlan is used to generate the Dutch electricity demand and production till 2050, where the European target is met. The chronological hourly patterns of the total electricity demand and production in 2050 are used as input for the model made with GoldSim. This model is used to calculate the electricity surplus and shortage and to see to which extend energy storage systems can dissolve the mismatch. For this, five energy storage systems are included, which are considered from a literature study as the best storage systems for large scale use. These are: an energy island (inverted pumped hydro storage on the North Sea), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and three kinds of Flow Battery Energy Storage (FBES). The results show that the total electricity shortage over 2050 is 6. 4 TWh. An energy capacity of 1. 2 TWh from the storage systems is needed to dissolve this electricity shortage. The needed power capacity of the storage systems is 10. 3 GW for charging and 8. 5 GW for discharging. To have a technical reliable Dutch electricity grid in 2050, 40 Energy Islands, 140 CAES systems or 10, 000 PSB systems are needed. These scenarios are not very practical, because of the required space and locations. A more practical scenario is a combination of 2 Energy Islands, 20 CAES systems and 100 of each type Flow Battery Energy Storage, but this scenario is not technical reliable. The only economical attractive scenarios are the technical reliable scenario with 140 CAES systems and the practical scenario without FBES systems, but these are respectively not practical and not technical reliable. The main conclusion of this research is: Large scale energy storage systems in the Dutch electricity grid can technically intercept the mis-match between the electricity demand and the electricity production from renewable sources for 100 % to meet the European targets in 2050, but this is not practical through the needed space and not economical attractive. The results also show that 150 GWh storage capacity (12. 5 % of the 1. 2 TWh needed storage capacity) dissolves 50 % of the electricity shortage. This can be done by 1 Energy Island and 20 CAES systems. For the other 50 %, 1. 05 TWh more capacity is needed. This could be dissolved with the use of other alternatives, for example the installation of gas turbines. This is economical attractive, but then the European target for 2050 is not met. Another alternative is the use of an European electricity grid. ...|$|E
