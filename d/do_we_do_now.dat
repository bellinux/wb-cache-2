2500|$|Since its completion, the {{building}} has won a number of awards for architecture. In October 2004, the architect was awarded the 2004 RIBA Stirling Prize. For {{the first time in}} the prize's history, the judges were unanimous. In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster and Partners on the design of {{the building}}, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: [...] "I was looking at the glass all around and , 'Why on earth <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that?' <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> would <b>do</b> things differently". The building featured in recent films such as Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Russell Crowe's A Good Year, Sharon Stone's Basic Instinct 2, and Woody Allen's Match Point and, rechristened the Spirit of London, became the spaceship centrepiece of Keith Mansfield's 2008 novel Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London.|$|R

50|$|During {{his early}} {{life as a}} painter - 1930 to 1950 - Weiss was {{influenced}} by old Dutch masters such as Pieter Breughel, and Hieronymus Bosch. After World War II his painting, {{as well as his}} work in film and literature, came under the lasting influence of Surrealism. He taught painting at Stockholm's People's University, and illustrated a Swedish edition of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. In 1952 he joined the Swedish Experimental Film Studio, where he directed several experimental short films, followed by several socially conscious documentary shorts: Gesichter im Schatten (Faces in the Shadow, 1956), Im Namen des Gesetzes (In the Name of the Law, 1957), Was machen wir jetzt? (What <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Now?,</b> 1958). In 1959 he directed his only full length (experimental) film Hägringen (The Disappeared). In the early 1950s, Weiss had begun to write again, producing a number of prose works, some in German, others in Swedish. Most are short, intense, surrealist text which suggest the influence of Kafka (whose work Weiss would later adapt for the stage).|$|E
5000|$|According to the legend, {{a certain}} peasant who sought {{a way to}} do less work, was advised to go to certain shop of Bayonne and buy a box of galtzagorriak. He did that and, when he was back to his farm, he opened the small box. A bunch of little imps with red pants jumped {{immediately}} from it asking [...] "what do we do, what do we do?" [...] He immediately put them to work: repair the fence, prepare the land, milk the cows, redo the ceiling... in few minutes the galtzagorriak had done all the jobs and asked again [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now,</b> what do we do now?". The peasant ordered them to do many other things and again the job was done in minutes. But the galtzagorriak kept asking what to do. The more than pleased peasant had to say: [...] "nothing". Frustrated the imps started to undo all the jobs they had done. Eventually, the peasant managed to get them back into their box and, from then on, he decided to do his job by himself.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the 22nd century, a strange man appears, claiming {{to be the head}} of the Opposition. (It later transpires that the Opposition is a future version of Kronotek). The man asks Koell if it is wrong to change terrible events that already happened, to which Koell answers yes, because [...] "dark days teach valuable lessons and define who we are". The Man then shoots Koell twice, once in the chest and once in the head. When confronted by Morris and Dexter, he explains that the Welshes and Petrovich were ancestors of scientists who invented a DNA sequencer that can target the genomes defining racial identity. He goes on to explain that this DNA sequencer was stolen and used by less talented Middle Eastern scientists to create a virus that targeted people of European descent. 2 billion died as a result (including eight out of every ten people in North America). As Dexter laments the loss of his family, the strange man states that this crisis has been averted because of the Opposition's interference with the time stream. Although he makes clear that Kronotek's ultimate goal is still the preservation of the time stream, he indicates that this one exception was made. The strange man then says that his Kronotek has use for talented agents such as Morris and Dexter and invites them to join his agency, leaving an open time bubble for them to enter. As the strange man departs, Dexter looks at the camera and says, [...] "What the Hell <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> brother?" ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Purpose: Vision-based body {{tracking}} technologies, {{originally developed}} for the consumer gaming market, are being repurposed to form {{the core of a}} range of innovative healthcare applications in the clinical assessment and rehabilitation of movement ability. Vision-based body tracking has substantial potential, but there are technical limitations. Method: We use our "stories from the field" to articulate the challenges and offer examples of how these can be overcome. Results: We illustrate that: (i) substantial effort is needed to determine the measures and feedback vision-based body tracking should provide, accounting for the practicalities of the technology (e. g. range) as well as new environments (e. g. home). (ii) Practical considerations are important when planning data capture so that data is analysable, whether finding ways to support a patient or ensuring everyone does the exercise in the same manner. (iii) Home is a place of opportunity for vision-based body tracking, but what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> in the clinic (e. g. balance tests) or in the home (e. g. play games) will require modifications to achieve capturable, clinically relevant measures. Conclusions: This article articulates how vision-based body tracking works and when it does not to continue to inspire our clinical colleagues to imagine new applications. Implications for Rehabilitation Vision-based body tracking has quickly been repurposed to form the core of innovative healthcare applications in clinical assessment and rehabilitation, but there are clinical as well as practical challenges to make such systems a reality. Substantial effort needs to go into determining what types of measures and feedback vision-based body tracking should provide. This needs to account for the practicalities of the technology (e. g. range) as well as the opportunities of new environments (e. g. the home). Practical considerations need to be accounted for when planning capture in a particular environment so that data is analysable, whether it be finding a chair substitute, ways to support a patient or ensuring everyone does the exercise in the same manner. The home is a place of opportunity with vision-based body tracking, but it would be naïve to think that <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> in the clinic (e. g. balance tests) or in the home (e. g. play games), without appropriate modifications to what constitutes a practically capturable, clinically relevant measure...|$|R

40|$|So far, we {{have argued}} that the impact on {{development}} of the consider-able education progress recorded in the region has been less than ex-pected in terms of economic growth, the promotion of equality, and re-duction of poverty. How much of this outcome is the consequence of particular characteristics of the region’s education systems and how much is due to weak linkages between education and labor markets is dif-ficult to discern. We nevertheless conclude that the continuing gap be-tween education and development outcomes may lead policy makers to consider alternative paths of educational development in the future. Furthermore, the conditions under which education systems con-tribute to economic and social development have changed and this also argues for considering alternative paths of education development. The “road not traveled for education reform ” in the MENA region also refers to the fact that education systems must now travel over new and rela-tively unexplored terrain. Education systems have a tendency to spawn a new set of challenges for every problem resolved. Once everyone is in school, we must ensure that they do not drop out. Once they remain seated, we must make sure that they learn something. Once they appear to be ready to learn, we must make sure that the material is useful for their future and ours. Thus, some aspects of the new terrain that educa-tion systems must cross have been shaped by the education system itself. In this context, MENA countries have succeeded in providing most el-igible children with educational opportunities, thus narrowing gender, rural, and socioeconomic gaps in access to schooling. This has led to strains resulting from the maintenance costs of the established education apparatus; new demands for instruction at post-compulsory levels of ed-ucation; and the consequent costs of ongoing inefficiencies: dropouts, low graduate employment, and ambivalent learning outcomes. Essentially, the question facing education authorities in many MENA countries is: What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> that we have almost reached education for all...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of this paper the 'user' {{includes}} all those involved in the management of a geothermal resource. The objective of reservoir modelling and simulation, in my view, should be to supply these 'users' with appropriate and reliable data so that they can make sound decisions, whether these be in financial or engineering fields. The scale of models would thus extend from a single w e l l, which may require a workover to remove mineral deposition costing, say, $ 30, 000, to a full geothermal field development, costing more than $ 100 million. Geothermal development work can involve high risks. With the aid of modelling {{it should be possible to}} quantify risks, and, if these are considered excessive, to identify what data should be obtained to reduce them. Schemes relying on a single well are particularly hazardous. In 1974 an alfalfa drying plant was built at Broadlands next to well BR 7. This well had previously been flow tested for three years, showing very reliable discharge characteristics. But when opened to supply the drying plant, the well did not perform satisfactorily and a 350 m pipeline was built to supply steam from another nearby productive w e l l. A l l geothermal developments involve drilling and this, also, is a risky business. In New Zealand, over the last six years, the time to drill a 1200 - 1400 m investigation well shows variations of 240 % about the average (using the same rig and equipment). The time for workovers is even more variable, due to unforeseen downhole conditions affecting progress - an overrun of 100 % would not be unexpected. What information does the user want? Basic data w i l l be the power-life and likely discharge characteristics of a field given certain operating conditions. For example, i f we have a liquid dominated field, the design engineers w i l l require information about changing enthalpy, gas and total flow for the system as a whole and for each individual well. There is no point in fitting a well with equipment to handle 100 t/h of separated steam if, after three years' production, it will only produce 50 t/h. Those providing finance for a scheme will require an assurance of its viability. How many years can the field sustain the projected withdrawal rate? For a well repair operation, those providing funds will want to know the chances of success and how much steam the well might produce if the operation succeeds. These factors must be balanced against the estimated cost of the operation, which itself identified in the first place. In a field which has been operating for some years, the question arises: What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now?</b> Do we increase production, or do nothing, or maybe manage the field by operating only selected wells. Whatever the choice, predictions of future field and well performance are required to allow the field operator to evaluate the economics of alternative schemes...|$|E
