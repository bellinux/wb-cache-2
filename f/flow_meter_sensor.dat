The raw data validation is inspired on the Spanish norm (AENOR-UNE norm 500540). The methodology consists in assigning a quality level to data.

The methodology takes into account not only spatial models but also temporal models relating the different sensors. The methodology is applied to real-data acquired from the ATLLc Water Network.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} and demonstrated a novel sequence in MEMS fabrication process flow. The novel MEMS fabrication process flow can be shortly {{described as a}} “packaging first, MEMS release second”, whereas a standard process starts form MEMS release and ends up with packaging. The process is explored on a 3 D capacitive MEMS sensor (3 × 3 mm 2). Unreleased wafer is singulated by sawing on individual dies, then the individual sensor is mounted to the package, wire bonded and encapsulated. Because the sensors are still unreleased there is no damage occurred during the assembly. However the choice for the encapsulant material is not evident. The encapsulant must survive the chemical attack during the MEMS release process (mixture of 73 %HF and IPA (isopropanol)), followed by a triple rinse in IPA. We pre-selected 6 different encapsulants: a silicone-, an epoxy- and an urethane-based. At least one encapsulant passed the acceptance criteria: there is no delamination, there is no texture change and the encapsulant maintains a sufficient mechanical adhesion. Additionally to that we measured micro-hardness of the encapsulant {{before and after the}} HF release test. We also performed an electrical characterization of the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> <b>sensor</b> before and after the HF release and we detected no changes in the sensor's performance caused by HF exposure. We {{have proposed}} and demonstrated a novel sequence for MEMS fabrication. We packaged the sensor first, and performed the release after that. The key enabler for the novel process is the encapsulant which can withstand an exposure to the release solution (73 %HF:IPA) ...|$|E
40|$|Transporting liquids in {{pipelines}} is {{considered as one}} of the most economically feasible methods due to the controlled and safe media these liquids are transported within. The transportation of liquids through strategic pipelines and for hundreds of kilometers is also considered {{as one of the}} most power consuming sectors due to the turbulent mode these liquids are transported with. Additional supporting pumping station along the pipeline was one of the solutions applied, but its application added an additional cost to the total cost of transportation. The addition of polymeric additives to the main flow was proven to be a successful solution to the pumping power dissipation {{in pipelines}} due to the visco-elastic properties of these polymers that can suppress the turbulent structures inside the pipe. Most of these polymeric additives are not biodegradable and not environmentally friendly. In this present work, a new environmental friendly, soluble and insoluble Drag Reducing Agents (DRA) is introduced. These new additives are driven from plant and byproduct of tin industries which are okra mucilage from lady finger and slag particles. The drag reduction performances of the new additives were tested in water and hydrocarbon media. The water-soluble okra mucilage and the slag powder drag reduction performance were tested in water solution. To test the okra mucilage in hydrocarbon solution, the solubility of the original okra mucilage was changed using grafting co-polymerization technique. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of this novel DRA based on classical parameters which are additive concentration, fluid velocity, internal pipe diameter and pipe length. Experimental closed loop circulation rig consisted of three different pipes diameter (0. 0381 m D. I, 0. 0254 m D. I and 0. 0127 m D. I) with 2. 0 m pipe length were setup in order to accomplish the objectives. The transported solution was flowing through pipelines from tank into required testing section for pressure drop determination. A ball valve located at recirculation pipes used to control the flow rate of solution entering testing section the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> <b>sensor</b> and pressure sensors located at each testing section will give reading at screen by SCADA software. From experimental results, highest Percentage Drag Reduction (%Dr) were obtained on 0. 0381 m D. I with 78 % flowing through Re equal to 29017. 44, 1000 ppm and 0. 5 m pipe length for hydrocarbon liquid and 80 % flowing through Re equal to 118235. 42, 1000 ppm and 0. 5 m for water as transported media. For slag particles analysis, highest %Dr was obtained on 0. 0381 m D. I with 70 % flowing through Re equal to 29017. 44, 1000 ppm and 0. 5 m pipe length. While, for water, highest %Dr where obtained at 0. 0381 m D. I with 80 % flowing through Re = 118235. 42, 1000 ppm and 0. 5 m pipe length. The fluid velocity effect give increment and decrement pattern depend on Re-%Dr relation curve. Increasing additive concentration and pipe diameter will increased the %Dr. The %Dr reading for the pipe length effects gives unnoticeable changes. However, it is predicted to decrease for polymeric DRA since the breakup of polymer when facing shear stress. Time consumption shows polymer are able to resist increment of pressure drop at certain period. However, suspended solid DRA show consistent %Dr reading with time consumption. A mathematical expression by using STATISTICA software was developed to delineate and verified the real mechanism of Drag Reduction (DR). As a conclusion, new greener DRA were successfully introduced and its effectiveness in improving the flow was proven experimentally...|$|E

40|$|In the {{capillary}} type {{thermal mass}} <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> the <b>sensor</b> {{is a small}} diameter stainless steel or constantan capillary, heated by an electric current. The heat is supplied either at the central point or over the whole length of the tube. In the absence of gas flow, the temperature profile is symmetric about the mid point. Gas flow through the capillary tube cools the entry section while heating the exit. This introduces an asymmetry in the temperature profile, which {{is a measure of}} the fluid flow rate. The asymmetry is measured in terms of difference of temperature between two suitably chosen points on the capillary tube, which are equidistant from the mid point on opposite sides. This temperature difference is a function of the direction and rate of mass flow of the fluid.

At the end of 2009, HelioTrough collectors were installed and have been continuously operated in the SEGS-V field at Kramer Junction (California, USA) for testing and demonstration purposes since then.

40|$|A robust {{fibre optic}} flow sensor has been {{developed}} to measure liquid or gas flows at ambient temperatures up to 300 °C and pressures up to 100 bar. While such environmental conditions are typical in pressurized steam systems in {{the oil and gas}} industry (downhole and surface), wider applications are envisaged. The flow sensor uses a specially-designed bluff body to generate vortex-induced pressure fluctuations as a function of flow. The pressure fluctuations result in mechanical strain fluctuations in the sensor plate which is attached to the bluff-body. This is detected by means of a Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG). The frequency of the pressure fluctuations is proportional to the flow velocity and is measured by analyzing the spectrum of the FBG sensor signal.
