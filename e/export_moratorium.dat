40|$|The Fijian sea {{cucumber}} fishery {{began in the}} early 1800 ’s in response to demand from Asian markets for bêche-de-mer. The fishery has shown classic ‘boom and bust’ production cycles for much of its life. From 1984 - 2012 a total of 8, 620 t of bêche-de-mer were exported from Fiji. Particularly large volumes were exported in 1987 (> 600 t), 1988 (> 700 t) and 1996 (> 600 t) and declines in export volumes are notable following these peaks. Subsequent export peaks of around 400 t in 2005 and 2011, are considerably lower than those in the 1980 s and 1990 s and after 2005, annual exports averaged 243 t. Between 2003 and 2012 export volumes of high value species declined from 14 - 8 %, while that of medium value species increased from 50 - 59 %. Sandfish (Holothuria scabra) appeared on export manifests in 2003 and 2004 despite an <b>export</b> <b>moratorium</b> for this species. Despite numerous recommendations to improved sustainability of the Fijian {{sea cucumber}} fishery, management measures consist primarily of an export size limit of 7. 62 cm for bêche-de-mer. Over-exploitation of the resource and declining sea cucumber stocks have resulted. A historic overview of the Fijian sea cucumber fishery was provided {{within the context of the}} various fishery management approached adopted by other South Pacific Island nations. It includes data gathered by interviews with sea cucumber fishermen, bêche-de-mer processors and other stakeholders and makes recommendations for an effective management plan for a fishery that is an important livelihood activity for coastal communities in Fiji...|$|E
