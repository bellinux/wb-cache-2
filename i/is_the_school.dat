They argue that profits (or surpluses) from these co-operative wholesale societies should be paid as dividends to the member co-operators, rather than to their workers.|$|E

25|$|Upper Canada College {{occupies}} an open, 17 hectare (43 acre) {{campus in}} Deer Park, near the major intersection of Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue, {{in the residential}} neighbourhood of Forest Hill. There are 15 buildings on the site: The main structure (the Upper School), constructed between 1959 and 1960, central on the campus, and with a dominant clock tower, houses the secondary school component of the college, in a quadrangle form. Laidlaw Hall, the principal assembly hall, featuring a full theatre stage and a pipe organ, {{is attached to the}} west end of the Upper School and, at the other end, is the Memorial Wing, the school's main infirmary. Closing {{the north end of the}} main quadrangle (which is the location of the statue of the Lord Seaton, installed in 1934) is one building, built in 1932, that contains the two boarding houses, as well as two private residences for the associated boarding masters, adjacent to which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> chapel, donated by Governor General Vincent Massey. Satellite to this complex are townhouse-style residences for masters and their families; the residence of the college's principal, Grant House, built in 1917; and a small, two-storey cricket pavilion, inaugurated by Governor General Raymond Hnatyshyn. The Preparatory School, part of which was designed by Eden Smith, is at the south-west corner of the campus, near which is a home for the Prep headmaster and a small gatehouse.|$|E

25|$|For marching band, schools {{compete against}} other {{schools in the}} same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into seven areas for Class 5A and 6A schools, and five areas for Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A schools. All schools of all classes compete in region {{competition}} annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Class 4A and Class 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 5A can advance from region to area and state. In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, {{they need to get}} an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs {{to make it to the}} Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.|$|E
