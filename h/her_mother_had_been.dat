Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour.

500|$|Before Mary Godwin, Clairmont, and Shelley {{had left}} for the Continent, Imlay and Mary had had a major {{argument}} and no chance {{to come to a}} reconciliation. Imlay attempted in her letters to Mary to smooth over the relationship, but her sense of loneliness and isolation in London was palpable. She wrote to Mary of [...] "the dreadful state of mind I generally labour under & which I in vain endeavour to get rid of". Many scholars attribute Imlay's increasing unhappiness to Mrs Godwin's hostility towards her. Kegan, and others, contend that Imlay was subject to the same [...] "extreme depression to which <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> subject, and which marked other members of the Wollstonecraft family". Wandering amongst the mountains of Switzerland, frustrated with her relationship with Shelley, and engrossed by the writing of Frankenstein, her sister was unsympathetic.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard was {{survived by}} his wife Mary Sue and all of his {{children}} except his second son Quentin. His will provided a trust fund to support Mary Sue; her children Arthur, Diana and Suzette; and Katherine, the daughter of his first wife Polly. He disinherited two of his other children. L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. had become estranged, changed his name to [...] "Ronald DeWolf" [...] and, in 1982, sued unsuccessfully for control of his father's estate. Alexis Valerie, Hubbard's daughter by his second wife Sara, had attempted to contact her father in 1971. She was rebuffed with the implied claim that her real father was Jack Parsons rather than Hubbard, and that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a Nazi spy during the war. Both later accepted settlements when litigation was threatened. In 2001, Diana and Suzette were reported to still be Church members, while Arthur had left and become an artist. Hubbard's great-grandson, Jamie DeWolf, is a noted slam poet.|$|E
500|$|In his memoirs, written {{more than}} thirty years after her death, her father wrote of Elisabeth's [...] "deep sensitivity" [...] and [...] "very large heart." [...] He wrote that [...] "I never knew a child who had so much {{influence}} on adults. Her inner personality was very strong, and she had a natural quality that protected her from being spoiled." [...] In October 1901, after the death of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth's parents finally divorced. Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin, her future husband, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia. Her father, according to letters written by <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> caught cavorting with domestic servants. Her parents' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother's new home in Coburg. Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce, although Victoria did her best to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902. She was only partially successful, though Victoria enjoyed turning her daughter into an outstanding horsewoman.|$|E

500|$|Weinman's obverse bears a {{resemblance}} to Oscar Roty's [...] "Sower" [...] design for French coins; according to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, [...] "Weinman {{has taken the}} ideal of a nineteenth century provincial figure {{and turned it into}} an American icon." [...] Burdette ties both the appearance of the head of Liberty and of the branches which she carries to Baltimore's Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument, designed by Weinman. [...] The sculptor may also have drawn inspiration from a 1913 bust he did of his tenant, Elsie Stevens, wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens. [...] Elsie Stevens is generally believed to have been a model for Weinman's Mercury dime; her daughter Holly wrote in 1966 that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the model for both coins. [...] The reverse is similar to Weinman's medal for the American Institute of Architects, although the sculptor replaced the laurel on the medal with a pine sapling. Weinman's work on the medal had been widely admired for the power of the depicted eagle.|$|E
500|$|Fools for Scandal was {{the only}} film Lombard made in 1938. By this time, she was devoted to a {{relationship}} with Clark Gable. Four years after their teaming on No Man of Her Own, the pair had reunited at a Hollywood party and began a romance early in 1936. The media took great interest in their partnership and frequently questioned if they would wed. Gable was separated from his wife, Rhea Langham, {{but she did not}} want to grant him a divorce. As his relationship with Lombard became serious, Langham eventually agreed to a settlement worth half a million dollars. The divorce was finalized in March 1939, and Gable and Lombard eloped in Kingman, Arizona, on March 29. The couple—both lovers of the outdoors—bought a 20-acre ranch in Encino, California, where they kept barnyard animals and enjoyed hunting trips. Almost immediately, Lombard [...] wanted to start a family, but her attempts failed; after two miscarriages and numerous trips to fertility specialists, she was unable to have children. In early 1938, Lombard officially joined the Bahá'í Faith, of which <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a member since 1922.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Device {{was charged}} with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, {{together}} with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that [...] "this odious witch" [...] suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked {{to stand up and}} give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a familiar called Ball, who appeared {{in the shape of a}} brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying he had seen her making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.|$|E

500|$|A {{few years}} later, when World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse {{with her mother}} and Olga. They cared for wounded {{soldiers}} in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, [...] "Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases." [...] Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. [...] "Why can you breathe carbolic acid and I can't?" [...] she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee known simply as the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was strongly patriotic and apologized in a 29 October 1914 letter for saying something negative about the Germans in her mother's presence. She explained that she forgot <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born in Germany because she thought of Alexandra as only Russian. The Tsarina responded that she did feel completely Russian and Tatiana had not hurt her feelings with her sharp words, but Alexandra was hurt by the actions of her former countrymen and by the gossip she heard about her own German connections.|$|E

Although a slaveholder himself, Bates represented slaves in some freedom suits in St. Louis, including the case of the freed slave Polly Berry's daughter, who was still enslaved. After gaining own her freedom in 1843, Berry enlisted Edward Bates as her attorney in her daughter's case. Bates argued that, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, since <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> proved a free woman {{at the time of her}} daughter's birth, the child was free.
