This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.|$|E
5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E

Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E

5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E

Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample {{are the same as}} driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a commercial driver's license (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or greater, drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% or greater, or refuse to submit a breath sample.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{formally}} established constitution dictating the laws, organization, and divisions {{of power in}} ancient Macedonia's government, although some tangential evidence suggests this. The king (basileus) served {{as the head of}} state and was assisted by his noble companions (hetairoi) and royal pages. The Macedonian kings had command over certain natural resources such as gold from mining and timber from logging. They were also expected to serve as high priests of the nation, using their wealth to sponsor various religious cults. The ancient Macedonian army arguably exercised its authority in matters such as the royal succession when there was no clear heir apparent. The army upheld some of the functions of a popular assembly, a democratic institution which otherwise existed in only a handful of municipal governments within the Macedonian commonwealth, the Koinon of Macedonians. The Macedonian kings served as the commanders-in-chief of Macedonia's armed forces, while it was common for them to personally lead troops into battle.|$|E
5|$|South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) {{had been}} granted {{permission}} by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from Christmas Island. Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the U.S. government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help {{so long as the}} dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, {{had been granted}} to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{government of}} ancient Macedonia {{was that of}} its monarchy, lasting until 167BC when it was abolished by the Romans. The Macedonian hereditary monarchy existed {{since at least the}} time of Archaic Greece, with Homeric aristocratic roots in Mycenaean Greece. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages, Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions, each having its own petty king, the tribes of Lower Macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over the lesser kings of Upper Macedonia. The direct line of father-to-son succession was broken after the assassination of Orestes of Macedon in 396BC (allegedly by his regent and successor Aeropus II of Macedon), clouding the issue of whether primogeniture was the established custom or <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> constitutional right for an assembly of the army or of the people to choose another king. It is unclear if the male offspring of Macedonian queens or consorts were always preferred over others given the accession of Archelaus I of Macedon, son of Perdiccas II of Macedon and a slave woman, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father's designated heir apparent.|$|E
