50|$|In 1952 <b>drop</b> <b>pits</b> were {{fitted to}} the service pits on roads 2-9 in No.2 shed, with the jacks on 2-4 roads being 30 LT capacity, the remanning jacks were of 15 LT capacity. A 1 LT radial hoist was fitted in the roof {{covering}} all 21 roads running above the <b>drop</b> <b>pits.</b> A second 7 LT capacity radial hoist was fitted over the <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> roads. At the same time 11 of the existing service pits in No.2 shed were lengthened to 83 ft in length.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{placed over the}} drop table, and the {{connections}} attaching the wheelset to the vehicle are unfastened. This allows the wheel set to 'float' independently of the locomotive. The wheelset is lowered into the <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> on a short section of rail, and a dummy rail, normally {{a part of the}} drop table machinery, is then inserted in the gap over the lowered wheelset. This enables the vehicle to be moved clear of the drop table on its remaining wheels, so that the removed wheelset can then be lifted out of the <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> for maintenance work to be performed on it.|$|R
50|$|A {{drop table}} or wheel drop is a device used in railway {{engineering}} during maintenance jobs {{that require the}} removal of locomotive or rolling stock wheelsets. The machine is built in a <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> allowing a locomotive or rolling stock to be rolled onto it, avoiding the need for heavy cranes or jacks to lift the vehicle off the rails.|$|R
50|$|In March 1988 tenders {{were called}} for the design, manufacture, {{installation}} and commissioning of a drop table. This drop table was fitted to No.4 road in No.2 shed, {{as part of this}} work No.3 road was removed along with the original <b>drop</b> <b>pits</b> on roads 2 to 5 along with the original inspection pits on roads 1 to 5. The pit on road 5 was replaced by a raised rail with depressed floor type.|$|R

50|$|In 1978 {{the depot}} saw its first {{expansion}} as British Rail decided to base the Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train at the depot. Part {{of the expansion}} saw {{the extension of the}} maintenance shed by fully three coach lengths to allow for the additional passenger rakes into which the APT was formed. Additional equipment was installed including a 15 tonne overhead crane, a purpose built wheel <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> for removing the axles on the articulated bogies of the APT.|$|R
50|$|The term 'pitch' is {{also used}} by cavers {{to refer to a}} very steep or {{vertical}} section (called a <b>drop,</b> <b>pit,</b> or shaft) in a cave that needs ladders or single rope technique to descend and ascend (a drop that can be descended and ascended without equipment is a 'climb'). As caving rope lengths are not standardized, the length of a pitch is usually equal to that of the drop. The deepest underground pitch is 603 m in Vrtiglavica Cave in the Julian Alps, Slovenia.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} plan {{had called for}} two roundhouses {{to be built in}} Rockhampton, however only one was to be constructed. Foundation work began in August 1913 for a complete circle roundhouse with 52 stalls allocated for stabling locomotives in traffic. <b>Drop</b> <b>pits</b> were to be constructed, along with inspection pits. The central element of the roundhouse was to be a revolving turntable allowing for access to each of the engine bays and individual stalls. In a design similar to the North Ipswich roundhouse an external circular running road was provided to accommodate a shunt locomotive held captive serving as a mobile boiler for wash out purposes.|$|R

50|$|In July 1989 {{demolition}} {{was completed}} {{of the original}} No.1 roundhouse building along with the mess room adjacent to No.2 shed. After the demolition of No.1 shed the turntable pit and surrounding radial roads were nominally raised by 470mm to lessen the effect of groundwater. As part of this raising all of the servicing pits surrounding No.1 turntable were in filled. In 1991 further modifications took place to the pits surrounding No.2 turntable, with the outdoor section of the pits on roads 6 & 7 being infilled so that the pits only ran inside of the shed. The pits on 8 to 10 roads along with the <b>drop</b> <b>pits</b> on roads 8 & 9 were also filled in. The 2 surviving outdoor 'Garratt' inspection pits on roads 25 & 26 were also filled in.|$|R
5000|$|Original {{facilities}} provided {{include a}} single manually operated 75 ft diameter turntable with 42 radiating roads. Twenty {{one of these}} roads were covered by a wooden framed roundhouse building clad in corrugated sheeting. All 21 roads in the roundhouse had 60 ft long <b>pits,</b> radial <b>drop</b> <b>pits</b> were fitted to all 21 roads. Two elevated 50000 imp gal tanks fed three 9 in diameter water columns. An office for the District Locomotive Engineer (referred to as the DLE) was constructed using concrete drop panels. An office building for the Superintendent, Steam Shed Inspector, Timkeepers & Clerks was built near the water tanks [...] along with a rest barracks for crews from other depots that was located near the depot, with both of these buildings also using the concrete drop panel method of construction.|$|R
50|$|A {{new engine}} shed was built {{alongside}} the earlier one in 1926. This structure {{has since been}} demolished and a new building provided over the inspection and <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> in 1983. It serves today as a wagon shed. Another shed having a bow string trussed roof similar to the original engine shed of 1882 is in situ {{and may have been}} built with parts obtained from this building or the original carriage shed. It was noted in 1964 that work had begun painting the station building. A fire in 1968 damaged the western (refreshment room) section of the station building. The building was subsequently repaired.The station building was listed by the National Trust in 1972. The refreshment rooms were reported to have been closed in May 1985. The station building was refurbished in February 1986, with the former refreshment rooms being used as offices and the platform shade being shortened by 1 metre.|$|R
50|$|Archeological {{excavation}} {{has revealed}} {{a wealth of}} artifacts, including animal effigy figures; hand-molded, baked-clay cooking objects; simple thick-walled pottery; stone vessels, spear points, adzes, hoes, drills, edge-retouched flakes, and blades. Stone cooking balls were used to prepare meals. Scholars believe dozens of the cooking balls were heated in a bonfire and <b>dropped</b> in <b>pits</b> along with food. Different-shaped balls controlled cooking temperatures and cooking time.|$|R
40|$|Property Description Mistra Battery {{was built}} {{during the reign}} of Grand Master Pinto. It does not appear in the {{original}} list of 1715 / 16 Batteries though the sum of 133 scudi is documented to have been forwarded {{for the construction of a}} battery at Mistra Bay in 1714 by Com. Mongontier. The battery consists of a roughly semi-circular gun platform, devoid of parapet and defended by a shallow rock hewn ditch. On the landward side, the battery has two blockhouse linked by a central redan (with musketry loopholes) which also contains the main entrance. The redan is also fitted with an upper walkway and is reached through a hatch in the roof of one of the blockhouses. The rectangular blockhouses are roofed by means of spring arches. The gateway, which is surmounted by the coat of arms of the Order and G. M. Pinto, together with those of the Bailli de Montagnac, was served by a drawbridge and may as a result have had a <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> (this needs to be ascertained by means of a small excavation). The outer faces of the blockhouse are pierced by musketry loopholes. The northern end of the gun platform originally had a parapet with thre...|$|R
50|$|The {{resonator}} {{may be a}} pit {{covered by}} a board, with string attached to it. Kruges describes several other constructions by Venda, e.g., {{the other end of}} a string is tied to a stone <b>dropped</b> into the <b>pit,</b> with string passing through the board covering the pit, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Some pits {{may become}} [...] "bulls". If the last seed of a sowing is <b>dropped</b> in a <b>pit</b> holding 3 seeds, the pit becomes a [...] "bull" [...] {{belonging}} to this player. Also, if {{the last two}} seeds in a sowing are <b>dropped</b> in two <b>pits</b> that hold 2 and 3 seeds, or 3 and 2 seeds, both pits become bulls of this player. Seeds in a bull can never be removed. Every time a sowing ends up with the last seed being dropped in a bull, the player's turn is over. Every time a sowing ends up {{in such a way}} to cause a capture (see above), but the seeds that should be captured are in a bull, the capture does not take place and the turn is over.|$|R

50|$|In 1954 {{work was}} {{completed}} on extending roads 18 to 21 and the covering building on No.2 roundhouse {{to accommodate the}} new AD60 class Garratt locomotives {{at a cost of}} £87,662. This extension was of similar construction to the existing roundhouse. These roads were fitted with service pits 131 ft long, with roads 20 and 21 being fitted with 15 LT capacity <b>drop</b> <b>pits.</b> Four outdoor roads were also lengthened and fitted with pits 112 ft long. To accommodate the length of the AD60 class locos the turntable was lengthened to 105 ft in diameter. The two Northern bays of the coaling stage had a dividing wall installed as well as having the bottom of the two bins raised to accommodate coaling of the Garratt locos. In 1954 one of the radial roads on No.2 turntable was altered into an additional departure road from the depot, this road was provided with a de-ashing pit and was adjacent to the 10000 imp gal water tank and de-ashing pit on the existing departure road from No.2 shed. Unlike the elevated de-ashing pits near the coaling stage these two pits were conventional style pits in between the rails that required to be manually emptied. These two pits were used for the disposal of any ashes that had built up during preparation of the steam locos prior to departing the loco depot to haul a train.|$|R
40|$|Rill erosion {{accounts}} for approximately 70 % {{of the total}} erosion of upland areas in China's Loess Plateau. A laboratory rainfall experiment with deionized water was conducted to examine the process of rill evolution {{and the relationship between}} runoff, rill evolution, and erosion rates for clay loam and loess soils given a fixed slope gradient (10 degrees) and two rainfall intensities (1. 5 and 2. 0 mm min(- 1)). The results show that rills evolved from a series of parallel drop-pit chains along the down-slope direction. Clay loam soil produced rills under a rainfall intensity of 1. 5 mm min(- 1), and loess soil produced rills only under higher rainfall intensity. The temporal change in sediment concentration and erosion rate shows good consistency with the emergence of <b>drop</b> <b>pits</b> and rills. An increase in rainfall intensity had little effect on the sediment concentration and erosion rate for clay loam soil, whereas for loess soil, both increased rapidly and exceeded those of clay loam soil, with the emergence of a rill when the rainfall intensity was higher. Rills have a much greater effect on sediment concentration and erosion rate for loess soil than for clay loam soil. This study indicates that soil texture has a major impact on rill formation; clay loam soil is more subject to rill formation, but the rills formed are generally small and do not substantially increase soil loss. In contrast, the well-developed rills in silt loam soil can result in intensive soil loss, though rills occur infrequently. Basic understanding of these results, causes, and quantification are essential for the prediction and evaluation of soil loss...|$|R

50|$|The station {{building}} and yard dominates {{the south side}} of the main street (Clermont Street). The station building, though very similar to earlier buildings of this group at Mount Morgan (1898) and Archer Park (1899), is distinguished by the semi-circular roof to the central portico which is in other respects similar to its precursors. Flanking pavilions are also distinctive elements having window shades and pedimented treatment with louvred lunettes, repeating the motif established by the central portico. The roadside verandah has cast iron columns and is partially built-in. The platform shade, unlike the carriage shades of the earlier designs has cast iron posts with a curved roof, comparing with South Brisbane (Melbourne Street) and Wallangarra. Accommodation consists of the central vestibule with former booking office and station masters office to the east (now office for maintenance staff and the stock officer) and former refreshment rooms to the west (now station offices). The recent interior fit-outs are generally unsympathetic although it is understood the original ceilings are in situ. Later quarters for refreshment room staff are attached at the west end. The goods shed is a 20 x 60 foot gable roofed timber frame c.g.i. clad building with 2 doors to each side. The double rail weighbridge faces the passenger platform. The houses are contributary and also face the passenger platform from across the yard. The westernmost of the 3 is elevated with pyramidal roof, peripheral verandah and is relatively devoid of ornamentation. The present rolling stock depot includes a recent wagon shed erected over the site of the original engine shed <b>drop</b> <b>pit</b> which is stone and brick lined, and another shed 7 bays long with concrete floor slab and pit to a single siding and surmounting bow string truss roof.|$|R
