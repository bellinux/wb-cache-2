5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
25|$|The {{butternut}} (J.cinerea) is also {{native to}} eastern North America, {{where it is}} currently endangered by an introduced disease, butternut canker, caused by the fungus Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum. Its leaves are 40–60cm long, the fruits are oval, the shell has very tall, very slender ridges, and the kernel is especially <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat.</b> If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E

25|$|The unsized {{oat groats}} {{pass through a}} heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. Oat groats are <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being dehulled if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if they have gone through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{prepared}} {{soul food}} is often <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat,</b> sodium, and starch. Highly {{suited to the}} physically demanding lives of laborers, farmhands and rural lifestyles generally, {{it is now a}} contributing factor to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in a population that has become increasingly more urban and sedentary. As a result, more health-conscious African Americans are using alternative methods of preparation, eschewing trans fats in favor of natural vegetable oils and substituting smoked turkey for fatback and other, cured pork products; limiting the amount of refined sugar in desserts; and emphasizing the consumption of more fruits and vegetables than animal protein. There is some resistance to such changes, however, as they involve deviating from long culinary tradition.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit have {{traditionally}} been fishers and hunters. They still hunt whales (esp. bowhead whale), walrus, caribou, seal, polar bears, muskoxen, birds, and fish and at times other less commonly eaten animals such as the Arctic fox. The typical Inuit diet is high in protein and very <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> – in their traditional diets, Inuit consumed an average of 75% of their daily energy intake from fat. While {{it is not possible}} to cultivate plants for food in the Arctic, the Inuit {{have traditionally}} gathered those that are naturally available. Grasses, tubers, roots, stems, berries, and seaweed (kuanniq or edible seaweed) were collected and preserved depending on the season and the location. There is a vast array of different hunting technologies that the Inuit used to gather their food.|$|E

50|$|Ethanol is not {{the only}} product created during production. By-products also have energy content. Corn is {{typically}} 66% starch and the remaining 33% is not fermented. This unfermented component is called distillers grain, which is <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> and proteins, and makes a good animal feed supplement.|$|R
50|$|Most pre-sliced lunch meats are <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat,</b> nitrates, {{and sodium}} {{than those that}} are sliced to order, as a larger exposed surface {{requires}} stronger preservatives. As a result, processed meats significantly contribute to incidence {{of heart disease and}} diabetes, even more so than red meat.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} {{therapeutic diet}} for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories {{to maintain the}} correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned {{with the introduction of}} effective anticonvulsant drugs. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 [...] ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> such as nuts, cream and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.|$|E
500|$|While {{the flora}} of Grand Teton National Park is {{generally}} healthy, the whitebark pine, {{and to a}} lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the whitebark pine, an invasive species of fungus known as white pine blister rust weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above [...] and produce large seeds that are <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> content and an important food source for various species such as the [...] grizzly bear, red squirrel and Clark's nutcracker. The species {{is considered to be a}} keystone and a foundation species; keystone in that its [...] "ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance" [...] and foundation in that it has a paramount role that [...] "defines ecosystem structure, function, and process". Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in National Parks is to allow nature to take its course, the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.|$|E

The Wahoo (ono) is grilled or sautéed, and the dolphin fish (mahimahi) is usually cut into steaks and fried or grilled. The moonfish (opah) is used for broiling, smoking, or making sashimi.|$|E

Methods A randomly selected sample of 1088 high school students from 20 schools completed surveys about their lunch practices and vending machine purchases. School food policies were assessed by principal and food director surveys. The number of vending machines and their hours of operation were assessed by trained research staff. Results Students at schools with open campus policies during lunchtime {{were significantly more likely}} to eat lunch at a fast food restaurant than students at schools with closed campus policies (0. 7 days/week vs. 0. 2 days/week, p Conclusion School food policies that decrease access to foods <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> and sugars are associated with less frequent purchase of these items <b>in</b> school among <b>high</b> school students. Schools should examine their food-related policies and decrease access to foods that are low <b>in</b> nutrients and <b>high</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> and sugars. </p...|$|R
