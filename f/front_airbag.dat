500|$|Debuting in September 1992 as a 1993 model, the {{refreshed}} LS 400 (designed through 1991) {{was introduced}} {{with more than}} 50 changes, largely in response to customer and dealer requests. The vehicle received larger disc brakes, wheels, and tires, and adjustments {{were made to the}} suspension and power steering systems to improve handling. Stylistic changes included additional body side moldings and a revised grille, along with a greater selection of colors. For the interior, a standard passenger <b>front</b> <b>airbag</b> (first Toyota-built series production car available with passenger <b>front</b> <b>airbag),</b> an external temperature gauge, digital odometer, seat belt pretensioners, and chlorofluorocarbon-free refrigerant were added. In 1992, the Celsior introduced the world first GPS navigation system with voice instructions, supplied by Aisin. By 1994, the LS 400's U.S. base price exceeded , a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle's introduction. Customer demand for the vehicle and shifts in foreign exchange rates contributed to the increase in price. The growing popularity of the LS internationally was an asset to Toyota, as Japan had entered into an economic recession in 1991, that later became what was called the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble or [...] "bubble economy". Production of the first-generation LS ended in September 1994 to make way for production of the second-generation model in October.|$|E

50|$|The Acura RDX is {{the second}} Acura vehicle to feature the Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body {{structure}} {{which is designed to}} absorb energy from a collision. The RDX comes standard with six airbags, including dual front airbags, front side airbags and dual side curtain airbags. The front airbags use a dual-threshold, dual-stage technology that can adjust the timing and speed of each airbag deployment depending on the degree of impact and the driver's or front passenger's seat belt usage. If sensors deem the front passenger too small (less than 65 lb), the <b>front</b> <b>airbag</b> is designed not to deploy. The front passenger's side airbag is also designed to shut off if a child or small-statured adult is leaning into the airbag's deployment path. In the event of a sufficient side impact or roll-over, the side curtain airbag deploys from above the door frames of the affected side, with coverage for both the front and rear occupants on that side, and stays inflated longer than if there were a collision.|$|E
5000|$|Trim {{levels were}} LX, ST, Q and Ti. Engine choices {{consisted}} of the 1.6- and 1.8-litre petrols. Power output was [...] and [...] The four-door was available in four trim levels—an LX with the 1.6, the ST and Ti with the 1.8-litre engine as standard, and a Q version with the 1.8-litre and a sportier level of trim, including a rear spoiler and alloy wheels. In the five-door range there was no LX version. Nissan launched the hatchback model with the ST trim level and a sporty Q version. As such, all hatches were 1.8-litre powered. The base-model LX sedan came with a driver's airbag, air-conditioning, remote locking and power mirrors, although no anti-lock brakes (ABS) or power windows were offered. The ST five-door gained an extra <b>front</b> <b>airbag,</b> whereas the four-door model did not have one as standard. In Ti form, the four-door gained both front airbags, ABS, climate control air-conditioning, alloy wheels and power windows. The Q model {{was similar to the}} Ti four-door, although there were slight discrepancies between the sedan and hatch, with the latter version having an extra air-bag and 15-inch alloy wheels versus the 14-inch alloys on the sedan.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} NHTSA NASS/CDS data {{to examine whether}} {{advancing}} age {{was associated with a}} higher incidence and severity of front airbag-related upper extremity injury (UEI). Using a retrospective cohort design we analyzed weighted data from 1998 – 2007 for. The study population consisted of lap/shoulder belted people over 16 years of age who were driving passenger vehicles with model years 1998 – 2003 and were involved in a frontal crash where their <b>front</b> <b>airbag</b> deployed. Drivers who were ejected, involved in a vehicle rollover, or accompanied by a passenger sitting directly behind them were omitted. The exposure variable was age and the outcome variables were UEI incidence and severity. Associations were adjusted for gender, seat track position, vehicle type, vehicle weight, intrusion, and delta-v. Logistic regressions were performed using SAS survey procedures to account for the complex survey design. Overall, 42 % of drivers sustained an UEI. Advancing age was associated with a higher incidence (p< 0. 0001) and severity (p< 0. 0001) of UEI. Nineteen percent of drivers sustained an UEI related to the airbag. No significant differences in the incidence or severity of airbag-related UEI were found between young drivers and older driver age groups. The degree of severity due to airbag-related UEI was generally minor. The majority of airbag-related UEI appeared to shift slightly from abrasions to contusions with aging. These results indicate that UEI due to depowered airbag deployment is common but not disproportionately high among older drivers, and injury severity is generally minor across all age groups...|$|E
40|$|The Volvo PCR (Pre Crash Recorder) {{is meant}} to {{function}} as a complement to the existing DARR (Digital Accident Research Recorder). The latter is a digital crash pulse recorder that has been installed in Volvo cars since 1994. It records approximately 60 deceleration values in 180 ms upon <b>front</b> <b>airbag</b> deployment. The PCR records 31 selected parameters (table 1) every 500 ms, starting 5 seconds before a crash, and stores them in an electronic memory (EEPROM). This thesis aimed at developing methods and tools for the evaluation of the PCR data. This was done by first explaining and evaluating the parameters thoroughly. A BASIC program was then constructed for the decoding of t he hexadecimal PCR data. This program was also used {{in the construction of the}} fictitious example of an accident investigation that is included in this report. The most important conclusion from this thesis was that:. The PCR data should be used as in-parameters in accident research, e. g. the location of the occupants and their body parts in the collision moment, the vehicle speed or the status and function of the vehicle safety systems.. The extracted PCR data should be presented in a clear way, possibly in an excel chart. This can easily be achieved by using a program like the one developed in this thesis.. It is recommendable that the parameters are evaluated in small groups or pairs. For example could the steering wheel angle be plotted with the actual yaw rate and the active-safety system parameters with the accelerations and rotations (roll and yaw) of the car.. When recreating the course of an accident it is suitable to make simple figures from every sampling moment to clarify the big picture. For the future it is recommended to add more parameters to the recordings and develop methods [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{accuracy}} of pre-hospital crash scene details and crash victim assessment {{has important implications}} for initial trauma care assessment and management. Similarly, it is known to influence physician perception of crash victim injury severity. The goal of this feasibility study was to examine paramedic accuracy in predicting crash victim injury profile, disability outcome at hospital discharge, and reporting vehicle damage with other crash variables. Methods: This prospective case series study was undertaken at a Southern California, Level I trauma center certified by the American College of Surgeons. Paramedics transporting crash injured motor vehicle occupants to our emergency department (ED) /trauma center were surveyed. We abstracted ED and in-patient records of injured vehicle occupants. Vehicle and crash scene data were obtained from a professional crash reconstruction, which included the assessment of deformation, crash forces, change in velocity, and the source of each injury. Results: We used survey, injury, and crash reconstruction data from 22 collision cases in the final analysis. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was five (range 1 - 24). No enrolled patients died, and none were severely disabled at the time of discharge from the hospital. The paramedic crash injury severity predictions were sensitive for an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) of 2 - 4. Paramedics often agreed with the crash reconstruction on restraint use, ejection, and other fatalities at the scene, and had lower levels of agreement for <b>front</b> <b>airbag</b> deployment, steering wheel damage, and window/windshield impact. Paramedics had 80 % accuracy in predicting any disability at the time of hospital discharge. Conclusion: Paramedic prediction of injury profile was sensitive, and prediction of disability outcome at discharge was accurate when compared to discharge diagnosis. Their reporting of vehicle specific crash variables was less accurate. Further study should be undertaken to assess the benefits of crash biomechanics education for paramedics and other pre-hospital care providers. [WestJEM. 2009; 10 : 62 - 67. ...|$|E
