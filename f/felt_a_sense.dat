The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E

Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members.

5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E

500|$|For A Dramatic Turn of Events, Dream Theater {{underwent}} a self-proclaimed musical change, reevaluating and restructuring themselves. The album has drawn stylistic comparisons {{to two of}} the band's past albums, Images and Words (1992) and [...] (1999). Many songs on the album were written with a specific purpose in mind as Petrucci, one of the album's primary composers, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of responsibility to fans following Portnoy's departure. The album's title was derived from its recurring lyrical themes of dramatic changes in history that have affected people's lives, including contemporary uprisings such as the Libyan Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Scion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of Christian {{responsibility}} that was expressed in her letters. She considered it her duty {{to help improve}} the lives of newly emancipated blacks and detailed her efforts to establish a school and church in Mandarin toward these ends. Parts of the book relate the lives of local African-Americans and the customs of their society. Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of [...] "excessive" [...] heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter. Her audience comprises relatives, friends, and strangers in New England who ask her advice about whether or not to move to Florida, which at the time was still mostly wilderness. Although it is a minor work in Stowe's oeuvre, Palmetto Leaves {{was one of the first}} travel guides written about Florida and stimulated Florida's first boom of tourism and residential development in the 1880s.|$|E
500|$|After a 7–6–1 {{season in}} 1962, Modell fired Brown and offered the head {{coaching}} job to Collier. Collier told Modell he first needed {{the blessing of}} his wife and of Brown, to whom he still <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of loyalty. He called Brown, who told him he had to take the job because he had a family to support. Collier accepted a three-year contract that would pay him $35,000 a year (about $ in [...] dollars). In contrast with Brown, Collier was almost universally liked by players and other coaches. He was soft-spoken, which was unusual for a head coach, but he earned the respect of the team with his extensive knowledge and his willingness to give players more freedom than Brown ever did. [...] One significant difference was his approach to play-calling. [...] Like Brown, Collier served as his own play-caller. [...] However, he let Frank Ryan, who replaced Plum as the team's starting quarterback in 1963, change plays at the line of scrimmage and allowed more flexibility in pass routes and blocking schemes.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching?, praised the {{decision}} to include a multiple-week mystery. He thought that spreading the case out allowed the episode {{to focus on the}} main story arc and Logan's subplot as well as allow the main mystery time to finish. He was also complimentary towards the Logan–Heather plotline, lauding Goglia's performance; he also stated that the episode gave him renewed interest in the Dean O'Dell case. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, rated the episode a 7.7 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "good". He was highly critical of the subplot involving Logan and Heather, stating that it [...] "rode the line of insufferable". While opining that it had some good comedic moments, he thought {{that the majority of the}} subplot involved heavy use of clichés. However, he was more mixed to positive towards the case-of-the-week. The reviewer <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of anticipation that this storyline did not resolve itself in the episode: [...] "it's hard not to be anxious to see where this is going." ...|$|E
500|$|After Halo 3, {{development}} studio Bungie {{created an}} internal team {{to work on}} Peter Jackson's planned Halo game, Halo Chronicles. Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing {{all the way to the}} end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E

500|$|Saunders {{went to work}} in {{the logging}} {{industry}} in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire {{to do something about the}} Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. [...] "They can take all the blood they want from me," [...] Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, [...] "and they'll never find out what I am– least of all an Aborigine– bloody stupid!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} vocals for Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid project Sun City in August 1985, Bono made {{an additional}} {{contribution to the}} album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition" [...] and {{felt as if they}} [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to Sun City. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock's roots and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained, [...] "I used to think that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt {{the time had come to}} write words that meant something, out of my experience." [...] Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track [...] "In a Lifetime".|$|E

CDJournal called the album a [...] "must listen disc", praising the increased skill of the [...] "literary world" [...] of Yamaguchi's lyrics, and the album's [...] "fantasy-like nostalgia". They described [...] "Monochrome Tokyo" [...] as an [...] "impressive rock number created by synthesizer and bass guitar riffs", praising the band's skill at removing musical elements as well as Yamaguchi's [...] "emotionally sung" [...] and [...] "sexy" [...] vocals. For [...] "Antares to Hari", the reviewers felt that a [...] "stylish jazz funk aroma" [...] was created by a [...] "relaxed" [...] bass line and guitar cutting, and praised the light atmosphere created by the deep synths, while [...] "Ryūsen"'s [...] "comfortable" [...] acoustic guitar [...] "paints a dramatic and grand scene." [...] They {{felt that the}} song managed to develop and increase in [...] "temperature" [...] without becoming noisy, and pointed to this as well as the [...] "abstract" [...] lyric [...] as creating a [...] "mysterious atmosphere". The reviewers likened [...] "Kamen to Machi" [...] to Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra, and <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of tension created by Yamaguchi's fast-tempo vocals and the changing background instrumental. They believed that the album's closing song [...] "Document" [...] was a condensation of the album's taste, and that the final lyric [...] set to a [...] "relaxed and hopeful sound" [...] had a powerfully lingering impression.|$|E
