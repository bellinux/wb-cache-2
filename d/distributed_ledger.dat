40|$|We {{introduce}} blockchains and <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> {{and describe}} their potential applications to money and banking. The analysis compares {{public and private}} ledgers and outlines the suitability of various types of ledgers for different purposes. Furthermore, a few historical prototypes of blockchains and <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> are presented, and results of their hard forking are illustrated. Next, some potential applications of <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> to trading, clearing and settlement, payments, trade finance, etc. are outlined. Monetary circuits are argued to be natural applications for blockchains. Finally, the role of digital currencies in modern society is articulated and various forms of digital cash, such as central bank issued electronic cash, bank money, bitcoin and P 2 P money, are compared and contrasted. Keywords: blockchains, <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers,</b> digital currencies, modern monetary circuit; credit creation banking; interconnected banking network.

40|$|The web was {{originally}} conceived as decentralized and universal, but during its popularization, its big value {{was built on}} centralized servers and nonuniversal access.

The authors believe that the marriage between <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> and linked data can provide this functionality and unlock the web's true potential.

5000|$|A {{blockchain}} - originally {{block chain}} - is a continuously {{growing list of}} records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Functionally, a blockchain can serve as [...] "an open, <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way." [...] For use as a <b>distributed</b> <b>ledger</b> a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority.|$|E

30|$|Financial {{intermediaries}} enable {{strangers to}} transact because a state-backed trusted institution guaranteed transactions. Most money in global financial systems is actually credit extended by these institutions, not currency printed by governments. Periodic credit crises undermine confidence in these trusted institutions, {{as does the}} abuse of seignorage—the return to the issuer (e.g., a government) from the right to create money—typically by over-inflating a currency. A host of tokens using <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers</b> are competing to institutionalize ways of creating trust among strangers that {{does not depend on}} trusted intermediaries.|$|R
40|$|In {{this general}} {{overview}} article intended for non-experts, I define blockchain technology {{and some of}} the key concepts, and then I elaborate four specific applications that highlight the potential economic benefits of digital ledgers. These applications are digital asset registries, blockchains as leapfrog technology for global financial inclusion, long-tail personalized economic services, and net settlement payment channels. I also highlight key challenges that offset the potential economic benefits of blockchain <b>distributed</b> <b>ledgers,</b> while arguing that the benefits would outweigh the potential risks. The overarching theme is that an increasing amount of everyday operations involving money, assets, and documents could start to be conducted via blockchain-based <b>distributed</b> network <b>ledgers</b> with cryptographic security, and at more granular levels of detail. One economic implication of widespread blockchain adoption is that the institutional structure of society could shift to one that is computationally-based and thus has a diminished need for human-operated brick-and-mortar institutions...|$|R
