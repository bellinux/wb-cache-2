The personalization of <b>intelligent</b> <b>interactive</b> systems has become reality. Researchers are working on fusing adaptivity and learning in interac-tive systems. Intelligent recommender systems, intelligent tutoring systems, <b>intelligent</b> web-shops, <b>intelligent</b> <b>interactive</b> TV, <b>intelligent</b> mobile services, affective systems and narrative environments constitute typical <b>intelligent</b> <b>interactive</b> systems. However, the list of <b>intelligent</b> <b>interactive</b> systems is not exhausted to the aforementioned applications, as research and developments in the area expand to many more applications.

This class of problems are those that can be solved by systems based on <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Interactive</b> Environments. We first introduce the notion of <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Interactive</b> Environments, then we introduce the Jam Session language, which is a compact and simple to use conceptual tool to build systems based on the notion of <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Interactive</b> Environments. Finally, we convey our view that such solutions can be particularly effective for those systems which shall address the needs of a wide spectrum of diverse users – as occurs, for example, in the case of Electronic Government systems. In order to convey more clearly this view, we present a small prototype of a system to address an issue related to cross-borders Electronic Government, namely, the issuing of visas to enter a country for specific purposes. ...|$|R

Several methods are proposed to achieve the conception of <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Interactive</b> Multimedia. Digital Drawing Block is the interactive multimedia with the initial intention of multimedia creator and it forms an interaction with spectator.

Moreover, captured features will be sent to the machine learning for analyzing. Proposed user models are to assist the machine learning to evaluate the most appropriate category of human behaviour which matches the spectator actual intention.

A key issue is how to train such skilled behaviour? Recent changes to breast imaging has seen the introduction of high resolution digital imaging which facilitates <b>intelligent</b> <b>interactive</b> training. It has also enabled potential computer aided detection of abnormalities. However, this also tends to increase false positive cancer detections.
