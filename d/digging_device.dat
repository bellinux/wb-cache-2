25|$|On June 2, 2003, the European Space Agency's Mars Express set {{off from}} Baikonur Cosmodrome to Mars. The Mars Express craft {{consists}} of the Mars Express Orbiter and the stationary lander Beagle 2. The lander carried a <b>digging</b> <b>device</b> and the smallest mass spectrometer created to date, {{as well as a}} range of other devices, on a robotic arm in order to accurately analyze soil beneath the dusty surface to look for biosignatures and biomolecules.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{first generation}} human interface control panel is described {{which will be}} used to control SKITTER, a three-legged lunar walking machine. Under development at Georgia Tech, SKITTER will be a multi-purpose, un-manned vehicle capable of preparing a site for the proposed lunar base in advance of the arrival of men. This walking machine will be able to accept modular special purpose tools, such as a crane, a core sampling drill, and a <b>digging</b> <b>device,</b> among others. The project was concerned with the design of a human interface which could be used, from earth, to control the movements of SKITTER on the lunar surface. Preliminary inquiries were also made into necessary modifications required to adapt the panel to both a shirt-sleeve lunar environment and to a mobile unit which could be used by a man in a space suit at a lunar work site...|$|E
40|$|High {{launch costs}} and mission {{requirements}} drive {{the need for}} low mass excavators with mobility platforms, which in turn have little traction and excavation reaction capacity in low gravity environments. This presents the need for precursor and long term future missions with low mass robotic mining technology to perform In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) tasks. This paper discusses a series of experiments that investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} percussive <b>digging</b> <b>device</b> to reduce excavation loads and thereby the mass of the excavator itself. A percussive mechanism and 30 " wide pivoting bucket were attached {{at the end of the}} arm simulating a basic backhoe with a percussion direction tangent to the direction of movement. Impact energies from 13. 6 J to 30. 5 J and frequencies from 0 BPM to 700 BPM were investigated. A reduction in excavation force of as much as 50 % was achieved in this experimental investigation...|$|E
50|$|In {{photos of}} early {{missions}} to defuse unexploded bombs, {{the men are}} not wearing any protective gear. In fact, they are often shirtless {{to cope with the}} heat generated by the manual labor of <b>digging</b> around the <b>devices</b> before they could be defused. Basically, the individual defusing the bomb succeeded - or failed with fatal results.|$|R
40|$|This course allows COE/ELE {{graduates}} {{to acquire the}} technical skills that are required to match a specific industry-related need. In particular, it exposes students to the techniques, which can improve their chances of gaining employment in jobs aligned with the considered need. This exposure is reinforced by an extensive hands-on experience that is brought into classroom through small-scale projects pertaining to problems inspired from the identified need. This year, the COE application course will <b>dig</b> into mobile <b>device</b> programming. More specifically, the main emphasis will {{be placed on the}} development of mobile applications that run on Android mobile platforms...|$|R
40|$|Change in {{the work}} {{function}} (WF) of the gate electrode material caused by the contact with Hf-based high-k gate dielectrics was investigated {{by means of the}} flat-band voltage (Vfb) shift in capacitance-voltage curves, and the interface dipole, which modifies the WF, was characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We observed a negative Vfb shift and corresponding interface dipole, which suggest the formation of oxygen vacancy (VO) in the Hf-based oxides. In contrast, we observed an opposite (positive) Vfb shift and interface dipole when Au electrodes were formed on cleaned Hf-based dielectrics. This indicates that Auâ€“Hf bond hybridization at the Au/HfSiON interface also causes effective WF modulation, as theoretically predicted by Shiraishi et al. (Tech. - <b>Dig.</b> Int. Electron <b>Devices</b> Meet. 2005, 43) ...|$|R

This presents the need for precursor and long term future missions with low mass robotic mining technology to perform In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) tasks. This paper discusses a series of experiments that investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} percussive <b>digging</b> <b>device</b> to reduce excavation loads and thereby the mass of the excavator itself. The goal of percussive excavation is to fluidize dry regolith in front of {{the leading edge of the}} tool by mechanically separating the microscopic interlocking grains resulting in a reduced force needed to shear the soil. There are several variables involved with this technique; this experiment varied: Impact energy, frequency, and excavation speed and held constant: impact direction, depth of cut, angle of tool, and soil bulk density. The test apparatus consisted of an aluminum truss bridge with a central pivoting arm. Attached to the arm was a winch with a load cell in line that recorded the tension in the cable and therefore the excavation load. The arm could be adjusted for excavation depth which was recorded along with the arm angle relative to the bridge. A percussive mechanism and 30 " wide pivoting bucket were attached at the end of the arm simulating a basic backhoe with a percussion direction tangent to the direction of. movement. Internally the mechanism used a set of die springs and barrel cam to produce the percussive blow. By changing the springs and the speed of the motor the impact energy and frequency of percussion could be varied independently. Impact energies from 11. 2 J to 30. 5 J and frequencies from 0 BPM to 700 BPM were investigated. A reduction in excavation force of as much as 51 % was achieved in this experimental investigation. Smaller percussive digging implements, tested by others, have achieved a reduction of as much as 72 %. This paper will examine the effects of impact energy, frequency, scaling and their effect on excavation forces in a dry granular material such as lunar regolith. The past several years have shown an increasing interest in mining space resources both for exploration and commercial enterprises. This work studied the benefits and risks of percussive excavation and prelimin~ry results indicate that this technique may become an enabling technology for extra-terrestrial excavation of regolith and ice...|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} led to {{the first}} prototype, built in 1968. The device consisted of a cylindrical shell filled with solid propellant, {{with a number of}} de Laval nozzles installed in the nose cone. The rocket was positioned nose down and the propellant ignited; hot gases escaped through the nozzles at supersonic speeds. Nozzles aimed downwards were responsible for demolition of the ground underneath the rocket; the next series of nozzles, aimed sideways, expanded the drilled well. Gas escaped between the device's shell and the walls of the well at speeds of up to 100 m/s, carrying along chunks of pulverized rock up to 15 cm across. In the process, the gas significantly cooled down through contact with the shaft's walls. Most of the energy contained in the propellant (5 to 100 thousand hp) was spent on the actual <b>digging,</b> while the <b>device</b> lowered itself deeper into the well under its own weight. Tsiferov's device was capable of drilling the well tens of metres deep and 250-1000 mm in diameter, {{depending on the type of}} soil. Experiments have demonstrated that the device is able to drill holes not only in regular soil, but through solid rock, permafrost, ice and aquifers.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{techniques}} for the measurements of very small strain stiffness parameters of coarse-grained materials include: (a) static tests using local strain transducers like LDTs and (b) wave propagation measurements performed using bender elements, shear plates, and so on. The former method has been employed for most kinds of soil, while {{the use of}} wave propagation methods has been restricted to small specimens of sand and clay. At the University of Naples Federico II (<b>DIG),</b> a simple <b>device</b> to generate and monitor compressional and shear waves {{has been designed to}} be used in large-scale triaxial apparatuses. The testing device was first used on densely compacted gravel specimens in a large triaxial apparatus in Naples and, after some further improvements, also in another large triaxial cell in Tokyo. In the tests carried out in Tokyo, dynamic and static measurements were performed simultaneously on the single gravel specimens. In this paper, the details of the new system are presented and the results are discussed. The comparison between stiffness moduli evaluated by dynamic and static measurements shows that density, stress state, and strain history effects are similar, but that the dynamically measured stiffness values are consistently larger, about two times, than the statically determined ones. Since the stiffness of gravels has proven to be strain rate independent, possible reasons for this difference are addressed...|$|R
40|$|Third-party {{contact with}} {{pipelines}} (typically caused by {{contact with a}} <b>digging</b> or drilling <b>device)</b> can result in mechanical damage to the pipe, in addition to coating damage that can initiate corrosion. Because this type of damage often goes unreported {{and can lead to}} eventual catastrophic failure of the pipe, a reliable, cost-effective method is needed for monitoring and reporting third-party contact events. The impressed alternating cycle current (IACC) pipeline monitoring method consists of impressing electrical signals on the pipe by generating a time-varying voltage between the pipe and the soil at periodic locations where pipeline access is available. The signal voltage between the pipe and ground is monitored continuously at receiving stations located some distance away. Third-party contact to the pipe that breaks through the coating changes the signal received at the receiving stations. In this project, the IACC monitoring method is being developed, tested, and demonstrated. Work performed to date includes (1) a technology assessment, (2) development of an IACC model to predict performance and assist with selection of signal operating parameters, (3) Investigation of potential interactions with cathodic protection systems, and (4) experimental measurements on buried pipe at a test site as well as on an operating pipeline. Initial results show that simulated contact can be detected. Future work will involve further refinement of the method and testing on operating pipelines...|$|R

Because this type of damage often goes unreported {{and can lead to}} eventual catastrophic failure of the pipe, a reliable, cost-effective method is needed for monitoring the pipeline and reporting third-party contact events. The impressed alternating cycle current (IACC) pipeline monitoring method developed by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) consists of impressing electrical signals on the pipe by generating a time-varying voltage between the pipe and the soil. The signal voltage between the pipe and ground is monitored continuously at receiving stations located some distance away. Third-party contact to the pipe that breaks through the coating (thus resulting in a signal path to ground) changes the signal received at the receiving stations. The IACC method was shown to be a viable method {{that can be used to}} continuously monitor pipelines for third-party contact. Electrical connections to the pipeline can be made through existing cathodic protection (CP) test points without the need to dig up the pipe. The instrumentation is relatively simple, consisting of (1) a transmitting station with a frequency-stable oscillator and amplifier and (2) a receiving station with a filter, lock-in amplifier, frequency-stable oscillator, and remote reporting device (e. g. cell phone system). Maximum distances between the transmitting and receiving stations are approximately 1. 61 km (1 mile), although the length of pipeline monitored can be twice this using a single transmitter and one receiver on each side (since the signal travels in both directions). Certain conditions such as poor pipeline coatings or strong induced 60 -Hz signals on the pipeline can degrade IACC performance, so localized testing should be performed to determine the suitability for an IACC installation at a given location. The method can be used with pipelines having active CP systems in place without causing interference with operation of the CP system. The most appropriate use of IACC is monitoring of localized high-consequence areas where there is a significant risk of third-party contact (e. g. construction activity). The method also lends itself to temporary, low-cost installation where there is a short-term need for monitoring...|$|R
