5|$|Dense {{vegetation}} (such as that {{of tropical}} rainforests) and urban habitats are not ideal {{for the establishment of}} the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by <b>economic</b> <b>exploitation</b> and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.|$|E
5|$|The insect {{was once}} {{commonly}} {{found throughout the}} Palearctic and was recognised across Eurasia, from France and England to China, but it was mainly in Central Europe where it was common enough to make its industrial use economically viable. Excessive <b>economic</b> <b>exploitation</b> {{as well as the}} shrinking and degradation of its habitat have made the Polish cochineal a rare species. In 1994, it was included in the Ukrainian Red Book of endangered species. In Poland, where it was still common in the 1960s, there is insufficient data to determine its conservation status, and no protective measures are in place.|$|E

The issues are those directly focused on <b>economic</b> activities: <b>exploitation</b> in deep water (P 7), securing vital maritime flows (P 18), bio-reducing the footprint of human activities (P 11), marine bio-economics (P 12) and, lagging far behind, sustainable tourism (P 14), the only issue with a score of “not important” reaching 20  %.|$|R
5000|$|Critics of {{capitalism}} view {{the system as}} inherently exploitative. In an <b>economic</b> sense, <b>exploitation</b> is often related to the expropriation of labor for profit and based on Marx's version of the labor theory of value. The labor theory of value was supported by classical economists like David Ricardo and Adam Smith who believed that [...] "the value of a commodity depends on the relative quantity of labor which is necessary for its production." ...|$|R

5000|$|Toxic colonialism, {{defined as}} {{the process by which}} “underdeveloped states are used as {{inexpensive}} alternatives for the export or disposal of hazardous waste pollution by developed states,” is the core critique against the global waste trade. Toxic colonialism represents the neocolonial policy which continues to maintain global inequality today through unfair trade systems. Toxic colonialism uses the term colonialism because “the characteristics of colonialism, involving <b>economic</b> dependence, <b>exploitation</b> of labour, and cultural inequality are intimately associated within the new realm of toxic waste colonialism.” ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{national}} and international efforts to end child labor, children continue working throughout the world. On one hand, governments try to regulate children’s work by limiting the types of work they can perform and directly stopping them from working. On the other hand, children need to work due to their economic situations, and they find meaning in their work. Although regulation is necessary {{to protect children from}} <b>economic</b> <b>exploitations,</b> it also separates childhood from working. Such a view of children also assumes them as passive objects of protection, rather than active agents of their own lives. Carrying this particular notion of childhood, government regulation may impose unintended, negative effects on children’s work conditions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand why government regulations have been ineffective by examining the conflict between the interest of child workers and that of the government. It focuses the particular cases of child salvagers and street children in the Philippines. Through the examination of published materials, as well as the interviews with child workers and NGO staff, this study reveals that government regulation affects children negatively from children’s viewpoints. It also discloses that children actively make decisions and adopt coping strategies to deal with their situations at work...|$|R

The main sources of governance are the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Arctic Council (AC), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the domestic legislation of the Russian Federation. In combination, they cover territorial claims, <b>economic</b> <b>exploitation,</b> technical shipping requirements, environmental protection, and search and rescue responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|Postcolonialism or postcolonial {{studies is}} an {{academic}} discipline that analyzes, explains, and {{responds to the}} cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Postcolonialism speaks about the human consequences of external control and <b>economic</b> <b>exploitation</b> of native people and their lands. Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyze the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by examining the functional relations {{of social and political}} power that sustain colonialism and neocolonialism—the imperial regime's depictions (social, political, cultural) of the colonizer and of the colonized.|$|E

Sexual inequality is [...] "an oppression that goes back beyond recorded history to the animal kingdom itself": in this sense, it has been universal and inevitable, but the cultural and technological preconditions now exist that make its elimination possible and perhaps necessary for human survival.|$|R

While in brigade status, the unit participated in the murder of Jewish civilians alongside Einsatzkommando 9 of Einsatzgruppe B. Upon formation, the division operated in the Vitebsk-Polotsk region of the north-western Belarus. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, <b>economic</b> <b>exploitation</b> and combatting guerillas (partisans) in Werhmacht's rear areas.|$|E
25|$|The third great wave of {{domestic}} migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952–53.

Puerto Rican women confronted <b>economic</b> <b>exploitation,</b> discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in the job market. The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers. By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island.|$|E
