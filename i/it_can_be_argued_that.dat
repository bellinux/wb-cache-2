5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> private charity is {{insufficient}} because {{the benefits from}} it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed {{by the sight of}} poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E
50|$|Case hardening: <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> magistrates <b>are</b> {{susceptible}} to finding over time that circumstances are not shocking and passing sentences becomes {{less of a}} big issue so leading to a more cynical approach.|$|R
50|$|There's nothing {{inherently}} {{wrong with}} the latter {{way of thinking about}} franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.|$|R
5000|$|Language A: {{language}} and literature is a new course for first examinations 2013, intended to replace the Language A2 course in group 2. [...] The main aim of the course is to [...] "encourage students to question the meaning generated by {{language and}} texts, which, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> <b>is</b> rarely straightforward and unambiguous". The course is available at both Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL). The course is currently only available in 17 languages.|$|R
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

50|$|In 1856, Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson formed Smith & Wesson to {{manufacture}} revolvers. Smith & Wesson {{has gone on}} to become the largest and, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> the most famous gun manufacturer in the world. The company's headquarters remains in Springfield and as of 2011, employs over 1200 workers.|$|R
40|$|The school {{improvement}} movement, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> has <b>been</b> {{responsible for the}} drift away from inner-city schools to those perceived as higher achieving {{in that they are}} able to produce, with a given population, better results at GCSE, which are quite crudely described as percentage pass rates and published in respectable news...|$|R
50|$|As Hare points out, {{the same}} type of {{argument}} is often used in the philosophy of time to support theories such as presentism. Of course, we can say that A is happening on today's date. But, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> this misses the fact that A is simply happening (right now), not relative to anything.|$|R
25|$|Increasingly, the Governor-General {{represents}} New Zealand {{abroad and}} is accorded the same respect and privileges {{of a head}} of state. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the de facto head of state is the Governor-General while the de jure head of state remains the Sovereign.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{presence}} of Robert Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the Kardashian family. While Kardashian's ex-wife Kris Jenner was already married to former Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner (then known as Bruce) {{at the time of}} the trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> superheroes, the uniquely American {{contribution}} to comic books, owe their origin to New York, {{despite the fact}} that the first superhero, Superman, was created by two artists from Cleveland, Ohio. Even when not based explicitly in New York, superhero stories often make use of recognizable stand-ins for the city, such as Metropolis or Gotham City (Gotham being a common nickname for New York). The form and narrative conventions of superhero stories frequently dictate New York-sized cities as the settings, even generically.|$|E
30|$|Changing {{the format}} of case-based discussions as {{described}} by Chew [3] and allowing preparation of cases beforehand certainly seems to be better received. In addition, the author reports that trainees appeared more engaged {{and the number of}} teaching cases could be increased, maximising the teacher’s efforts—although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> of course that more preparation time may initially be needed.|$|R
500|$|Assemblies did not {{consist of}} the whole Roman people (...) , not only were there {{restrictions}} on the vote in that only adult male citizens were permitted to participate. Until the Social War around 90BC, foreigners were prohibited from voting as well. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> however, that the Assembly was more a representative group of Romans rather than a simple direct democracy.|$|R
5000|$|The songs, which {{relate to}} the {{contemporary}} world of Tennyson's time, are {{in contrast to the}} main narrative, which is male-oriented, with a mock-mediaeval setting. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> Tennyson balanced the anti-feminist message of the men's narrative with the practical progressiveness displayed in the women's songs. [...] Other critics conclude that the final message of the narrative is plain and anti-feminist.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{within this}} {{backdrop}} of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions {{would be far}} more pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images can clearly be classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{movement in}} modern Persian literature {{centered on the}} question of modernization and Westernization and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and Taqi Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.|$|E
25|$|Mycorrhizas {{from the}} Miocene exhibit a {{vesicular}} morphology closely resembling that of present Glomerales. This conserved morphology {{may reflect the}} ready availability of nutrients provided by the plant hosts in both modern and Miocene mutualisms. However, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the efficacy of signaling processes {{is likely to have}} evolved since the Miocene, and this can not be detected in the fossil record. A finetuning of the signaling processes would improve coordination and nutrient exchange between symbionts while increasing the fitness of both the fungi and the plant symbionts.|$|E
50|$|This theorem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{viewed as}} an {{immediate}} corollary of the closed graph theorem, as self-adjoint operators <b>are</b> closed. Alternatively, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> using the uniform boundedness principle. One relies on the symmetric assumption, therefore the inner product structure, in proving the theorem. Also crucial {{is the fact that}} the given operator A is defined everywhere (and, in turn, the completeness of Hilbert spaces).|$|R

25|$|Some Japanese {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion {{in the southern}} portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion {{in order to justify}} its conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Bell {{did for the}} {{telephone}} what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Although {{not the first to}} experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Bell invented {{the telephone}} industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an IEEE Milestone.|$|E
50|$|Without {{appropriate}} jobs, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> using {{rational choice}} theory that welfare recipients {{would make the}} decision to do what is economically advantageous to them, which often means not taking low-paid work that would require expensive childcare and lengthy commutes. This would explain dependence on welfare over work. However, a large proportion of welfare recipients are also in some form of work, which casts doubt on this viewpoint.|$|R
40|$|Eighteenth-century garden {{design has}} been {{interpreted}} in terms of legitimation, a tool with which elites attempted to maintain power and authority over marginalized groups. But most acts of aesthetic landscaping, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> <b>were</b> primarily directed not towards "the poor" but to rival groups within the propertied. Similarly, any opposition to the dominant ideology expressed {{in the design of}} landscape was mainly mounted by disaffected groups within the ranks of the franchised. In so far as the poor in this period inscribed their mark upon the land, it was in acts of vandalism or reappropriation which have left little direct trace in the archaeological record...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{the effects}} of expansionary {{monetary}} policy <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> described as higher stock prices (again leading to more funds) lower the costs of capital (financing with stocks instead of bonds makes investment cheaper), and will rise both demand and aggregate output. In other words:↑ M → ↑ stock price → ↓ c → ↑ I → ↑ Y. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> by the same logic that the opposite holds for contractionary monetary policy.|$|R
25|$|The Founding of Lesbos: twentyone hexameters were {{quoted by}} Parthenius {{under the title}} Lesbou ktisis. The author's name was not given but modern {{scholars}} attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Peisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning {{at the hands of}} the Argives. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with Argonautica, epic material has been used unconventionally as a window into the female psyche.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's {{treatment}} of Kilkenny and Clonmel {{is in contrast}} to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The change in attitude {{on the part of the}} Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this meant no quarter would be given; thus <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Cromwell's attitude had not changed.|$|E
25|$|In {{developed}} countries with high utility cycling levels, utility cyclists tend to undertake relatively short journeys. According to Irish 1996 Census data, over 55% of cycling workers travelled 3miles (4.8km) or less, 27% 5miles (8km) or less and only 17% travelled more than 5miles {{in their daily}} commute. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> factors that directly influence trip length or journey time {{are among the most}} important in making cycling a competitive transport mode. Car ownership rates can also be influential. In New York City, {{more than half of all}} households do not own a car (the figure is even higher in Manhattan, over 75%), and walk/bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city.|$|E

Dragging Canoe was opposed to selling the lands along the Holston and Watauga and Nolichucky rivers of East Tennessee. He was opposed to {{the sale of the}} Long Island of the Holston. He was opposed to the sale of the lands that were the East Tennessee settlements.|$|R
50|$|Some {{deregulation}} proponents {{are less}} opposed to airport taxi regulation than to regulation of other taxi services. They {{argue that if}} an airport regulates prices for taxis in its taxi queues, such regulation has fewer disadvantages than citywide regulation. An airport may determine prices or organize different queues for taxi services of different qualities and prices. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> whether rules set by the owner of an airport are regulation or just a business model.|$|R
5000|$|Unusually for manuscripts of this era, the Trent Codices are small: at {{approximately}} 9 x 12 inches (20 x 30 cm) {{they are the}} equivalent of a 15th-century [...] "miniature score". Since their small size and numerous errors would make singing from them difficult or impossible, they may have been used as a source from which performance copies were made. On the other hand, they are quite large enough to be sung from with one person on each part (which, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> <b>was</b> the norm for most of the 15th century). For some pieces, voice parts were even divided between two different gatherings ('booklets'), which would make possible a performance by two groups of singers.|$|R
