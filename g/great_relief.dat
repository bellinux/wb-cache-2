5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his <b>great</b> <b>relief,</b> the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} {{treatment}} by Bradman, Larwood {{was successful in}} 1930, rising to fourth place in the national bowling averages (99 wickets at 16.38). He also batted well on occasions, including a not-out century against Northamptonshire. He was not selected for the 1930–31 tour of South Africa, {{and for the next}} two years he concentrated mainly on domestic cricket. He made one Test appearance in 1931, against New Zealand, in a rain-ruined game in which he neither batted nor bowled. He headed the domestic bowling averages in 1931 and 1932, in the latter year with 162 wickets at 12.86, the best seasonal figures of his career. However, because of his poor Test record in 1930, Larwood thought his chances of selection for the 1932–33 tour to Australia were slim. The 1932 Test trial was limited to half a day's play, during which Larwood bowled 15 overs for a single wicket. Nevertheless, to his <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> he was selected for the tour, as was Voce, who had been England's most successful bowler during the South African tour of 1930–31.|$|E

25|$|The Persians {{effectively}} {{entered into}} conflict with the Ottoman Empire on five occasions in the Ottoman–Persian Wars, weakening the Ottoman Empire considerably every time, and effectively opening a second front when the Ottoman Empire was in conflict in Europe, to the rejoicing of Habsburg Europe. It was a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> for the Habsburgs, and appeared as {{the realization of the}} old Habsburg–Persian alliance stratagem.|$|E
25|$|Marie Louise was not {{considered}} attractive, as her features were heavy {{and her face was}} dominated by a large nose. She was however very charming, and greeted those of all ranks with natural friendliness and sincere concern for their well being. They had two children before his untimely death by drowning on 14 July 1711, the youngest of whom was born after his death. William Charles Henry Friso's birth was met with <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> by the Frisians, and he automatically inherited the title Prince of Orange.|$|E

25|$|The {{last months}} of {{pregnancy}} of Aspasia {{are surrounded by}} intrigue. In the case that she gave birth a boy (who would be named Philip, {{as the father of}} Alexander the Great), rumours soon assured that she was determined to place him on the throne after his birth. True or not, this possibility worried the Greek royal family, whose fears about the birth of a male child were exploited by the Venizelists to revive the succession crisis. The birth of a girl, on 25 March 1921 was a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> for the dynasty and both King Constantine I and his mother Queen Dowager Olga agreed to be the godparents of the newborn.|$|E
25|$|One night, Melancholia passes {{closely as}} {{predicted}} by the scientists, to <b>great</b> <b>relief.</b> The next day, however, Claire realizes when using a homemade device recommended by John that Melancholia is circling back as {{predicted by the}} Internet article. She begins to panic, looking for John and finding him dead in the black horse’s stable, having poisoned himself. Claire releases the horse. Justine, appearing to recover, had a bath, stating that she is now all clean. A hailstorm starts. Claire tries to escape the estate with her son but the golf cart she is riding shuts down as she attempts to cross the same bridge as Justine did earlier. Returned to the lodge, Claire begins to accept the inevitable and later suggests getting together on the terrace with wine and music. Justine dismisses her idea with brutal honesty.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} Alexandra on 25 March 1921 caused a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> to the Royal Family: {{under the terms}} of the Salic law (which prevailed in Greece), the newborn cannot claim the crown and she was {{unlikely}} to be used to undermine the dynasty. King Constantine I and Dowager Queen Olga therefore accepted easily that they become the godparents of the child. Still, neither the child nor her mother receive more official recognition; only in July 1922, and at the behest of Queen Sophia, a law was passed which allowed the King to retroactively recognize marriages of members of the Royal Family, although on a non-dynastic basis. With this legal subterfuge, Alexandra obtained the style of Royal Highness and the title of Princess of Greece and Denmark. Aspasia's status, however, was not changed with the law and she remained a simple commoner to the eyes of protocol.|$|E

25|$|In May1938 {{with the}} Religions Law, Puyi was {{declared}} a god, and a cult of emperor-worship {{very similar to}} Japan's began with schoolchildren starting their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} god-emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. Puyi's elevation to a god was due to the Sino-Japanese war, which caused the Japanese state to begin a program of totalitarian mobilization of society for total war in Japan and the places ruled by Japan. His Japanese handlers felt that ordinary people in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were more willing to bear the sacrifices for total war because of their devotion to their god-emperor, and it was decided that making Puyi into a god-emperor would have the same effect in Manchukuo. After 1938, Puyi was hardly ever allowed to leave the Salt Tax Palace, while the creation of the puppet regime of President Wang Jingwei in November1938 crushed Puyi's spirits, as it ended his hope of one day being restored as the Great Qing Emperor. Puyi became a hypochondriac, taking all sorts of pills for various imagined aliments and hormones to improve his sex drive and allow him to father a boy, as Puyi was convinced that the Japanese were poisoning his food to make him sterile. Puyi believed that Japanese wanted one of the children that Pujie had fathered with his Japanese wife Lady Saga to be the next emperor, and it was a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> to him that their children were both girls (Manchukuo law forbade female succession to the throne).|$|E

500|$|Yamasaki, who had {{previously}} designed Saudi Arabia's Dhahran International Airport with the Saudi Binladin Group, incorporated features of Arabic architecture into {{the design of the}} World Trade Center. The plaza was modelled after Mecca, incorporating features such as a vast delineated square, a fountain, and a radial circular pattern. Yamasaki described the plaza as [...] "a mecca, a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> from the narrow streets and sidewalks of the Wall Street area." [...] He also incorporated other features of Arabic architecture into the building design, including pointed arches, interweaving tracery of prefabricated concrete, a minaret like flight tower, and arabesque patterns.|$|E
500|$|However, when {{it seemed}} that Germany {{was on the verge}} of victory, the Chancellor began to revise his statements.

[...] Given this promise, it came as a <b>great</b> <b>relief</b> to most Luxembourgers that the British and French halted the German advance at the Battle of the Marne in mid-September. [...] The result for the combatant nations was trench warfare, but, for Luxembourg, it was the indefinite continuation of German occupation.|$|E

500|$|It rapidly {{became a}} very popular exhibit, and the crank-handle {{controlling}} the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public. The French author Gustave Flaubert visited London in 1851 to see the Great Exhibition, writes Julian Barnes, but finding nothing of interest in The Crystal Palace, visited the East India Company Museum where he was greatly enamoured by Tipu's Tiger.
