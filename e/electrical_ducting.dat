50|$|Once double-tracking of {{the railway}} line from Wellington was completed, the {{original}} station building was replaced in 1940 {{with the current}} island platform. The station's platform upgrade in 2010 raised platform height, bringing it into line with other stations on the network and added safety features such as yellow tactile strips and put <b>electrical</b> <b>ducting</b> in place to support a real time passenger information system later introduced by the Greater Wellington Regional Council.|$|E
50|$|In May 2004, Ithaa's {{construction}} {{began in}} Singapore. In October 2004, the construction work was completed including {{the installation of}} 5 m wide acrylic arches, air conditioning and <b>electrical</b> <b>ducts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Maple Floor Manufactures Association {{does not}} {{recommend}} {{the use of}} masking, theatrical, construction, <b>electrical,</b> <b>duct,</b> adhesive or {{any other kind of}} tape to mark temporary court boundaries on the surface of a finished maple floor. It is likely that the tape, when removed, will peel away layers of the floor’s surface finish. Most tapes promoted for temporary markings have a different coefficient of friction than finishes applied to the maple playing surface, and can impact a person’s ability to start, stop and pivot. Removing the surface paint/finish and exposing the maple can result in additional chipping and peeling of the remaining paint/finish in adjacent areas.|$|R
50|$|Cellular floor {{raceways}} are <b>electrical</b> wiring <b>ducts</b> or cells {{made from}} steel floor deck {{that serve as}} structural formwork for placement of concrete floor slabs and also as wire and cable raceways within the concrete floor slab.|$|R
5000|$|Backyard golf is a lawn {{game played}} in the United States. [...] The game {{is very similar to}} golf; however, it uses fewer clubs (i.e. sand wedge, {{pitching}} wedge, and nine iron). The balls are wiffleballs that are often covered with <b>electrical,</b> <b>duct,</b> or masking tape. The courses typically consist of one central hole location where different tee boxes constitute different [...] "holes." [...] Most courses have nine holes, although larger yards have been known to have 18 or 36 holes. The game is very easy to play as it requires minimal technical skill. The large size of the ball and short distance of the holes make backyard golf conducive to casual play.|$|R
5000|$|Penetrants, or {{penetrating}} items, are the mechanical, electrical or structural {{items that}} pass through {{an opening in}} a wall or floor, such as pipes, <b>electrical</b> conduits, <b>ducting,</b> <b>electrical</b> cables and cable trays, or structural steel beams and columns. When these items pierce a wall or floor assembly, they create a space between the penetrant and the surrounding structure, which can become an avenue for the spread of fire between rooms or floors. Modern building codes generally require a service penetration firestop to seal the openings around penetrants (or [...] "services"), in order to restore the fire-resistance rating of the parent assembly.|$|R
40|$|Sway {{reduction}} is very vital in a nonlinear oscillatory system {{such as a}} gantry crane. In this paper, a new design is proposed for active sway control of a gantry crane using an <b>electrical</b> <b>ducted</b> fan. The thrust force developed by the motor is used to cancel out payload oscillation. A dynamic model of the crane with a ducted fan is derived and simulated using Matlab. Performance of the proposed technique is investigated for a crane subjected to initial sway and an external force input. In addition, cases with different payloads and cable lengths are also studied. Simulation results show satisfactory performance of the fan-controlled system in eliminating the payload sway. The proposed design can also handle changes in payload and cable length. A main advantage {{of this approach is}} that it does not require modeling of the crane in real time experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Rattan is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used material for bastons in Arnis training. They are light, flexible and good for training in speed. They are made from dried and cut reeds and are typically cut 26"-30" [...] in length, 3/4"-1" [...] in diameter and rounded at both ends. Prolonged impact training with rattan sticks will tend to splinter their ends so some practitioners use <b>electrical</b> or <b>duct</b> tape in order to protect their bastons, as they are more expensive outside of the Philippines.|$|R
40|$|A sonic {{levitation}} apparatus is disclosed {{which includes}} a sonic transducer which generates acoustical energy responsive {{to the level of}} an <b>electrical</b> amplifier. A <b>duct</b> communicates with an acoustical chamber to deliver an oscillatory motion of air to a plenum section which contains a collimated hole structure having a plurality of parallel orifices. The collimated hole structure converts the motion of the air to a pulsed. Unidirectional stream providing enough force to levitate a material specimen. Particular application to the production of microballoons in low gravity environment is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Fish {{tapes are}} usually stored coiled on a plastic reel. Because of this, {{they have a}} natural {{curvature}} {{and it is this}} curvature that allows them to be guided. By manipulating the reel, the end of the tape can be directed slightly. The tape is rigid enough that it can then be pushed in the direction in which it is pointing. In this way it can be easily guided through an empty wall cavity. Thermal insulation, firestops, pipes, HVAC <b>ducts,</b> <b>electrical</b> conduits, and other obstructions make use of a fish tape more challenging.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed to}} be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of 9 to 13.4 m and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning <b>ducting,</b> <b>electrical</b> trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.|$|R
5000|$|A {{week later}} Austin {{attended}} the anti-World Economic Forum protests in New York City {{where he was}} arrested by the FBI for [...] "distribution of information relating to explosives, destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction." [...] When he was arrested, Austin was carrying a black mask, a gas mask, and a lighter; his car contained an empty gas canister, <b>electrical</b> wiring, and <b>duct</b> tape. He asked to be released so he could travel to the trial jurisdiction on his own, but the federal prosecutor argued that Austin's alleged vow to [...] "take violent action to stop the 2002 Olympics" [...] and [...] "burn" [...] the event posed another serious threat. Federal Magistrate Henry Pitman ruled that Austin would remain in custody for the trip back to California.|$|R
40|$|Engine {{external}} components {{include all}} the fluid carrying, electron carrying, and support devices that are needed to operate the propulsion system. These components are varied and include: pumps, valves, actuators, solenoids, sensors, switches, heat exchangers, electrical generators, <b>electrical</b> harnesses, tubes, <b>ducts,</b> clamps and brackets. The failure of any component to perform its intended function {{will result in a}} maintenance action, a dispatch delay, or an engine in flight shutdown. The life of each component, in addition to its basic functional design, is closely tied to its thermal and dynamic environment. Therefore, to reach a mature design life, the component's thermal and dynamic environment must be understood and controlled, which can only be accomplished by attention to design analysis and testing. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review analysis and test techniques toward achieving good component health...|$|R
5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for <b>electrical</b> cables, ventilation <b>ducts</b> and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|R
40|$|Web {{openings}} in beams occur quite often in practice to provide convenient passage of <b>electrical</b> and mechanical <b>ducts.</b> Shear failure may dominate {{in cases where}} web opening created or the flexural strength has been increased. In such cases, increasing the shear capacity can prevent catastrophic shear failure. In this paper, {{the investigation of the}} response of simply supported reinforced concrete T-beams with multiple web circular openings is presented. An experimental research program was conducted on the shear behavior of simply supported beams subjected to an incremental concentrated static load at mid span. Seven reinforced concrete T-beams were tested with two design parameters, including number of web circular openings (four or six) and the method which was used to strengthen the member at openings (using internal deformed steel bars {{as in the case of}} the openings are planned before casting the beams or using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabric as in the case of the openings will be created in the existing beams). Test results indicated that the strengthening of beams at openings may compensate the decrease of the beam capacity due to the existence of the openings under static loading. The compensation of the beam capacity depends on the strengthening method which was adopted. The gain in shear capacity of the tested beams ranged between 27 % and 92 % which also represents about 86 % to 114 % of the reference solid beam capacity under static loading. A nonlinear finite element program, ANSYS 12. 1 release, was used to validate the results of the tested beams. Comparisons between the finite element predictions and experimental results in terms of failure loads and load-deflection relationships are presented and showed good agreement...|$|R
