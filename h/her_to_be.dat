5|$|The verdict, {{which was}} reached in a {{district}} court and {{would need to be}} upheld by a superior court, has received worldwide attention. Various petitions, including one that received 400,000 signatures, were organized to protest Noreen's imprisonment, and Pope Benedict XVI publicly called for the charges against <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dismissed. She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed. Christian minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti and Muslim politician Salmaan Taseer were both assassinated for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws. Noreen's family went into hiding after receiving death threats, some of which threatened to kill Asia if released from prison.|$|E
