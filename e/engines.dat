5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the two boats, the Austro-Hungarian Navy evaluated the U-1 class in trials through 1910.

Because of the problems, the Austro-Hungarian Navy considered the <b>engines</b> to be unsuitable for wartime use and paid only for the hulls and armament of the two U-1 boats.

Boeing stated that podded <b>engines</b> were selected for their passenger airliners because buried <b>engines</b> carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
