25|$|Between 1943-1944 Illesheim {{was only}} {{attacked}} twice, once along {{the railroad tracks}} and once on the airfield with two drone aircraft being destroyed as a result. In early April 1945, the last Luftwaffe unit, Zerstörergeschwader 101 (ZG 101), flying a mixture of Bf 110s and Ju 88s, left the airfield, taking with them <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be transported and burning the rest.|$|E
25|$|Cardiacs toured and gigged {{intermittently}} during 1990, {{culminating in}} a shared concert with Napalm Death at Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 August. The Cardiacs half of the concert was filmed and released as the video Maresnest (produced by Steve Mallet and directed by Steve Payne, and eventually also released as the 1995 live album All that Glitters is a Mares Nest). The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, {{it was also an}} occasion on which <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> go wrong, did go wrong. Among other things, Tim Smith's guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith's saxophone.|$|E

25|$|The Pacers {{finished}} the 2006–07 season {{as one of}} the worst seasons in team history. For the Pacers, who finished with a 35–47 record, nearly <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have gone wrong did. The turning point of the season would be an 11-game losing streak that started around the all-star break. Injuries to Jermaine O'Neal and Marquis Daniels, a lack of a solid back up point guard, the blockbuster trade midway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry, poor defensive efforts, and being the NBA's worst offensive team were the main reasons leading to the team's struggles. The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked the Pacers out of the playoffs {{for the first time since}} the 1996–97 season.|$|E
500|$|In Egypt and Algeria, {{scientific}} work took {{place under the}} army’s protection. In the Morea, most troops were departing when exploration had barely begun. The army was content to provide logistical support: “tents, stakes, tools, liquid containers, large pots and sacks; in a word, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be found for us {{to use in the}} army’s storehouses.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hurricane}} caused much coastal damage {{particularly in}} the Cape Hatteras area during September 9 and September 10 and then {{to other parts of}} the North Carolina coast. Flooding was reported at New Bern. Considerable wind damage also occurred. An article from the Wilmington Journal reported that, [...] "It looked as though <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be blown down, was down. Fences were prostrated in all directions, and the streets filled with the limbs and bodies of trees up-rooted or twisted off.".|$|E

500|$|Truman {{then sent}} another {{representative}} to China, General Albert Wedemeyer, who had commanded U.S. troops in China during the war, on a fact finding mission. Again, the Dixie Mission in Yan'an hosted the presidential mission. [...] Wedemeyer reported that U.S. interests were best served by continued {{support for the}} Nationalist government, but Truman suppressed the report because he was waiting to see who would win and refused to expand aid the Nationalists {{so as to avoid}} involvement in the Chinese Civil War. After Wedemeyer's visit, the U.S. packed up operations in Yan'an and liquidated <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be transported aboard a C-47. [...] On 11 March 1947, the last members of the Dixie Mission left Yan'an.|$|E
500|$|The {{same day}} that Mexican troops {{departed}} Béxar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic. [...] Just after [...] on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements. [...] A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat. [...] The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on. [...] <b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be carried was burned, and the army's only two cannon were thrown into the Guadalupe River. [...] When Ramírez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Infamous 2, Sucker Punch {{decided to}} look at <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be improved, saying [...] "everything was on the table". Due to negative feedback from fans, they redesigned the main character, Cole. Cole initially underwent many changes, {{to the extent of}} making him look like a different character. However, after being [...] "taken aback by the uproar of fan support for the original Cole," [...] Sucker Punch combined elements of the original with the new design. Some of Cole's clothing was changed to suit the new setting of the game. Eric Ladin was also brought in to replace Jason Cottle as the voice of Cole because Sucker Punch felt that they needed someone who could perform Cole's physical reactions as well as his voice with the use of their new motion capture technology.|$|E

500|$|Glee {{choreographer}} Zach Woodlee described [...] "Proud Mary" [...] as the [...] "scariest" [...] number produced to date, citing {{concerns with}} choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, {{and that the}} actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: [...] "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You lose your balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> go wrong, did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't want anyone to get up." [...] Woodlee agreed: [...] "If it looked too fun and easy, it wouldn't read right. Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with." ...|$|E

As with the Landi in 1939, a flotilla of commuter ferries was set up. Once again, a cable car was constructed, whose 55-m-high pillars became a special attraction. These pillars, which were designed by architect Werner Stücheli with collaboration from engineer Max Walt, were exuberantly praised in the magazine “Schweizerische Bauzeitung”: “A few weeks ago the big surprise: The cable car’s pillars, which connect the banks. Their beauty and greatness surpass <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be seen in an exhibition on architecture in previous years, even Brussels.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is {{an interpretation of}} quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual [...] "world" [...] (or [...] "universe"). In layman's terms, the hypothesis states {{there is a very}} large—perhaps infinite—number of universes, and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes. The theory is also referred to as MWI, the relative state formulation, the Everett interpretation, the theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation, [...] multi-history or just many-worlds.|$|E
2500|$|Although Friedkin has {{admitted}} {{he is very}} reluctant {{to speak about the}} factual aspects of the film, he made the film with the intention of immortalizing the events involving Doe that took place in St. Louis in 1949, and despite the relatively minor changes that were made, the film depicts <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be verified by those involved. In order to make the film, Friedkin was allowed access to the diaries of the priests involved, as well as the doctors and nurses; he also discussed the events with Doe's aunt in great detail. Friedkin has said that he does not believe that the [...] "head-spinning" [...] actually occurred, but this has been disputed. Friedkin is secular, despite coming from a Jewish family.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few minutes}} later, the [...] "altitude" [...] warning sounded, and the Captain {{stated that he}} had sighted the runway. The flaps were {{selected}} up and the crew selected the landing gears up. The Captain stated that he didn't want to stall the plane. The Captain then concluded that “we just lost everything, we lost an engine, I lost both engines”. And during the next twenty five seconds, the Captain requested for <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> help recover thrust including “relight”, “ignition override” “just anything” {{to be given to}} him. The crew then applied stabilizer trim several times as they tried to avoid obstacles and buildings ahead of them, however their attempts were useless.

He nagged, charmed, threw parties, he created word-of-mouth– <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be done in Hollywood to promote a project.

[...] Deeley added that Carr's promotion of the film was influential in positioning The Deer Hunter for Oscar nominations.|$|E
