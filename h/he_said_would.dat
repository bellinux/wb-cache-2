5|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, Sihanouk loyalists {{had been}} purged from all of GRUNK's {{ministries}} {{and all of the}} prince's supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were gearing up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>would</b> be the model.|$|E
5|$|The Arab Spring began {{sweeping}} the Arab world in 2011, where large-scale protests erupted demanding {{economic and political}} reforms. However, many of these protests in some countries turned into civil wars and more instability. In Jordan, in response to domestic unrest, Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduced a number of reforms including: amending the Constitution and establishing a number of governmental commissions. Proportional representation was re-introduced to the Jordanian parliament in the 2016 general election, a move which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments. Although some local opposition groups called his reforms inadequate, other observers praised them. They took place amid unprecedented regional instability: an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country {{and the emergence of}} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).|$|E
25|$|Sarkozy <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{develop nuclear}} {{technologies}} {{and increase the}} tax on pollution. <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> promote international law on environment.|$|R

It's not long now the way it was: it's got it cropped close to its head, the way <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> Huck, I never see {{anything}} look any more naturaler than what It does." ...|$|R
60|$|This speech pleased the captain, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{help them}} willingly.|$|R
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual {{income tax rates}} across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{funds for}} her {{continuing}} care {{were provided by}} Charles Widmore. As a result of Theresa's fate, Oxford fired Daniel and quietly removed all references to him ever having been at the university. At some point, Daniel also performed an experiment upon himself, resulting in long-term memory damage. While in Essex, Massachusetts, Daniel saw a news report covering {{the discovery of the}} apparent wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 {{in the depths of the}} Sunda Trench. Widmore approached Daniel and after informing him that the Sunda Trench wreckage was a hoax, urged him to go to the island, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> heal him of his plight. At first, Daniel was reluctant, but Eloise convinced him to go. Daniel is then recruited into a covert team alongside Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), which is organized by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) and led by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). Their mission was to travel to the island, find Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the then current leader of the Others, and disable the Dharma Initiative station called the Tempest, which contained poisonous gases.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment {{not only on}} the team, but in the entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him, and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E
25|$|Defense Secretary Ash Carter {{announced}} plans to create 3,600 new breast-feeding rooms across the country, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> put a breast-feeding room in all military buildings that have more than 50 female employees.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, {{during a}} week of heavy {{fundraising}} from oil company executives, Romney put forward {{what he called a}} comprehensive energy plan that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> allow North America to become independent of foreign oil imports within a decade.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Hovind made a $10,000 {{offer to}} anyone who could meet a set of {{requirements}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> prove evolution, and he later raised the amount to $250,000. In 2007, Creation Science Evangelism removed the offer from its website.|$|E
25|$|Shevardnadze took much of {{the credit}} for Georgia's {{economic}} performance under his rule. Seven months before his promotion to the Soviet Foreign Affairs Ministership, Shevardnadze said there were thirty or more economic experiments operating in Georgia, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> further democratise the economic management.|$|E
25|$|Lessig {{has stated}} that if elected President he would resign in favor of his vice {{president}} when he accomplishes his three stated objectives, which involve addressing campaign finance reform, voting rights issues and political gerrymandering. Prior to his {{dropping out of the}} race, he had yet to announce his vice presidential running mate, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> have been decided at the Democratic National Convention.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{install a}} woman {{as head of the}} Central Bank and a famous {{economist}} as his Minister of Finance. <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> use Sunni Muslims in his cabinet.|$|R

25|$|The {{first known}} {{use of the}} term Salish Sea was in 1988, when marine {{biologist}} Bert Webber from Bellingham, Washington, created the name for the combined waters in the region with the intention to complement the names Georgia Strait, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, not replace them. The adoption of the term, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>would</b> raise consciousness about taking care of the region's waters and ecosystems. Webber's efforts are credited with the official recognition of the term in Canada and the U.S.|$|E
25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could {{be done on the}} three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>would</b> ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|E
25|$|After being {{sworn in}} as the MP for Calgary Centre North on July 16, Conservative Party Leader Stephen Harper named Prentice to the Shadow Cabinet as the Official Opposition Critic for Indian and Northern Affairs. In that role Prentice opposed the Tli Cho land claim agreement, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> make Canadian law {{secondary}} to Tlicho local law. Prentice was also {{a strong supporter of}} the proposed and controversial Mackenzie Valley pipeline. He criticized the Liberal government for its treatment of aboriginal women, and its alleged costs of administering the Residential School Claims program for aboriginal victims of abuse.|$|E

25|$|The next Phillip St revue was Around the Loop, {{which again}} teamed Oldaker, Gordon Chater, Blacklock and Humphries, plus {{newcomer}} June Salter. Humphries revived the Edna character (for what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> {{be the last}} time) and the revue {{proved to be a}} major hit, playing eight shows a week for 14 months. During this period Humphries was living near Bondi and while out walking one day he had a chance meeting with an elderly man who had a high, scratchy voice and a pedantic manner of speech; this encounter inspired the creation of another of Humphries' most enduring characters, Sandy Stone.|$|E
25|$|The answer, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>would</b> largely {{depend on}} the way in which {{sovereignty}} was said to have been acquired. He observed that although the legal authorities claimed that sovereignty over Australia was acquired by occupation, the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, sovereignty was actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both the prosecution and the defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them sufficient land for their sustenance.|$|E
25|$|Schneerson, {{who had an}} {{intimate}} knowledge of the Soviet government and their tactics, opposed demonstrations on behalf of Soviet Jews, stating that he had evidence that they were harming Russia's Jews. Instead he advocated quiet diplomacy, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>would</b> be more effective. Schneerson did whatever was {{in his power to}} push for the release of Jews from the former Soviet Union and established schools, communities and other humanitarian resources to assist with their absorption into Israel. On one known occasion he instructed Senator Chic Hecht to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.|$|E

The next month it was {{revealed}} that he missed more than four out of every five Dáil votes in 2009 – by far the worst record of any TD.|$|R
50|$|The UUP leader, Mike Nesbitt, {{promoted}} {{the possibility of}} a UUP/SDLP administration. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give his voting preference after the UUP candidates to the SDLP, although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not tell UUP voters what to do with their later preferences. Other UUP candidates opposed the action, saying they will give later preferences to other unionist candidates over the SDLP, and one UUP councillor resigned from the party in protest.|$|R
