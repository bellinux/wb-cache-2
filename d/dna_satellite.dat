Cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) is associated with several distinct geminivirus of the genus Begomovirus, which are able to replicate and spread in susceptible host plants including cotton when inoculated with <b>DNA</b> <b>satellite</b> called DNA beta. DNA beta is a novel single stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>satellite</b> of approximately 1350 nucleotides in length that has been isolated from infected cotton plants is found to be essential for induction of the characteristic symptoms in cotton. DNA Î² is biologically functional, being required for amplification of DNA A to high levels and for the efficient systemic spread of infection throughout susceptible cotton plant. Two strategies (transient assay and stable transformation) were used to block beta molecule through RNAi technology. The Î² Cl-C 2 genes encoded by CLCuV/DNA Î² (U 89) were targeted in transient assay and Î² Cl CLCuV/DNA Î² (U 77 - 4) for stable transformation to developed resistance against CLCuD. Since Î² Cl protein is a virulence determinant that suppresses RNA silencing and hypersensitive response (HR), the targeting of this gene is likely to protect plants against virus infection. Results confirmed that DNA beta encodes a virulent factor that suppresses host defense responses. The Cl-C 2 region was cloned in RNAi vector (pFGC 5941 dsRNA) and vector containing the same in the sense or antisense and both orientations in the same vector were also developed. For stable transformation beta Cl along with promoter region was cloned in plant expression vector pBin 61 for producing dsRNA through double promoter (one side of Cl gene is 35 S promoter and other side is Î² promoter). These constructs were transformed in A. tumefaciens strain LBA 4404. The RNAi vector containing Cl-C 2 region of DNA Î² was then transiently expressed in N. bethamiana in combinations of infectious clones {DNA A (PK 3) + DNA Î² and DNA A (H 12) + DNA Î² }. The Cl region of DNA Î² was then transformed in N. tabacum through Agrobacterium mediated leaf disc transformation. The presence of transgene was confirmed through PCR and southern hybridization in transgenic plants. Evaluation of transgenic plants through whitefly inoculation and infectious clones showed the complete blockage of Î² replication and developed resistance against CLCuV. Results showed that RNA mediated silencing of a virulence gene derived from a <b>DNA</b> <b>satellite</b> can interfere with virus infection in a sequence-specific manner.

40|$|Polytoma obtusum has a main band DNA (a) with a {{buoyant density}} in CsC 1 of p = 1. 711 g/ml {{and a light}} <b>DNA</b> <b>satellite</b> (fl) with p = 1. 682 g/ml. B-DNA was {{substantially}} enriched in a fraction containing small leucoplast fragments and some mitochondria, which was obtained in a pellet sedimenting between 3, 000 g and 5, 000 g. A crude mitochondrial pellet was also obtained by sedimenting at 12, 000 g to recover particulates remaining in the supernate after 10 min at 5, 000 g. This fraction contained a third DNA component (3 ') with p = 1. 714 g/ml. We {{have concluded that the}} leucoplasts of P. obtusum contain the fl-DNA (1. 682) and the mitochondria possess the 3 "-component (!. 714). Two distinct classes of ribosomes were isolated and separated by sucrose density gradients, a major 79 S species and a minor species at 75 S. The major species possessed the 25 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), characteristic of cytoplasmic ribosomes, and these particles co-sedimented in sucrose gradients with the 79 S cytoplasmic ribosomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The minor species wa...|$|E
40|$|Background Cotton leaf curl {{disease in}} the Indian subcontinent is {{associated}} with several distinct begomoviruses that interact with a disease-specific <b>DNA</b> <b>satellite</b> named Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). However, we have recently reported that Chili leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) is also occasionally found associated with the disease in Pakistan. The {{question as to whether}} ChLCB contributes to the development of disease symptoms such as leaf curling and enations remain to be answered. We have previously shown that the expression of βC 1 of CLCuMB develops all symptoms of cotton leaf curl disease in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from PVX vector. Findings The role of ChLCB in the induction of typical disease symptoms was studied by its expression from PVX vector in N. benthamiana. The expression of βC 1 from PVX vector developed severe leaf curl symptoms and leaf-like enations that resemble the phenotype induced by βC 1 of CLCuMB. Conclusions The results presented here show that the expression of βC 1 of ChLCB from PVX vector exhibit phenotype typical of cotton leaf curl and therefore ChLCB may contribute to the disease symptoms. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> {{are known}} for an unusual and {{nonuniform}} evolution characterized by rapid evolutionary change between species and concerted evolution leading to molecular homogeneity within species. In this paper we use <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> for phylogenetic analysis of a rapidly evolving lineage of spiders and compare the phylogeny with a hypothesis previously generated based on mitochondrial DNA and allozymes. The spiders examined include almost all species within a monophyletic clade of endemic Hawaiian Tetragnatha species, the spiny-leg clade. The phylogeny based on satellite sequences is largely congruent to those produced by mtDNA and allo-zymes, except that the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> yields much longer branches, {{with higher levels of}} support for any given node. Closely related species that have differ-entiated ecologically within an island are well re-solved with <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> but much less so with mtDNA. These results suggest that Tetragnatha stDNA repeats seem to be evolving gradually and cohesively during the diversification of these endemic Hawaiian spiders. The study also reveals gain–loss of <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> copies during species diversification. We conclude that <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences may potentially be very useful for resolving relationships between rapidly evolving taxa within an adaptive radiation. In addition, <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> as a nuclear marker suggests that hybridization or peripatry could play a possible role in species formation that cannot be revealed by mitochondrial markers due to its maternal inheritance...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila genome {{contains}} nearly 2. 8 X 10 (4) kilobases of <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA.</b> This simple sequence <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> {{is contained}} within transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin that is distributed among all chromosomes with a concentration at the centromeres {{and along the}} length of the Y chromosome. To investigate the relationship of the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> with the surrounding sequences, we have isolated a satellite junction sequence that is repetitive and specifically adjacent to the 1. 672 g/cm 3 <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA.</b> It is conserved between strains of Drosophila melanogaster and localized to the chromocenter of polytene chromosomes. The characteristics of this sequence suggest a functional role involving the specific organization of large regions of chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Tandemly {{repeated}} DNAs, {{referred to}} as <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs,</b> often occur in a genome in a genus-specific manner. However, the mechanisms for generation and evolution for these sequences are largely unknown because of the uncertain origins of the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> We found highly divergent genus-specific <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> that showed sequence similarity with genus-specific intergenic spacers (IGSs) in the family Solanaceae, which includes the genera Nicotiana, Solanum and Capsicum. The conserved position of the IGS between 25 S and 18 S rDNA facilitates comparison of IGS sequences across genera, even {{in the presence of}} very low sequence similarity. Sequence comparison of IGS may elucidate the procedure of the genesis of complex monomer units of the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Within the IGS of Capsicum species, base substitutions and copy number variation of subrepeat monomers were causes of monomer divergence in IGS sequences. At the level of inter-generic IGS sequences of the family Solanaceae, however, genus-specific motif selection, motif shuffling between subrepeats and differential amplification among motifs were involved in formation of genus-specific IGS. Therefore, the genus-specific <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> in Solanaceae plants can be generated from differentially organized repeat monomers of the IGS rather than by accumulation of mutations from pre-existent <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs...</b>|$|R
