40|$|Findings on the {{association}} of NQO 1 C 609 T polymorphism in the NQO 1 gene and cardiovascular disease susceptibility are controversial. The objective {{of the current study}} was to examine the relationship between this polymorphism and the presence and severity of angiographically determined coronary artery disease (CAD). One-hundred and forty-five patients with newly diagnosed angiographically documented CAD (≥ 50 % luminal stenosis of any coronary vessel) as case group were compared to 139 controls (subjects with no luminal stenosis at coronary arteries). The presence of C 609 T polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. Among total population, those with combined CT/TT (T allele carrier) genotype showed a trend toward lower odds of CAD compared to those with CC (wild type) genotype, but it did not reach a statistically significant level (p = 0. 061). When data were analyzed separately for men or women, CT + TT group as compared to CC genotype was associated with decreased odds of CAD in women (adjusted OR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 0. 9; p = 0. 043), but not in men (adjusted OR 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 3 - 1. 9; p = 0. 612).

ObjectiveTo investigate the capacity of a lifestyle program to improve the composition and antioxidative function (AOX) of small dense HDL 3 c in MetS. MethodsPatients with MetS (n= 33) not taking lipid-lowering drugs were recruited to follow a 12 -week educational program to reduce caloric intake and to increase physical activity. HDL subfractions were preparatively isolated by isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation. AOX of HDL 3 c was assessed as its capacity to inhibit LDL oxidation induced by an azoinitiator. ResultsAOX of HDL 3 c was significantly improved (mean reduction in the propagation rate of LDL oxidation by HDL 3 c, - 6. 8 %, p= 0. 03) and systemic oxidative stress, assessed as plasma levels of 8 -isoprostanes, tended to decrease in normocholesterolemic MetS patients (LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) < 130 mg/dl), but not in patients with elevated LDL-C levels and <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population.</b> Both <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> and <b>in</b> the normocholesterolemic subgroup, lifestyle intervention resulted in a significant degree of normalisation of HDL 3 c composition, (enrichment in apolipoprotein A-I and cholesterylesters, depletion in triglycerides), which was more pronounced at LDL-C< 130 mg/dl. ConclusionIn patients with MetS, a lifestyle program improves AOX of small, dense HDL in subjects with normal LDL-C levels.

40|$|Abstract Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is often the}} leading cause of death and the most common cause of {{permanent}} disability in children and young adults. The hospital admission rates as well as the incidence and mortality rates of TBI vary enormously in different countries and populations. Even though alcohol misuse is a well-known modifiable risk factor for TBI and other injuries, few studies have been carried out on drinking patterns in relation to TBI, alcohol's role in recurrent brain injuries as well as TBI in relation to alcohol use in children and adolescents. The Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort was used to study the epidemiology and recurrence of TBI as well as alcohol use by children with TBI by the age of 14 years and those who sustained TBI later in life. The role of parents' alcohol misuse on children's TBI was also studied. The incidence of TBI <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> was 118 / 100   000 person-years (PY), and the pediatric incidence of TBI (children aged under 16 years) was 130 / 100   000 PY. Up to the age of 10 years, the occurrence of TBI did not differ by gender, but after that age, boys and men had a higher incidence compared to girls and women. Mortality from TBI <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> was 14 / 100   000 PY. Parental alcohol misuse and male gender were significant risk factors for the occurrence of TBI in childhood. Drinking to intoxication at the age of 14 years was a more common habit of TBI subjects than controls, especially among girls. Frequent alcohol drinking and drunkenness reported at the age of 14 years as well as male gender were independent predictors of TBI later in life. An alcohol-related first TBI and urban place of birth were found to be significant risk factors for recurrent TBI. A significant positive correlation between first and recurrent TBIs with respect to alcohol involvement was observed. Alcohol drinking and parental alcohol misuse should be recognized among children and adolescents with acute TBI. Because alcohol drinking predicts the recurrence of TBI, a brief intervention focused on drinking habits is needed as an immediate preventive measure...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdInformation on reimbursed diabetes medica-tion (including both type 1 and 2 diabetes) of all Finnish individuals with reimbursed AD medication in 2005 (n = 28, 093) and their AD-free control subjects during 1972 – 2005 was obtained from a special reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institute of Finland.

40|$|PURPOSE: To report {{longitudinal}} changes in {{and explore the}} influence of cognition on social functioning in mildly disabled patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Italian patients (18 - 50 years) with RRMS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤ 4. 0 were assigned to interferon β- 1 a, 44 or 22 μg subcutaneously three times weekly, and underwent annual assessments for social functioning (Environmental Status Scale [ESS]) over 3 years. RESULTS: Baseline total ESS score did not differ between patients with and without cognitive impairment (P = 0. 505). Total ESS score remained low (< 2. 0) and stable over 3 years <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population,</b> but worsened slightly when assessed by assigned treatment or treatment and baseline cognitive status (both P = 0. 004), driven mostly by changes in the 'transportation' and 'financial/economic status' subscales. The strongest independent predictor of worsening ESS score was baseline EDSS score. Test-retest analyses confirmed that total ESS score and most subscales changed little over 3 years. CONCLUSION: ESS scores remained low and changed minimally over 3 years, reflecting the mild physical disability and good cognitive performance in this patient population. Determining the influence of cognitive function and treatment on {{longitudinal changes}} in social functioning requires further studies...|$|R
40|$|Aims/hypothesis Outcome data on {{individuals}} with diabetic foot ulcers are scarce, especially {{in those with}} peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We therefore examined the clinical characteristics that best predict poor outcome in a large population of diabetic foot ulcer patients and examined whether such predictors differ between patients with and without PAD. Methods Analyses were conducted within the EURODIALE Study, a prospective cohort study of 1, 088 diabetic foot ulcer patients across 14 centres in Europe. Multiple logistic regression modelling was used to identify independent predictors of outcome (i. e. non-healing of the foot ulcer). Results After 1 year of follow-up, 23 % of the patients had not healed. Independent baseline predictors of non-healing <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> were older age, male sex, heart failure, the inability to stand or walk without help, end-stage renal disease, larger ulcer size, peripheral neuropathy and PAD. When analyses were performed according to PAD status, infection emerged as a specific predictor of non-healing in PAD patients only. Conclusions/Interpretation Predictors of healing differ between patients with and without PAD, suggesting that diabetic foot ulcers with or without concomitant PAD should be defined as two separate disease states. The observed negative impact of infection on healing that was confined to patients with PAD needs further investigation...|$|R

Lipid-laden alveolar macrophages and pH monitoring {{have been used in}} the diagnosis of chronic aspiration in children with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). This study was conducted to prove a correlation between the detection of alimentary pulmonary fat phagocytosis and an increasing amount of proximal gastroesophageal reflux. It was assumed that proximal gastroesophageal reflux better correlates with aspiration than distal GER. Patients from 6 months to 16 years with unexplained recurrent wheezy bronchitis and bronchial hyperreactivity, or recurrent pneumonia with chronic cough underwent 24 -hour double-channel pH monitoring and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Aspiration of gastric content was determined by counting lipid laden alveolar macrophages from BAL specimens.

Quantifying lipid-laden alveolar macrophages from BAL in children with gastroesophageal-related respiratory disorders does not have an acceptable specificity to prove chronic aspiration as an underlying etiology. Therefore, research for other markers of pulmonary aspiration is needed. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare oxidative/antioxidative status in obese and sport trained {{children}} and to correlate obtained redox markers with anthropometrical measurements, body composition parameters, and adipokines levels. 78 (44 males) obese (SG) and 80 (40 males) normal weight sport trained (CG) children matched for age and Tanner stage were recruited for the study. Body composition parameters and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Oxidative/antioxidative status was evaluated in plasma by total oxidative status (PerOX), oxidized-LDL cholesterol (oxLDL), total antioxidative capacity (ImAnOx), and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx). Leptin and adiponectin levels and adiponectin/leptin ratio (A/L) were also investigated. OxLDL was higher in SG versus CG (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), but ImAnOx and GPx were reduced in SG versus CG (P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

40|$|The CC 16 microprotein is {{the main}} {{secretory}} product of Clara cells, which are epithelial cells lining lung airways. In crossing through the bronchoalveolar/blood barrier, CC 16 diffuses passively into plasma. Serum CC 16 (sCC 16) has recently been proposed as a biomarker for detecting Clara cell impairments. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess if sCC 16 concentrations are reduced in a group of healthy young smokers. A group of 118 healthy young males volunteered to take part in the study. Each subject answered a questionnaire, and provided blood and urine samples. Serum CC 16, urinary cotinine and creatinine were measured. Median serum CC 16 concentrations were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (11. 3 mug l(- 1) vs 14. 6 mug l(- 1); p = 0. 005; N = 89 and 29, respectively) but did not correlate with either the daily or the life-time cigarette consumption, or with urinary cotinine concentrations. sCC 16 did not correlate with age or body mass index <b>in</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> or <b>in</b> the groups of smokers and non-smokers.

40|$|AIMS: An {{analysis}} {{was designed to}} determine whether chronic heart failure patients at high cardiovascular risk benefited {{to the same extent}} from high-dose lisinopril as the whole ATLAS population. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective {{analysis was}} performed on high-risk heart failure patients in the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril And Survival (ATLAS) trial (total number of patients 3164) comparing highdose (32. 5 - 35 mg. day(- 1)) vs low-dose (2. 5 - 5 mg. day(- 1)) lisinopril for a median of 46 months. These high-risk patients included those with hypotension, hyponatraemia, compromised renal function, the elderly and patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline. <b>In</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population,</b> high-dose lisinopril led to a trend in risk reduction of all-cause mortality (primary end-point P= 0. 128) and a significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality plus hospitalization (principal secondary end-point P= 0. 002). Subgroup analyses were performed for these end-points. There were no consistent interactions between age, baseline sodium, creatinine or potassium values, and treatment effect. Diabetics showed a beneficial response to high-dose therapy that was at least as good as that in non-diabetics. The underlying higher morbidity/mortality rates in diabetics mean that high-dose lisinopril has potential for a larger absolute clinical impact in these patients. CONCLUSION: Long-term high-dose lisinopril was as effective and well-tolerated in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes mellitus, as for the ATLAS <b>study</b> <b>population</b> as a <b>whole...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{erythrocyte}} binding antigen 175 (EBA- 175) is a 175 kDa antigen of Plasmodium falciparum {{and plays}} a major role in erythrocyte recognition by the parasite. The antigen is also supposed to be partly responsible for the invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites. EBA- 175 has been sequenced from the FCR- 3 and CAMP strains of P. falciparum. The sequences were identical in most parts of the gene. Differences were apparent in a 423 bp segment in the FCR- 3 strain, the F-Fragment, that is not found in the CAMP-strain and a 342 bp segment, the C-Fragment, which is present in the CAMP-strain but not in the FCR- 3 -strain. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of the two EBA- 175 -alleles in the Lao PDR. Materials & Methods Altogether, 240 blood-samples were collected in two areas of the country: Attapeu in the south and Lung Namtha in the north. Subsequently, the material was scanned for the F-and C-fragments. Results <b>In</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>study</b> <b>population,</b> 52 % carried the F-fragment, and 41 % the C-fragment while seven percent of the patients were infected with at least two parasite strains and showed both alleles. Conclusion Distribution of the alleles showed significant differences between the north and the south province.

40|$|International audienceThis {{report is}} a {{population-based}} study describing {{the pattern of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in two distinct regions in Tunisia. The study included a total of 11, 507 individuals sampled in 1996 from both genders, all age groups, urban and rural settings belonging to 2, 973 families. HCV infection was assessed by commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblot assays and detection of HCV RNA by PCR. HCV genotypes and subtypes were determined by sequencing in the 5 '-untranslated region (UTR) viral genomic region and the INNO-LiPA HCVII genotyping kit. Genetic relatedness between HCV strains was assessed by sequencing of {{a portion of the}} NS 5 B region. HCV prevalence was significantly higher in the North-Western region than in the Southern one: 1. 7 % versus 0. 2 % (P < 10 (- 3), chi(2) = 8, 506). There was no difference in positivity according to gender or living in rural or urban settings; the only significant risk factor was advanced age.

In this unselected sample of an adult male population, ACR (an early marker of organ damage), an elevated FENa (a proxy for dietary sodium intake), cholesterol and a higher basal blood pressure level were independent predictors of RH...|$|R
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to get better insight into the {{ulceration}} of hemangiomas, by comparing patient characteristics of non-ulcerated hemangiomas with hemangiomas with active or past ulceration. A retrospective analysis was performed of files of patients who visited the Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen (UMCN), the Netherlands, between 1997 and 2007 for one or more infantile hemangiomas. The medical records of 465 patients were reviewed. Twenty three {{percent of the patients}} were diagnosed with ulceration. The size of ulcerated hemangiomas was significantly larger (28. 6 cm 2 vs. 6. 0 cm 2, p < 0. 05). Predilection areas for ulceration were the head-neck region and the anogenital region. Ulceration was significantly most frequently seen in hemangiomas with a superficial (epidermal) component (98. 5 %, p < 0. 05) and a segmental distribution (29. 3 %, p < 0. 05).
