Lipid peroxidation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many neonatal complications because the antioxidant system of preterm infants is highly stressed and incompletely developed.

In {{the second part of}} the workshop, we will discuss strategies for coding intensities and variants of positive and negative affect expressions; facial expressions occurring in the context of infant-caregiver interactions and experimental manipulations; and facial expressions reflecting hedonic responses to sensory stimulation, cognitive information processing, and emotion regulation. Illustrations from research involving typically developing <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> toddlers, preterm <b>infants,</b> <b>and</b> <b>infants</b> in pediatric populations will be presented to illustrate the advantages of an empirical approach to research on facial expression in <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> children.

5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E
