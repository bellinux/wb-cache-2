40|$|On {{the hidden}} origin of <b>information</b> and <b>library</b> science in chemistryThe {{activities}} of the chemist and Nobel laureate Wilhelm Ostwald (1853 - 1932) suggest that subject-specific principles of chemistry influence the characteristics of modern information systems. The highly visible presence of chemists {{in the development of}} <b>information</b> and <b>library</b> science gives further evidence for the proximity of chemistry to <b>information</b> and <b>library</b> science. Subject-specific <b>information</b> problems affiliated with the coping of information overload {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century made necessary a comprehensive organization of scholarly communication through technical media and international associations. Historical research on the hidden origin of <b>information</b> and <b>library</b> science in chemistry together with reference to the positivistic attitude of information pioneers like Ostwald and Paul Otlet can make aware unilateral tendencies in information science and information practice which are observable today, e. g. within the field of information literacy.
