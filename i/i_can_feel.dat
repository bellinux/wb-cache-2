25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand. In {{the middle of}} the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, {{about the size of a}} penny, accompanied by acute pain in {{the middle of the}} red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> some pain.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

500|$|There {{had to be}} a cost. There {{had to be a}} price {{somebody}} {{paid for}} that discovery. Not everybody could take that. Not everyone could just say, [...] "OK, that didn't work out, let's go on to next week's episode." [...] It felt like somebody would just say, [...] "No, I'm done. I just want to find a little moment of time where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> good about myself one last time, then I'm finished with this long nightmare." [...] And that seemed like that would be Dualla.|$|E
500|$|When asked {{during the}} same {{interview}} why he believed Victor had so much commercial appeal, Braeden responded: [...] "I really don't know. I've always been a very emotional actor, in other words, the only criterion I go by when I film scenes is to make them as believable and real as possible. Maybe it's that. Maybe – and I'm not sure if there's any truth to this – but people can perhaps sense that I've seen a lot in my life. I've been through a lot, and maybe for that reason <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> empathy." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Biden {{did not see}} a rise in his {{poll numbers}} {{immediately}} after the Hart withdrawal, and was particularly stagnant in polls for the Iowa caucuses. [...] Nevertheless, Biden had confidence that he could prevail; {{on the eve of}} his announcement, he said: [...] "I'm going to win this thing. I really am. I just know it, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> it in my fingertips." [...] Some political professionals saw Biden as believing that he could simply will himself to win the race, but his continued ability to raise campaign funds gave him credibility as a candidate.|$|E

500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{speaks of}} a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad {{point in your life}} and {{somebody}} comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel,</b> I believe." ...|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> you on my lips / <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> it with the character." ...|$|E

500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E

500|$|... "This Is It" [...] is a pop ballad with {{a simple}} mid-tempo {{keyboard}} that lasts three minutes and thirty-six seconds. The song begins with Jackson singing, “This is it, here I stand / I’m {{the light of the}} world, I feel grand / Got this love <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> / And I know yes for sure it is real” and then he tenderly hits his signature high notes about a new lover he feels he’s known [...] "since 1,000 years." [...] Jackson's brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon (credited as The Jacksons) are featured as background vocals throughout the song. Background music includes fingersnaps, a [...] "soaring chorus," [...] big-build strings and [...] "bubbly guitars." [...] The song is played in the key of Bb major. Throughout the song, Jackson's vocal range spans from F4 to C6. The song's tempo is moderate, and its metronome speed is 96 beats per minute. According to the music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing and the Winnipeg Sun, the song is written in common time. The lyrics [...] "toggle between grandiosity" [...] ("This is it, here I stand / I'm the light of the world, I feel grand") and [...] "shy, romantic yearning" [...] ("I never heard a single word about you / Falling in love wasn't my plan"). Darrly Sterdan of the Winnipeg Sun felt that Jackson's voice and the background music sounded [...] "like a demo that's been fleshed out with overdubs and doowoppy backup vocals from his brothers." [...] Anthony McCartney, of the Associated Press felt that the finger-snap percussion [...] "echoes" [...] that present in Jackson's 1982 song [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] with Paul McCartney.|$|E
2500|$|Jay-Z {{says his}} {{earliest}} exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul {{artists such as}} Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says [...] "I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R, pop music, whatever. As long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to." [...] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West-productions included on The Blueprint.|$|E
2500|$|But {{the revival}} was short lived, and {{in light of}} the {{continuing}} prevalence for private equity, Kirkham took the chain private again, leveraging his family's own 9.46% stake with £150 million of family funds in an eventual £496 million deal. Kirkham told the Yorkshire Post: [...] "It's something that's caused me fitful sleep in the time I've been thinking about it. [...] I've no hobby, this is my hobby – it's what I do. I'm an entrepreneur. It's almost as if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> the adrenaline running through my veins." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her {{international}} {{success has}} also received much attention. During {{an interview with}} Kyary, she was asked if she meant to make music outside of Asia, where she responded; [...] "At first, I didn't think about global markets at all. But even in Japanese, my lyrics don’t make any sense and {{have a kind of}} mystery, like on Pon Pon Pon and Tsukema Tsukeru. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> that what I'm doing in Japanese is catchy to global audiences anyway." [...] Keiichi Ishizaka, {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Warner Music Japan Inc, commenting on Kyary's image to The Japan Times, says [...] " [...] is a person who came directly out of Tokyo's Harajuku culture, and there is a growing international interest in Japan's kawaii culture," [...] Many critics and publications noted the increase of popularity within the Japanese popular culture outside Japan, such as its fashion and animation, and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu is serving as its global ambassador. Ishizaka believed that with the advent of the Internet, there is no difference in time and distance among countries anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{acknowledged}} {{the impact of}} folk on the song, saying [...] "I'd realized {{that a lot of}} what folk music is about taking a tradition and reflecting your own time. I knew my folk music would take off, if I put hip-hop beats behind it." [...] He had also perceived similarities between Delta blues and hip hop, which helped to inspire the song. The A.V. Club's Annie Zaleski opines that the song imitates abstract hip hop, while James Reed from The Boston Globe called it an alternative rock anthem, and Veronica Chambers for Vibe magazine described the song as a [...] "folk-based hip hop song." [...] "Loser" [...] revolves around several recurring musical elements: a slide guitar riff, Stephenson's sitar, the bassline, and a tremolo guitar part. The song's drum track is sampled from a Johnny Jenkins cover of Dr. John's [...] "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" [...] from the 1970 album Ton-Ton Macoute!. During the song's break, there is a sample of a line of dialogue from the 1994 Steve Hanft-directed film Kill the Moonlight, which goes [...] "I’m a driver/I’m a winner/Things are gonna change, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> it". Hanft and Beck were friends, and Hanft would go on to direct several music videos for Beck, including the video for [...] "Loser".|$|E
