40|$|AbstractThe {{basis for}} the altered DNA {{specificities}} of two Cre recombinase variants, obtained by mutation and selection, was revealed by their cocrystal structures. The proteins share similar substitutions but differ in their preferences for the natural LoxP substrate and an engineered substrate that is inactive with wild-type Cre, LoxM 7. One variant preferentially recombines LoxM 7 and contacts the substituted bases through a hydrated network of novel <b>interlocking</b> protein-DNA <b>contacts.</b> The other variant recognizes both LoxP and LoxM 7 utilizing the same DNA backbone contact but different base contacts, facilitated by an unexpected DNA shift. Assisted by water, novel interaction networks can arise from few protein substitutions, suggesting how new DNA binding specificities might evolve. The contributions of macromolecular plasticity and water networks in specific DNA recognition observed here present a challenge for predictive schemes...|$|R
40|$|Although zygospore (mature zygote) {{formation}} in P. blakeslleeanus occurs in liquid glucoseglutamate medium, morphological observations are made more easily when cultures are grown on 1 -mm-thick agar medium. Zygophores (sexually differentiated hyphae) develop prior to physical contact in crosses of (plus) and (minus) wild types. Zygophores <b>interlock</b> upon <b>contact</b> and then undergo six successive morphological changes {{to become a}} zygospore. Mutants with abnormal carotene synthesis exhibit aberrant sexual behavior. Some zygospores do form in crosses of carA mutants and wild types. Only paired zygophores form in crosses of wild type(plus) with car- 42 (minus), a beta-carotene-accumulating mutant. Zygophores form only on (minus) in crosses of wild type(plus) with carB(minus), carR(minus), carAcarR(minus), and carBcarR(minus) mutants, and only on (plus) in crosses of car- 43 (plus) with wild type(minus), car- 42 (minus), and carA(minus) mutants. Zygophores do not form in crosses of car- 43 (plus) with carB(minus), carR(minus), carAcarR(minus), and carBcarR(minus) mutants. These observations demonstrate that each mating type makes a chemical messenger that stimulates zygophore development in the opposite mating type...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new Multi-Circle Granule Model (MCGM), based on {{overlapping}} circles with various diameters {{to create an}} irregular particle shape, to simulate the geometry-dependent behavior of gravel particles for two-dimensional mechanical analyses of gravel deposits. The MCGM model is implemented in a Distinct Element Method (DEM) program for numerical simulation. Two numerical examples are presented to {{study the effects of}} gravel shapes on the angles of repose in free falling tests, and on the stability of gravel tunnel excavation in trap door tests. Additionally, the numerical study reveals that the shapes of gravel significantly affect the angle of repose. Furthermore, <b>interlocking,</b> anisotropy, and <b>contact</b> numbers among the Gravels are found to be key factors governing the stability of gravel tunnel excavation. These numerical simulation results of geometry-dependent behavior are quite encouraging for the MCGM model...|$|R
40|$|Diaspores of many higher plants, {{adapted to}} {{dispersal}} by attachment to animal fur and feathers, have evolved special structures providing mechanical interlocking or adhesion by glue. In this study, the contact separation {{force of a}} single structure, a burr, was used to characterise the attaching ability of the interlocking fruits in four plant species, Agrimonia eupatoria, Circaea lutetiana, Galium aparine, and Geum urbanum. The force that separated a single burr from <b>interlock,</b> the <b>contact</b> separation force of the burr, was measured. The morphological variables of burrs were estimated, and the dependence of the force on the size and the morphology of burrs was examined. The contact separation force of the burr significantly differed among species studied. It ranged from 3. 36 to 143. 85 mN. The increase of the force is positively correlated with burr length and burr diameter in the basal part. However. in C. lutetiana, the burrs experienced the lowest force, although the values of morphological burr variables were, intermediate, and the force applied did not cause the burr damage. In the three species studied, the fruits of which bear many burrs, the force was considerably lower than the fruit weight. To hold the fruit attached to the animal, the interlocking of several burrs (5 - 21 depending on the species) is required. Total force of all burrs covering the fruit exceeded the fruit weight by 4 - 20 times. This may increase the attachment force of the fruit, when more than the minimal burr number required are interlocked. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{investigated in}} this study was inspired by the anisotropic microornamentation of scales from the ventral body side of the California King Snake (Lampropeltis getula californiae). Frictional properties of snake-inspired microstructured polymer surface (SIMPS) made of epoxy resin were characterised in contact with a smooth glass ball by a microtribometer in two perpendicular directions. The SIMPS exhibited a considerable frictional anisotropy: Frictional coefficients measured along the microstructure were about 33 % lower than those measured in the opposite direction. Frictional coefficients were compared to those obtained on other types of surface microstructure: (i) smooth ones, (ii) rough ones, and (iii) ones with periodic groove-like microstructures of different dimensions. The results demonstrate the existence of a common pattern of interaction between two general effects that influence friction: (1) molecular interaction depending on real contact area and (2) the mechanical <b>interlocking</b> of both <b>contacting</b> surfaces. The strongest reduction of the frictional coefficient, compared to the smooth reference surface, was observed at a medium range of surface structure dimensions suggesting a trade-off between these two effects...|$|R
40|$|The joining of ceramic-metal {{can be done}} using {{different}} techniques such as brazing, diffusion bonding, and friction welding. However, the mechanism of ceramic-metal joining has still not been fully understood. In this study, an alumina rod was bonded to a mild steel rod via the friction welding technique by using an Al 1100 sheet as an interlayer. The diameters of the rods were both 10 mm, respectively. A friction pressure of 20 MPa and a forging pressure of 40 MPa were used. Rotational speed was maintained at 900 rpm and friction times from 2 to 20 s were applied. The joining strength was determined through a four point bending test. The maximum bending strength, 240 MPa was obtained when the friction time of 20 s was used. Under optical microscope and scanning electron microscope observation, the bonding aluminum interface was clearly obtained. Mechanical <b>interlocking</b> and close <b>contact</b> between the alumina-aluminum and aluminum-mild steel were observed at magnifications of 3000 Ã—. The strength of alumina-steel bonding is much dependent on the wettability of the alumina surface by the partially molten aluminum interlayer {{and the existence of}} mechanical interlocking between the interlayer and mild steel...|$|R

Indeed, the craft shop system used throughout its history made little differentiation between custom and standard products. High-end lighting designers regularly sought out Kliegl Brothers, who could design and produce the hardware that would fulfill their visions. Often, the custom product made its mark on the industry, such as the wall washers designed for the UN General Assembly room, or the fluorescent wall washers for New York's Pan American (now Met Life) building lobby, both designed by Herbert Kliegl. A custom oddity was the scoreboard designed for Madison Square Garden, across 50th Street from the factory.

40|$|One {{important}} {{concern in}} the design of a counter rotating turbine (CRT) is the structural vibration of the turbine components and its passive control by means of friction contacts in the joints whose design is a critical issue. A test campaign was performed on a simplified counter-rotating turbine stage. A test article which reproduces the dynamic behavior of a real CRT stage was purposely designed and constructed. The test article is composed of 24 segments, each one with 3 blades. As in the real case the segments are constrained at the outer radius and mounted with <b>interlocking</b> with friction <b>contacts</b> at the inner radius. The segments are connected to an outer ring by means of a double hook attachment with contact surfaces which can be characterized by sliding or sticking depending on the constraint which can be tight or loose. The tests were carried out with two aims: - evaluate the dynamic behavior and the vibration damping capability due to friction of the dummy CRT stage - produce experimental data in order to validate the numerical model of the non linear forced response of the test article. The calculation of the non linear forced response is performed in Matlab by reducing the Finite Element mass and stiffness matrices by means of a suitable reduction technique that is able to account for the cyclic symmetry of the rotor. Contact elements are located where the vane segment is expected to slip and different conditions for the hook attachment (tight or loose) and for the interlocking (slip or stick) are investigated in order to simulate the response of the test rig under different configurations. Harmonic Balance Method is used to reduce the calculation time requested by the iterative procedure. Sensitivity analysis of the parameters involved in the calculation is performed to verify the consistency of the mathematical approach and their effect on the dynamics of the CR turbine...|$|R
30|$|The role of {{the thermal}} {{stimulation}} is often unclear, and determining which mechanisms lead to observed injectivity increase is still challenging (Flores et al. 2005; Grant et al. 2013; HÃ©Ã°insdÃ³ttir 2014). Covell (2016) shows that thermal stimulation is driven by thermal contraction caused by the significant temperature difference between cold injection fluid and hot reservoir rock. The involved mechanisms lead to opening pre-existing discontinuities (contraction of discontinuity walls) or creating new ones. The thermal solicitation induces differential strains at the origin of thermo-mechanical stresses. When these stresses exceed the mechanical resistance of the rock, microcracks and failures could appear. Strains at {{the origin of this}} process can be mainly due to two causes: on the one hand, a thermal gradient in the rock mass, on the other hand, the heterogeneity of the grain contraction in the rock matrix. Because of this heterogeneity, two adjacent minerals can contract at different rates and this can generate uneven strains at the grain boundary (Wanne and Young 2008). In addition, petrographic characteristics (including grain size, grain shape, packing density, packing proximity, degree of <b>interlocking,</b> type of <b>contacts</b> and mineralogical composition) are known to affect mechanical properties (Ulusay et al. 1994). A critical review concerning DEM and its application to borehole stability was proposed by Kang et al. (2009). Santarelli et al. (1992) {{were among the first to}} study borehole stability using DEM. Yamamoto et al. (2002) used DEM to study the wellbore instability of laminated and fissured rocks. Karatela et al. (2016) studied the effect of in situ stress ratio and discontinuity orientation on borehole stability in heavily fractured rocks using DEM. DEM seems fairly adapted to take into account the physical phenomena at the granular phase level (micro scale), and to analyze their impact on the mechanical behavior of the near-wellbore zone (macro scale). We propose to implement this approach using the code Particle Flow Codeâ€” 2 Dimensions (PFC 2 D) (Itasca Consulting Group Inc. 2008 a, b), and to question the {{role of the}}rmal loadings in the wellbore. Chemical interaction of the drilling fluid may play a role in the thermal stimulation, for instance, through dissolution or precipitation of the minerals, triggered by temperature change. The quantification of these chemical effects in the specific context of IDDP- 2 remains a scientific challenge. Thus, in the absence of available data, indirect chemical effects of thermal stimulation are not considered in this study.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the reinforcing fibre and the matrix has {{a significant effect on}} the properties of the composite since the load distribution efficiency at the interface is determined by the degree of adhesion between the components. This strong fibre-matrix adhesion has to be obtained by interfacial interactions, including mechanical interlocking, chemical bonding and physical mechanisms of adhesion. Mechanical interlocking can have two opposing effects: promote or decrease adhesion. If the matrix is not able to fill irregularities at the fibre surface, the area of contact between the fibre and the matrix will be reduced, producing in turn a reduction in adhesion; on the other hand if the matrix can fully wet the rough surface, mechanical <b>interlocking</b> and increased <b>contact</b> area will lead to increased adhesion. Chemical adhesion will also depend on the degree of wetting, and it is formed across the interface if atoms of the fibre surface molecules can share electrons with matrix atoms, producing a very high bond strength. The molecules at the fibre surface are also able to interact with one another and with molecules from the matrix, without undergoing covalent bonding. The common procedure to evaluate these physical interactions is to estimate the composition of the fibre surface and the matrix in terms of surface energy components, utilising the results of contact angle measurements of probe liquids on both the fibre and the matrix in solid state at room temperature. However, {{there is a lack of}} information on how the interface is formed at high temperature between the molten thermoplastic and the hot fibre surface, and how high temperature affects the wetting behaviour of molten polymers during composite manufacturing. Direct contact angle measurements were performed of different molten thermoplastics, polypropylene (PP), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP) with different maleic anhydride content, on smooth glass fibres and smooth glass plates. The mechanical strength of the interfaces was assessed by single fibre pull-out tests. The matrices were selected as model systems for the investigation of the fibreâ€“matrix interface, based on the difference in surface energies between PP and PVDF and the effect of chemical bonding between PP and MAPP. In this way, physical and chemical adhesion were studied independently. The results correspond well to the predictions based on the calculation of the theoretical work of adhesion between the matrices and the fibre surfaces for PP and PVDF; however, the wetting behaviour of MAPP is affected by the MA content if compared with the surface energy analysis made at room temperature. The hypothesis is that the ring opening of the maleic anhydride group at high temperature leads to a strong increase in polarity of the polymer and thus to a lower contact angle with the glass surface. SEM, XPS, ToF-SIMS, and image analysis techniques were used for this study. status: accepte...|$|R
