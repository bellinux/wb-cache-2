2500|$|Up-tempo {{songs such as}} [...] "Phresh Out the Runway", [...] "Jump", and [...] "Pour It Up" [...] {{celebrate}} [...] hedonism. Much of the album's {{lyrics are}} presumably concerned with Rihanna's relationship with Chris Brown, with a second half of lighter songs that have references to a dysfunctional love life. The album's subject matter is reflected by an abundance of minor key sounds throughout its songs. James Reed of The Boston Globe called Unapologetic [...] "a defiant middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> critics, particularly the ones who don’t approve of her relationship with Brown." [...] Kot observed a [...] "celebrity subtext" [...] throughout the album and characterized the songs' narrators as [...] "troubled, anxiety-ridden, lost ... the characters in these songs linger in a limbo of mixed emotions, emotionally attracted to a lover and yet uneasy about the next step." [...] Spin magazine's Caryn Ganz wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings about her unapologetic love of" [...] money, love, and [...] "living in the moment" [...] on the songs [...] "Pour It Up", [...] "Loveeeeeee Song", and [...] "Right Now", respectively.|$|E
60|$|She {{looks at}} a door on {{the left of the}} hall, and puts a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lip.|$|E
60|$|They were alone: the Duke {{began again}} talking, and Miss Dacre put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mouth, with a smile.|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, as {{the door}} again opened. The old woman entered, {{carrying}} some clothes.|$|R
60|$|As {{she lay on}} {{her back}} she tried twice <b>to</b> raise <b>her</b> arm. The third time she got two thin <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit <b>to</b> Billy Jackson. <b>Her</b> arm fell back limply.|$|R
60|$|A {{smile that}} was {{distinctly}} mischievous still hovered round Madame's lips, but she forced <b>her</b> eyes <b>to</b> look grave: {{she held out}} the tips of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother and allowed him <b>to</b> lead <b>her</b> in the correct manner into the next room.|$|R
60|$|Steps shuffled {{along the}} corridor. I looked up sharply. She set a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips. There fell a knock, and old Busio stood before us.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the natives}} pointed with his thin <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> face, and whispered to the others. Meyer, who {{understood}} their tongue, caught the whisper. It was: ...|$|E
60|$|The girl put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips {{to impress}} silence, {{and the man}} nodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two {{children}} went on talking.|$|E
60|$|Maimie stamped {{her foot}} naughtily, and was putting <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{when she heard}} a kind voice say, 'Don't cry, pretty human, don't cry,' and then she turned round and saw a {{beautiful}} little naked boy regarding her wistfully. She knew at once {{that he must be}} Peter Pan.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later she saw him wading, and {{directly}} afterwards he stood upon the sands opposite <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> He waved his hand. She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips and threw him a kiss. He pretended not to notice, and started off toward the village, and her low laugh came floating {{to him in a}} momentary lull of the wind.|$|R
50|$|Supergran's {{most celebrated}} power is to hear (or 'receive') {{communications}} from long-distance {{if the person}} is distressed enough. To more clearly 'receive' the communication, Gudrun Ure developed an affectation holding <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead like horns or radio receivers. The director of the first episode liked it so much he suggested she keep it.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the {{mistress}} of the zenana came in. Rabda rose and put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips and left the room, accompanied by the woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, papa! There {{is no need}} {{to bring}} blushes on the cheeks of my dear ones, Martin Lambert!" [...] said the mother, putting her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's lips.|$|E
60|$|Alice {{opens the}} door, and sees Amy {{standing}} there with her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, just as they stood in all the five plays. Ginevra could not have posed her better.|$|E
60|$|Miss Cotton bent forward, and Mrs. Pasmer lifted <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> let <b>her</b> see {{the name}} of the book.|$|R
60|$|His <b>fingers</b> strayed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> pulse. He smiled {{upon her}} as one smiles upon a child.|$|R
60|$|The {{grandmother}} had now recovered her usual manners, {{and the whole}} family watched Deronda radiantly when he caressingly lifted the little girl, to whom he had not hitherto given attention, and seating her on the counter, asked for her name also. She {{looked at him in}} silence, and put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> gold earrings, which he did not seem to have noticed.|$|R
60|$|She put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lip, with {{whatever}} warning intention, {{and followed her}} husband into {{the presence of the}} actor, and almost into his arms, so rapturous was the meeting between them.|$|E
60|$|Curtis came to {{the door}} again and tapped. She put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, and so he stood silent, looking in at her. His eyes called her and she rose and tiptoed to the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw a Heppelwhite couch once"--Sophie {{laid her}} <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> flushed cheek and considered. [...] "With, two of them--one on each side--you wouldn't need {{anything}} else. Except--there {{must be one}} perfect mirror over that mantelpiece." ...|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, {{and threw}} a world of unutterable and enigmatical meaning into her mischievous face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yassir. When I comed {{here from}} Caroliny de Mistis done tole me not ter let er soul in hyah. One day erbout three mont's ergo, dis yer lady come en she des wheedled me ter let her in. She was de quality, Marse Dave, and I was des' afeard not ter. I declar' I hatter. Hush," [...] said Lindy, putting <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, [...] "dar's de Mistis!" ...|$|R
40|$|The plane passed {{very low}} above {{the street and}} Trina put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ears. She always did that. It was a natural {{reaction}} against the noise, threatening to {{be a violation of}} some sort of auditory balance. It passed and the world got mostly quiet again, just a faint roar of the machine in the distance, disappearing southwards in grey clouds somewhere where the sea evaporates into the sky. </p...|$|R
6000|$|There she was, {{seated at}} the bedside, smiling quietly and lifting her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips! As {{certainly}} as I saw the familiar objects in the room, and the prostrate figure on the bed, I saw--Madame Fontaine! ...|$|E
60|$|She put a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, {{with a quick}} {{peremptory}} {{gesture to}} Dion, then she recrossed the studio with a firm step and the curtains of the inner door fell back behind her with a swish.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{blue eyes}} met his own with quick {{intelligence}} and {{no trace of}} her former timidity. A soft, caressing light had taken its place. Pointing with her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> breast in a childlike gesture, she said, [...] "Me--Olooya." ...|$|E
60|$|So he is gloomily borne {{off to the}} Lumps-of-Delight shop, where Rosa {{makes her}} purchase, and, after {{offering}} some to him (which he rather indignantly declines), begins to partake of it with great zest: previously taking off and rolling {{up a pair of}} little pink gloves, like rose-leaves, and occasionally putting <b>her</b> little pink <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> rosy lips, <b>to</b> cleanse them from the Dust of Delight that comes off the Lumps.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned down}} the latch and drew the bolt. The sound seemed <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> a little courage. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> went <b>to</b> <b>her</b> throat for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{strength}} in that thumb and <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> a sharp fierce shake, {{and the low}} voice that said [...] "Dora" [...] was like the lion's growl.|$|R
6000|$|Florida noiselessly {{opened the}} door, and met the servant {{with a tray}} of coffee. She put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lip, and motioned her not to enter, asking in a whisper: [...] "What time is it, Nina? I forgot to wind my watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|Safely {{inside the}} door she turned, and with a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips, a roguish light in her eyes, she said: [...] "I {{want to tell you}} something. I can't wait any longer. Enid's Choice ran to the {{capacity}} of the house last week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Claudie, dear," [...] said she, {{touching}} her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ruby tongue and testing the unresponsive curling irons, [...] "you do me an injustice. Mme. Toinette {{has not seen}} a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Hunterleys shivered. She {{had drawn}} {{a little closer}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband. Her coat was unfastened. Hunterleys leaned towards her and buttoned it with strong <b>fingers</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> throat.|$|R
50|$|Secretly {{pleased with}} the turn of events, Dione is escorted to Sandra Benes' {{quarters}} to rest. Sandra then goes for refreshments. At Koenig's orders, there are guards outside the locked door and the Bethan woman is left without the means to trigger the commlock panel. When certain she is alone, Dione puts <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> temples, concentrates, and dematerialises. When she is discovered missing, a search commences—until the lift-off of the Bethan escape pod reveals Dione's whereabouts.|$|R
60|$|Gilda {{looked out}} and listened--unable to {{understand}} this vague sense of oppression and of foreboding: when she put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eyes, she found them wet with tears.|$|R
