5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Ferret-legging was an {{endurance}} test or stunt in which ferrets {{were trapped in}} trousers worn by a participant. Also known as put 'em down and ferret-down-trousers, {{it seems to have}} been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|E

5|$|Mary Steen (1856–1939) was a {{successful}} photographer in Copenhagen, pioneering indoor photography with pictures of families <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> own homes. Later, as court photographer, she not only photographed the royal family in Denmark but also {{spent some time in}} London where she photographed Queen Victoria. She did much to improve working conditions for women and her example encouraged many women to become professional photographers.|$|E
5|$|Property {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $150,000–200,000. All of the film in the facility was destroyed; more than 40,000 reels of negatives and film prints burned to ashes <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> film cans. Fifty-seven truckloads of burned film were hauled from the site to have their silver content extracted. Each can contained about five cents' worth of silver; the salvaged metal returned $2,000.|$|E
5|$|The female usually {{attaches}} the egg {{case to a}} substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or {{carries it}} about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.|$|E

5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the game}} was {{available}} either as a standalone packaged game, {{or as part of}} a special pack, which included one of only 25,000 limited edition, Zelda-themed Game Boy Advance SP. The Triforce SP is matte gold in color, with a Triforce logo stamped on the lid, and the Hyrule royal family crest printed on the lower right face. As a launch promotion, Nintendo Europe also produced seven 24-carat gold plated Game Boy Advance SP consoles, with six given away to people who found a golden ticket <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> Triforce SP package, and a seventh as a magazine promotion. Thirty were autographed by Miyamoto himself {{at the opening of the}} Nintendo World Store in New York.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1868, {{parties of}} Paraguayans in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded Brazilian ironclads {{anchored}} in Tayí. The imperiled vessels dispatched a boat to warn Inhaúma, who was aboard the flagship Brasil downriver at Elisiário Port. By {{the time he}} arrived, the Brazilians had locked themselves <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> ships and the Paraguayans had taken control of the decks. Inhaúma ordered the Brasil and two other vessels to open fire, decimating the Paraguayans and saving the ironclads. A day later he was raised from baron to viscount by Pedro II. On 25 July, the allies occupied Humaitá after the Paraguayans had abandoned it and retreated further upriver.|$|E

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana on January 3, 2005. The game's early going was marked by defense and field goals. Virginia Tech didn't score in the first half, and Auburn managed just threefield goals, {{including}} one taken inside the Virginia Tech red zone after Auburn failed to score a touchdown from the Tech one-yard line. Tech also {{had a chance to}} score a touchdown from <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> opponent's one-yard line, but like Auburn, failed to do so. The Hokies elected to try for a touchdown rather than a field goal on fourth down, but were stopped. At halftime, Auburn had a 9–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E
50|$|Burning Inside was an American death metal band {{formed by}} ex-members of various other groups. It {{was formed in}} 1995 by Steve Childers and Richard Christy. They soon added Jamie Prim. Michael Estes joined in 1996. In 2000, Burning <b>Inside</b> {{released}} <b>their</b> first album, The Eve of the Entities. In 2001, Burning <b>Inside</b> released <b>their</b> second album, Apparition. The band released their final self-titled album in September 2007, which was independently released through online music stores, as the band were no longer signed to any label.|$|R

The only {{surviving}} member of June and Nevill's immediate family was their adoptive son, Jeremy Bamber, then 24 years old, who said he had been at home a few miles away when the shooting took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were designed by Bob Thomas, whereas the code was written by Dave Thomas. The Thomas brothers decided to show their progress {{of the game}} to Tim and Chris Stamper for evaluation, despite feeling embarrassed due to their workspace being <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> parents' attic. Impressed by the game, the Stamper brothers commissioned an entire series to be released for the Commodore 64. Dave Thomas recalled that every game they produced was met with little interference from Ultimate; once a game was complete, it {{would be sent to}} quality assessment and subsequently published for release.|$|E
5|$|The next day, June 25, Black Hawk's party {{encountered}} a militia battalion commanded by Major John Dement. In the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk's warriors drove the militiamen <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> fort and commenced a two-hour siege. After losing nine warriors and killing five militiamen, Black Hawk broke off the siege {{and returned to}} his main camp at Lake Koshkonong. This would prove to be Black Hawk's last military success in the war. With his band running low on food, he decided to take them back across the Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a {{crowd of}} about 100 journalists, supporters, and friends who had {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls <b>inside</b> <b>their</b> mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
