40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe advent of multi-programming and {{the proliferation of}} shared computer systems has increased the need for greater computer security. Computer security can be segmented into six categories: physical, hardware, software, personnel, communications and procedures. Embedded into software security are those features which protect the system against both unauthorized access and denial of service to authorized users. Another term for this is access control. Access control mechanisms verify an individual's identity via three distinct methods: 1) something an individual knows, 2) something an individual possesses or 3) something about the individual. One device which keys on something about the individual is a retinal scan system. This system utilizes the retinal blood vessel pattern as a unique identifier. This thesis studies one such retinal pattern recognition device. For the purposes of this study, an experiment was designed and conducted which determined the reliability of this system as a function of various tolerance levels, as well as its applicability as a computer systems access control mechanism. The Eye <b>Dentify</b> 7. 5 system by Eye <b>Dentify</b> Inc., of Portland, Oregon, proved to be a fairly expensive, highly reliable access control device.

According to the model, more credit to the private sector makes output less sensitive to productivity shocks. Thus, the amplification role of credit frictions in the propagation of productivity shocks to output is greater in economies with higher degrees of credit rationing. I confront the prediction of the model with a panel of OECD countries over the last 20 years.

40|$|Detrended {{fluctuation}} analysis (DFA) [1] of {{the volatility}} series {{has been found}} to be useful in <b>dentifying</b> possible nonlinear/multifractal dynamics in the empirical sample [2 - 4]. Long-range volatile correlation can be an outcome of static as well as dynamical nonlinearity. In order to argue in favor of dynamical nonlinearity, surrogate testing is used in conjunction with volatility analysis [2 - 4]. In this brief communication, surrogate testing of volatility series from long-range correlated noise and their static, invertible nonlinear transforms is investigated. Long-range correlated monofractal noise is generated using FARIMA (0, d, 0) with Gaussian and non-Gaussian innovations. We show significant deviation in the scaling behavior between the empirical sample and the surrogate counterpart at large time-scales in the case of FARIMA (0, d, 0) with non-Gaussian innovations whereas no such discrepancy was observed in the case of Gaussian innovations. The results encourage cautious interpretation of surrogate testing in the presence of non-Gaussian innovations. Comment: 13 Pages, 3 Figure...|$|R
