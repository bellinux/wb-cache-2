A signal was given, and all awaited in breathless silence the answer. Presently they heard the wash of the water caused by the movement of a gondola beneath the window. Stepping forward again, Don Camillo dropped the paper with such precision that he distinctly heard the fall of the coin {{in the bottom of the}} boat. The gondolier scarce raised his eyes to the balcony, but commencing an air much used on the canals, he swept onward, like one whose duty called for no haste.|$|E
6000|$|John Caldigate was committed, and liberated on bail. This {{occurred}} in Cambridge on the Wednesday after the christening; {{and before the}} Saturday night following, all the Boltons were thoroughly convinced that this wretched man, who had taken from them their daughter and their sister, was a bigamist, and that poor Hester, though a mother, was not a wife. The evidence against him, already named, was very strong, but they had been put in possession of other, and as they thought more damning evidence than any {{to which he had}} alluded in telling his version of the story to Robert Bolton. The woman had produced, and had shown to Robert Bolton, the <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> addressed in John Caldigate's handwriting to 'Mrs. Caldigate, Ahalala, Nobble,' which letter had been dated inside from Sydney, and which envelope bore the Sydney postmark. Caldigate's handwriting was peculiar, and the attorney declared that he could himself swear to it. The letter itself she also produced, but it told less than the envelope. It began as such a letter might begin, 'Dearest Feemy,' and ended 'Yours, ever and always, J.C.' As she herself had pointed out, a man such as Caldigate does not usually call his wife by that most cherished name in writing to her. The letter itself referred almost altogether to money matters, though perhaps hardly to such as a man generally discusses with his wife. Certain phrases seemed to imply a distinct action. She had better sell these shares or those, if she could, for a certain price,--and suchlike. But she explained, that they both when they married had been possessed of mining shares, represented by scrip which passed from hand to hand readily, and that each still retained his or her own property. But among the various small documents which she had treasured up for use, should they be needed for some possible occasion such as this, was a note, which had not, indeed, been posted, but which purported to have been written by the minister, Allan, to Caldigate himself, offering to perform the marriage at Ahalala, but advising him to have the ceremony performed at some more settled place, where an established church community with a permanent church or chapel admitted the proper custody of registers. Nothing could be more sensible, or written in a better spirit than this letter, though the language was not that of an educated man. This letter, Caldigate had, she said, showed to her, and she had retained it. Then she brought forward two handkerchiefs which she herself had marked with her new name, Euphemia Caldigate, and the date of the year. This had been done, she declared, immediately after her marriage, and the handkerchiefs seemed by their appearance to justify the assertion. Caldigate had admitted a promise, admitted that he had lived with the woman, admitted that she had passed by his name, admitted {{that there had been a}} conversation with the clergyman in regard to his marriage. And now there were three others, besides the woman herself, who were ready to swear,--who had sworn,--that they had witnessed the ceremony! ...|$|E
40|$|We have mapped the CO(3 - 2) line {{emission}} {{around the}} Mira AB system at 0. 5 resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The CO map shows amazing complexity. The circumstellar gas {{has been shaped}} by different dynamical actors during {{the evolution of the}} system and several morphological components can be identified. The companion is marginally resolved in continuum emission and is currently at 0. 487 ± 0. 006 separation. In the main line component, centered on the stellar velocity, spiral arcs around Mira A are found. The spiral appears to be relatively flat and oriented in the orbital plane. An accretion wake behind the companion is clearly visible and the projected arc separation is of order 5 ". In the blue wing of the line emission, offset from the main line, several large (∼ 5 - 10 "), opposing arcs are found.

In this letter dated November 10, 1933, Iwai calls the inkstone "Shumisen Kenboku," or the Inkstone of Mount Sumeru, presumably because it resembles the shape of the legendary mountain. This inkstone is worth much attention as its inscription was made in 'Phags-pa script, and represents a rare example of 'Phags-pa stationery. Since most 'Phags-pa material is of an official nature, the value of the inkstone is high despite the fact that its whereabouts is unknown, and the only trace of the object is through the rubbing. In seeking information on the inkstone, it is discovered that Naito saw the object much earlier than the date of the letter, and had earlier tried to send a transcription of the inscription in a letter addressed to Takakusu Junjiro (1866 ‒ 1945), which is included in Naito's Complete Works. This paper describes the historical background of Naito's academic interests in historical materials and presents a deciphering of the 'Phags-pa inscription, an estimation of its value, and date of creation...|$|E

The Weimar letters include those in which Liszt addressed (in French) Ignaz Moscheles and Julius Benedict, both German musicians living in London, about his 1840 concert tour in England. Also, he wrote in French to singer Pauline Viardot-Garcìa, Madame Érard, and his Neapolitan pupil Luisa Cognetti. His letters in German to Hermann Levi deal with Richard Wagner. In another letter Liszt is asking the Vienna Home Secretary Baron Alexander von Bach, to have his Gran Mass published at the state administration’s expense. His letters to Count Sándor Teleki and Ede Reményi concern Hungarian musical life. Liszt is giving instructions for the publishing of his work Hymne de l’enfant à son réveil to his Hungarian publisher Nándor Táborszky and writing a dry refusal to his former Hungarian pupil Sándor Bertha.

40|$|Silenciosamente, alguns materiais cromáticos omitem qualidades potentes. Um simples olhar mais demorado pode ativá- -las. Outras vezes, é necessário o envolvimento de todo o corpo, numa relação de aproximação e convivência, para que o potencial se apresente. O pau-brasil - ou ibirapitanga, como denominada pelos indígenas - é uma árvore cujo cerne do tronco possui uma matéria orgânica, a brasilina, que produz cor, primeiro por entrar em contato com o oxigênio, depois por outros processos químicos. Uma cor? Não, diversas, a depender do {{modus operandi}} das ações e reações escolhidas. Essas cores podem ser fixadas e ter certa permanência quando usadas como corante para têxteis e papéis ou como pigmento em diferentes suportes. Por quanto tempo? Segundo os especialistas em tingimento, não muito. Numa perspectiva histórica, a ibirapitanga foi apreciada e utilizada como corante por conta de uma herança cultural: o gosto pelo púrpura e pelo carmim, tonalidades adoradas pelos povos antigos. Sua exploração no território brasileiro se deu de maneira agressiva, conflituosa e cheia de contradições a partir do éncontro,́ não apenas do homem com o material, mas de homens com homens, quando os navegantes europeus do século xvi fizeram as primeiras viagens para a América do Sul e entraram em contato com os povos locais. O estudo de documentos antigos, o toque no papel amarelado dessas publicações e o abrir o {{envelope}} de uma carta assinada pelo rei numa biblioteca em Lisboa adensaram o conteúdo teórico desta pesquisa, assim como contribuíram enquanto dado sensorial e imagético. De fato, resquícios do corante do pau-brasil em pinturas ou tecidos de acervos históricos não foram encontrados presencialmente apesar das tentativas. Foi somente a partir da reprodução de receitas, com as necessárias adaptações ao contexto contemporâneo, e dos desdobramentos destes experimentos em outros processos análogos, que o sentido da investigação poética se deu. Produzir cor com uso da ibirapitanga foi o centro das experimentações em ateliê. Como podemos atualizar a presença desse material cromático hoje? Foi por meio de diversas leituras, dos processos práticos no ateliê e de importantes conversas que o conteúdo da pesquisa ganhou sentido e se tornou possível estruturar este texto, que contém um breve histórico do pau-brasil, um caderno de receitas e a produção poética com o uso da ibirapitanga. Selecionamos ainda quatro conversas relevantes para a atualização do tema: a primeira realizada com Ana Cristina de Siqueira Lima, presidente da Funbrasil - Fundação Nacional do Pau-Brasil, que realiza ações de preservação da espécie; a segunda, com Eva Eis, pesquisadora e técnica em restauro da Universidade Técnica de Munique (tum), que desenvolve no momento pesquisa acerca de receitas de pigmentos de pau-brasil e que trabalha na fábrica Kremer Pigmente; com o artista Carlos Vergara, que se utiliza de materiais naturais para a produção de suas telas, valendo-se da monotipia e outros processos para revelar a presença da cor; e com a pintora e escultura Amelia Toledo, que evidencia sutis diferenças cromáticas enquanto matéria construtiva e propositiva de suas obras de arte. Esta publicação é fruto destes e de outros encontros que aconteceram nos últimos anos, e, por meio de diferentes materiais, tonalidades e palavras, celebra de maneira ambivalente (já que tratamos da ibirapitanga e sua memória de ásperos conflitos) essas aproximações, que imprimem e deixam seus rastros. Silently, some chromatic materials omit powerful qualities. A simple, longer look may activate them. In other situations, {{the involvement of}} the whole body is necessary, in a closer relationship, during some days or weeks, for the potential to present itself. The brazilwood - or ibirapitanga, as it was called by the natives - is a tree which has a heartwood with an organic material, the brazilin. It produces colour, first by coming into contact with oxygen, then by other chemical processes. One colour? No, several, depending on the modus operandi, the actions and reactions that are chosen. Colours that can be fixed and have certain permanence when used as a dye for textiles and papers, or as pigment in different supports. How long? According to experts in dyeing techniques, not much. Ibirapitanga was appreciated and used as a dye because it produces purple and carmine. Historically, ancient peoples adored those colours. The exploration of ibirapitanga in the Brazilian territory took place in an aggressive, conflictive way, full of contradictions from the ḿeetingńot only of men with this material, but of men with men: when European navigators of the sixteenth century made the first voyages to South America and came into contact with local people. The study of ancient documents, the touch on the yellowish papers of those publications and the opening of the <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> signed by the king, in a library in Lisbon, added theoretical content to this research and contributed as sensorial and imaginary data. In fact, we could not find and see residues of brazilwood in paintings or fabrics from historical collections, despite the attempts. It was only from the reproduction of recipes - with the necessary adaptations to the contemporary context - and from the development of these experiments in other similar processes, that the meaning of poetic investigation occurred. Producing colour with the use of ibirapitanga was the centre of experimentation in the atelier. How can we update the presence of this chromatic material today? It was through reading, practical processes in the atelier and through important conversations that the content of this research made sense and it became possible to structure this text, which contains a brief chapter about the history of brazilwood, a recipe book and the poetic production with the use of ibirapitanga. We selected four relevant conversations to update the subject: the first one held with Ana Cristina de Siqueira Lima, president of Funbrasil - Brazilwood National Foundation, which works to preserve the species; the second, with Eva Eis, researcher and restoration technician at the Technical University of Munich (tum), who is currently developing studies on the production of brazilwood lake pigments and works at the Kremer Pigment factory; with the artist Carlos Vergara, who uses natural materials for the production of his paintings, using monotype prints and other processes to reveal the presence of colour; and with the painter and sculptor Amelia Toledo, who shows delicate chromatic differences as constructive material and as a purpose of her art. This publication is the result of these and other meetings that have taken place in the last years, and, through different materials, shades and words, celebrates in an ambivalent way (since we are talking about ibirapitanga and its memory of conflicts) the approximations, which imprint and leave traces...|$|E
