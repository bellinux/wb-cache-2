The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{provides}} {{the results of}} a study involving activities on reducing noise through the use of multichamber combined aerodynamic silencers in <b>industrial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners.</b> The topicality of this work is associated with the fact that in using <b>industrial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> noise levels prescribed by GOST 12. 1. 003 - 83 [1] are exceeded. For instance, the acoustic characteristics of T- 1 and NPP- 2 [7, 8] <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> do not correspond to normative requirements at a rotational speed of n= 3000 rpm and a component density of q = 0, 01 pcs/m 2 [1]. Note that exceeded sound pressure levels are observed mainly in high-frequency areas (1000 [...] . 8000 Hz) and is about 7 [...] . 10 dB. As the first version, the study tested a multichamber reactive silencer serially installed on an NPP- 2 <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> [8], and as the second version, the study tried a new multichamber silencer [13], wherein the interior is worked by a noise absorber with a thickness of 10 mm.

25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899.

5000|$|A laser guide {{provides}} a precise visual indication {{of where the}} cut will be positioned on the workpiece in the current configuration. Some models provide a single reference line for {{one side of the}} kerf, while others provide two lines to reflect the total kerf width. A blade guard is a cover for the teeth of the cutting blade. Most modern miter saws have self-retracting blade guards, which automatically retract when the saw is lowered onto a workpiece and re-cover the blade when the saw is raised. It is very dangerous to use the saw if these guards are removed or damaged. A dust bag connects directly to the saw, and helps to collect sawdust away from the workpiece during cutting. Optionally, many manufacturers sell adapters to connect an <b>industrial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in lieu of a bag to capture more of the dust and simplify disposal. Dust removal with these saws is notoriously poor. A safety clamp helps to lock a workpiece into position prior to making a cut. This is an especially important feature when cutting smaller workpieces (eight inches or smaller). The miter table [...] is typically less than 24" [...] in diameter. Typically, the work will need to be supported on the far end to stabilize the piece while cutting.|$|E

30|$|We {{extracted}} shrub {{seeds from}} the duff and soil samples collected in 1987 using procedures modified {{from those of}} Quick (1956). After air drying, we sieved the samples, retaining the 1.0 mm to 4.8 mm fraction. We discarded material < 1.0 mm, which was assumed not to contain shrub seeds. Material larger than 4.8 mm was first examined for the occasional cluster of Arctostaphylos seed still attached to the raceme before discarding. We then removed seed from the retained fraction using a mechanical seed aspirator that consisted of an <b>industrial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> mesh screens, {{and a series of}} Plexiglas® (Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) tubes, which separated the lighter organic particles from the seed. We conducted tests with known amounts of seed placed within soil and duff samples that showed that nearly all fully developed and potentially viable shrub seeds could be extracted using this method. We assessed potential viability of all seeds collected in 1987 and a subset of seeds collected in 1988 by cutting them in half and visually examining them for an intact healthy endosperm.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{is shown}} that dust content of urban {{environment}} affects the morbidity rate. The study of dispersive soil (loessial and clay rocks) dust emission has been undertaken, 60 % of {{such kind of}} soil are involved in earthworks in the Nizhnee Povolzhie region. It has been revealed {{that the nature of}} dust emission in the development of dispersive solid depends on the physical and mechanical properties (moisture, porosity, plasticity indices) and the depth of development. Dust emissions are allocated in the depth zone. The relationship between dust emission in loessial rocks and the composition of the underlying stratum deposits has been noted. If the loessial stratum covers the clay soil, during the development it leads to a smaller release of dust than when bedding on sandy rocks. Clay development is characterized by low dust emission figures; they depend on the variability of properties at different depth. It has been found that properties of rocks in the walls of borrows and grooves change over time. We have described the working principle and the main constituent elements of <b>industrial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> which is recommended to be used for cleaning pollutants that have accumulated after the construction work, during the development of dispersive soil, on city streets, in dead zones of joints of horizontal and vertical planes...|$|E
