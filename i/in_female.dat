5|$|In a {{study of}} risk taking, some types of risk, such as {{physical}} or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking by male friends, but preferred less of it <b>in</b> <b>female</b> mates. Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it <b>in</b> <b>female</b> friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic risk taking by male friends {{as they could be}} good allies.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels <b>in</b> <b>female</b> peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome <b>in</b> <b>female</b> mammals and inactivates it.|$|E

40|$|Dosage {{compensation}} in Drosophila is {{the mechanism}} by which X-linked gene expression is made equal <b>in</b> males and <b>females.</b> Proper regulation {{of this process is}} critical to the survival of both sexes. Males must turn the male-specific lethal (msl) -mediated pathway of dosage compensation on and females must keep it off. The msl 2 gene is the primary target of negative regulation <b>in</b> <b>females.</b> Preventing production of MSL 2 protein is sufficient to prevent dosage compensation; however, ectopic expression of MSL 2 protein <b>in</b> <b>females</b> is not sufficient to induce an insurmountable level of dosage compensation, suggesting that an additional component is limiting <b>in</b> <b>females.</b> A candidate for this limiting factor is MSL 1, because the amount of MSL 1 protein <b>in</b> <b>females</b> is reduced compared to males. We have identified two levels of negative regulation of msl 1 <b>in</b> <b>females.</b> The predominant regulation is at the level of protein stability, while a second regulatory mechanism functions at the level of protein synthesis.

5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior.

This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase <b>in</b> <b>female</b> population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E

5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous <b>in</b> <b>female</b> equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
