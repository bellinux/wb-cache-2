40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} propose a novel decentralised robust routing control {{strategy}} for average and covariance of queue length <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>network.</b> The {{objective is to}} control the transitional behaviour of the data networks in response to new traffic load. For each node, the authors design a local state feedback controller based on minimising the worst case of the queue length. The authors then propose an innovative model for covariance of the queue length in each node. To control the average of queue length, local delay-dependent robust controllers are designed based on an equivalent descriptor representation and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). For covariance control of the queue length, the authors first show that the covariance control problem is equivalent to a standard disturbance rejection problem. Then the authors propose a covariance feedback control law. To investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methodology an example is also presented and extensive simulation results are conducted.

We then propose two off-line Traffic Engineering methodologies for IP intra-domain network: the first one is based on an IGP/MPLS architecture; the second one is based only on the IGP routing using an optimized load balancing scheme.

40|$|Spread ALOHA is a {{multiple}} access protocol using conventional ALOHA packets spread in time, {{so that the}} packet contention interval at {{the output of the}} packet receiver is not increased. Packets transmitted using a Spread ALOHA protocol can overlap in the physical channel with high probability, but still be separated at the output of a matched filter, so that the probability of overlap at the receiver output is low. Spread ALOHA operation of a data channel combines several characteristics of ALOHA channels and Spread Spectrum channels. The use of Spread ALOHA can achieve certain efficiencies and simplicities of operation which are not possible in conventional ALOHA channels or conventional Spread Spectrum channels.
