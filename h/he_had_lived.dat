5|$|In her 1953 novel Graham {{suggests}} that Point du Sable left Chicago {{because he was}} angered with the United States government, which wanted him to buy the land on which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> and called his own for the previous two decades. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville and the subsequent westward migration of Indians away from the Chicago area might also have influenced his decision.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Loper worked for Washington Associates, a Washington, DC, {{consulting}} firm. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Bozman, Maryland, for 28 years.

5|$|Prokofiev {{died at the}} age of 61 on 5 March 1953, {{the same}} day as Joseph Stalin. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> near Red Square, and for three days the throngs {{gathered}} to mourn Stalin, making it impossible to carry Prokofiev's body out for the funeral service at the headquarters of the Soviet Composers' Union.

5|$|The {{timing of}} Frederick's {{death and the}} length of his reign are {{important}} topics among historians. The premature demise of Frederick III is considered a potential turning point in German history; and whether or not he would have made the Empire more liberal if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> longer is still discussed.|$|E

He died in the German city of Kassel, after suffering liver failure. He was buried in Switzerland, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> since the early 1930s. He is remembered {{as one of the}} greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers, a perfectionist who excelled in all conditions. His record of six German Grand Prix wins remains unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|Aventicum (Avenches) {{was likely}} {{the capital of}} the Helvetii since its {{founding}} {{at the beginning of the}} 1st century. In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the St Bernard pass over a street expanded by Claudius, and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of Vespasian for the city in which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> for a time, or a measure to better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting a colony of veterans in their midst.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived.</b> The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, Fletcher filed {{a lawsuit}} against the Board of Directors of The Dakota co-op {{building}} in Manhattan, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> since 1992 and owned four apartments. Among other things, he alleged defamation and unlawful discrimination. In March 2010, Fletcher had signed a contract to purchase a fifth apartment at The Dakota, intending to combine it with his current home. The Dakota board said it rejected Fletcher's application based on the financial materials he provided in his application. Judge Eileen A. Rakower dismissed the suit in September 2015 and Fletcher announced his intention to appeal.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E

5|$|Edward VIII did {{not spend}} much of his reign at Windsor Castle. He {{continued}} {{to spend most of}} his time at Fort Belvedere in the Great Park, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> whilst Prince of Wales. Edward created a small aerodrome at the castle on Smith's Lawn, now used as a golf-course. Edward's reign was short-lived and he broadcast his abdication speech to the British Empire from the castle in December 1936, adopting the title of Duke of Windsor. His successor, George VI also preferred his own original home, the Royal Lodge in the Great Park, but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife Elizabeth. As king, George revived the annual Garter Service at Windsor, drawing on the accounts of the 17th-century ceremonies recorded by Elias Ashmole, but moving the event to Ascot Week in June.|$|E
5|$|In 1447 {{the local}} painter's guild elected Lochner as their {{representative}} municipal councilor, or Ratsherr. The appointment implies that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Cologne {{since at least}} 1437, as only {{those who had been}} living in the city for ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to avoid paying the 12 guilder fee. He was obliged to act as Ratsherr, and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51, but died in office.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> {{long enough to see}} his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
