5|$|The United Nations ranks India as a middle-income country. Findings {{from the}} World Economic Forum {{indicate}} that India {{is one of}} the worst countries in the world in terms of gender <b>inequality.</b> The 2011 United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms of gender <b>inequality.</b> The value of this multidimensional indicator, Gender <b>Inequality</b> Index (GII) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate, adolescent fertility rate, educational achievement and labour force participation rate. Gender <b>inequality</b> in India is exemplified by women’s lower likelihood of being literate, continuing their education and participating in the labour force.|$|E
5|$|Periyar was {{a radical}} {{advocate}} of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Brahmanism is accepting social <b>inequality</b> based on birth. Even a non-Brahmin who supports <b>inequality</b> based on caste {{was seen as}} a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.|$|E
5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender <b>inequality</b> calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of <b>inequality,</b> SIGI is able to penalize high levels of <b>inequality</b> {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender <b>inequality</b> in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E

The journal accepts high quality papers containing original research results and survey articles of exceptional merit. Subject matters should be strongly related to <b>inequalities,</b> such as, but not restricted to, the following: <b>Inequalities</b> in Analysis, <b>Inequalities</b> in Approximation theory, <b>Inequalities</b> in Combinatorics, <b>Inequalities</b> in Economics, <b>Inequalities</b> in Geometry, <b>Inequalities</b> in Mechanics, <b>Inequalities</b> in Optimization, <b>Inequalities</b> in Stochastic Analysis and Applications.|$|R

5|$|This <b>inequality</b> further {{offended}} {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this <b>inequality</b> {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
25|$|The {{major factor}} of housing <b>inequality</b> is {{economic}} <b>inequality.</b> Theses two different social <b>inequality</b> are the vicious circle to each other.

25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that {{economic}} <b>inequality</b> invariably translates to political <b>inequality,</b> which further aggravates the problem.

Firstly, the direct reverse weighted arithmetic-harmonic mean <b>inequalities</b> for scalars are obtained.

25|$|Housing <b>inequality</b> is the {{difference}} in the quality of housing that exists within a given society. It is a form of economic <b>inequality.</b> The right to housing is a recognized right by many national constitutions and the lack of adequate housing can have adverse consequences for the options available to an individual or family. The term may apply regionally across a geographic space, temporally between one generation and the next, or culturally between groups of different racial or social backgrounds. Housing <b>inequality</b> is directly related to concepts of racial <b>inequality,</b> social <b>inequality,</b> income <b>inequality,</b> and wealth <b>inequality.</b> It is often the result of factors including natural market forces, housing discrimination, and housing segregation.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we derive new {{families}} of piecewise linear facet-defining <b>inequalities</b> for the finite group problem and extreme <b>inequalities</b> for the infinite group problem using approximate lifting. The new valid <b>inequalities</b> for the finite group problem are two- and three-slope facet-defining <b>inequalities</b> {{as well as}} the first family of four-slope facet-defining <b>inequalities.</b> The new valid <b>inequalities</b> for the infinite group problem are {{families of}} two- and three-slope extreme <b>inequalities,</b> including nontrivial <b>inequalities</b> that are not continuous. These new <b>inequalities</b> not only illustrate the diversity of strong <b>inequalities</b> for the finite and infinite group problems, but also provide a large variety of new cutting planes for solving integer and mixed-integer programming problems. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the 0 / 1 {{knapsack}} polytope. In particular, we introduce the class of weight <b>inequalities.</b> This class of <b>inequalities</b> is needed to describe the knapsack polyhedron when the weights of the items lie in certain intervals. A generalization of weight <b>inequalities</b> yields the so-called "weight-reduction principle" and the class of extended weight <b>inequalities.</b> The latter class of <b>inequalities</b> includes minimal cover and (1, k) -configuration <b>inequalities.</b> The properties of lifted minimal cover <b>inequalities</b> are extended to this general class of <b>inequalities.</b> ...|$|R

Because of this, Dobson and Ramlogan suggest that perhaps trade openness {{can be related to}} <b>inequality</b> through a Kuznets curve framework.|$|E
