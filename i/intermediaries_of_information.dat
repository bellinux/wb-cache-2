Utilizou-se do m??todo de an??lise de que ?? voltado a entender como se relacionam os atores que constituem uma rede. Os atores que participaram da rede projetual objeto deste estudo s??o designers, especialistas de outras disciplinas e os futuros usu??rios de uma plataforma digital para compartilhar conhecimento na comunidade de Taquara/RS. Foram coletados dados sobre as rela????es sociais entre os participantes e sobre os fluxos de informa????es durante o desenvolvimento do projeto. Dessa forma, foi poss??vel desenhar os mapas de rela????es e calcular os ??ndices de centralidade dos atores, ou seja, foi poss??vel visualizar quem forneceu e quem recebeu informa????es, quais atores engajaram-se no processo servindo com intermedi??rios das informa????es, os agrupamentos organizacionais, entre outras informa????es. O resultado do cruzamentos dos dados indicou que: os designers inseriramse na rede tornando-se fonte das informa????es projetuais; o gestor do projeto desempenhou o papel de gestor das rela????es provocando o adensamento das rela????es projetuais; alguns designers e um especialista tornaram-se fontes das informa????es de aprendizado das ferramentas projetuais. Tais resultados podem servir de insumos estrat??gicos para o trabalho em redes projetuais, auxiliando os designers no entendimento de suas fun????es projetuais quando operando projetos colaborativos interorganizacionais, interfuncionais e interdisciplinares. The {{present study}} examined the evolution of design network during {{the development of a}} codesign project involving actors from different organizations (interorganizational) from various disciplines of knowledge (interdisciplinary) and with different positions and tasks (interfunctional). We used the method of social network analysis which is addressed to understand the actor???s relationship who constitute a network. The actors who participated of the project???s network, object of this study, are designers, specialists from other disciplines and future users of a digital platform for sharing knowledge in Taquara / RS community. It were collected data about the social relationships between the participants and about the flow of information during the development of the project. Thus, it was possible to draw maps of relationships and calculating the actor???s centrality, ie, it was possible to see who gave and who received information, which actors engaged in the process serving with <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> organizational clusters, among other information. The result of the data???s intersections indicated that: the designers were inserted in the network becoming source of project's information; the project manager acted as manager of the relationships causing thickening of project relations; some designers and one expert become information???s source for learning of the project tools. These results may provide strategic inputs to work in project networks, helping designers in understanding its functions when operating interorganizational, interfunctional and interdisciplinary collaborative projects...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores a class <b>of</b> firms: the <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> {{personal}} <b>information.</b> In {{the economics}} <b>of</b> personal <b>information,</b> scarcity {{is no longer}} the only, and foremost, determinant of value. The most important determinant of value becomes connection. Adapting what Gervais claims to be the first law of an information-flooded cloud-modelled economy, value is not derived from scarcity but rather from the fact that those who value it most will find it. Personal information is the raw material to create connections. Intermediaries collect personal information in exchange for goods or services, regardless of whether they actually need that information to perform their main activity, and use this information to connect other goods and services with the users who value them most, e. g. via personalisation or targeted advertising. Many firms in many different sectors are, or could become, <b>intermediaries</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>information,</b> from Google to supermarkets, from telecom operators to insurance companies. The descriptive analysis of this industry has consequences in terms of business model and regulatory approach. As for the former, it is worth exploring the conditions for which a firm could profitably become an <b>intermediary</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>information</b> and thereby exploit untapped resources for revenue generation. As for the latter, an imperfect understanding of the economics <b>of</b> personal <b>information</b> creates the risk for misaligned norms, and therefore for an uneven competition...|$|R

40|$|Lobbying {{for school}} reform, {{cleaning}} up graffiti, and enacting noise ordinances are daily problem-based activities performed by organized citizen groups. Routinely {{in the course}} of problem-solving, these organizations-both formal and informal-seek out, interpret, distill, and re-frame information. But understanding information access and use in a community where a range of community-based, organized groups play the role <b>of</b> <b>information</b> seeker as well as information provider and facilitator presents a challenge to the researcher. In these settings, information researchers must address the context of the community and the multiple roles that the community-based groups play in the local information environment. In this paper we argue that organized local groups are critical to the <b>information</b> landscape <b>of</b> communities precisely because they play important intermediation roles. Based on our field work conducted in Hartford, Connecticut, we identified several broad strategies employed by problem-centered information intermediaries. They make information relevant for their constituents by distilling, tailoring, and vetting. They use formal and informal mechanisms to collect and share information. Finally, they prepare information for specific uses and disseminate it broadly to the community.

40|$|The new {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) are rapidly evolving and continue to transform the modes and patterns of communication by enabling handling <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> facilitating forms <b>of</b> communication among human actors and electronic systems.

According to USAID (2003), understanding the place of ICTs in a developing country agriculture depends on four key concepts: i) that knowledge is an increasingly significant factor of production; ii) that all actors in the agricultural sector are part of an evolving Agricultural Knowledge System (AKS); iii) that ICTs accelerate agricultural development by facilitating knowledge management for AKS members; and iv...|$|R
40|$|Criteria for {{initiation}} of highly active antiretroviral treatments (haart) in hiv-infected patients remain {{a matter of}} debate world-wide because short-term benefits have to be balanced with costs of these therapies, and restrictions placed on future treatment options if resistant viral strains develop. The debate has intensified with the adoption of an international objective to guarantee access to treatment to a minimum of three million infected individuals by 2005 in developping countries. In order to take into account irreversibility and inertia effects associated with ex ante choices, we propose a simple stochastic dynamic model of sequential therapeutic choice with <b>intermediary</b> revelation <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> in which the efficiency gains from a new effective Therapy in second period are conditional on the results of the treatment in the previous period. We find that identical patients may be administered different treatments at the optimum; for parameters implying an all or nothing cut decision in period 2, a more forward looking decision rule is required in period 1 because there will be little space for adjustment to its consequences. Another finding is that as soon as risks of resistance due to therapeutic failure of initial treatments are significant, as perhaps in developing countries and in marginalized groups of developed countries, differences in the estimation of this risk should not influence the optimal decision {{about the size of the}} hiv-infected population eligible for early antiretroviral Therapy. The decision should then be based on pure efficiency/cost considerations. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{identification}} {{of a change in}} the acting in Institute <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> and Science and Technology (IBICT), given the broadening of interaction means with the users, this study aims towards understanding the socio-informational context in changes bearing in sight the theoretical framework <b>of</b> <b>information</b> actions in the ambit <b>of</b> “intermediary <b>information</b> institutions. ” The theoretical trajectory suggested that, in the social plan, {{it would be possible to}} comprehend the current dynamics around information actions, especially from the technological modifications provided with new hardware, software and, above all, the World Wide Web, which influences the manner and behavior of the processes of search, retrieval, access and use <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by the user. Highlighting the user in this new scenario, this concept was analyzed as a means or a tool to learn two theoretical-informational models. The “systemic model” is characterized in function of the emphasis directed towards the professional and information system. In this model, the flow <b>of</b> <b>information</b> presents a foreseeable chain direction counting on the pretense of knowledge of the target public and of how the system works. In this sense, the “emerging model” spots problems in the previous model as it considers interactive possibilities, interconnectivities and hypertexts provided by the WWW. Given this panorama, it was possible to outline the following assumption: the contemporary socio-informational context and the theoretical construction of the “emerging socio-technical informational model” have been influencing information actions in “information institutions and intermediary systems” in S&T. Under this perspective, the trajectory of the research went through three moments. In the opening moment, a theoretical framework was spotted based on the categories “conceptual focus attributed to the user and to the information” and “nature and focus of the researches”, which helped in the process of visualization of certain analytical aspects aligned with “systemic” or “emerging” models. The identified theoretical framework brought systematizations around the phenomena of search, use, behavior, practice and action <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> In the moment of outlining, the action <b>of</b> <b>information</b> approach was put in context, bringing nearer the concept of the meaning <b>of</b> validation <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> especially to point out research possibilities regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> In the last moment, called calculus, the results obtained were articulated so as to allow an interpretation guided by the concept <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in S&T. For such, the Brazilian scenario <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> in S&T was put in context oriented by the actions developed in IBICT. This institution was taken as a reference for being responsible for a representational fragment <b>of</b> actions <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in S&T in the country in the ambit <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> institutions and systems <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> IBICT operates meta-information aiming towards the access, retrieval and use <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> creating and providing the subsidies for the creation of meta-informational maps, targeting the monitoring and control <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in S&T, as well as performing actions considering criteria <b>of</b> excellence in <b>information</b> and S&T. From the theoretical path and the analysis of the actions from IBICT, the complexity and interdependency of different instances and actions in the ambit <b>of</b> institutions and <b>intermediary</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in S&T were identified and criticized, under the orientation from criteria of excellence particular from the phenomena related with information in S&T and, also, under the theoretical influence of the “emerging socio-technical informational model. ...|$|R

A chapter on community care represents an important part; it is closely related to the complex rehabilitation system in the treatment of mental disorders. On the last pages I focus on specific communication with people suffering from dementia, psychosis and neurosis. The first goal of the thesis was to find out the differences in therapeutic activities according to diagnoses within a range of psychotic disorders, neurotic disorders and organic disorders. There was a hypothesis linked to the given goal in which I thought that {{the therapeutic}} activities realized with the patients would differ according to their diagnoses. The second goal was to find out whether professional staff consider it important to use the possibility of extramural (community) care within the framework of caring for the mentally ill. For this purpose a hypothesis was set up in which I assumed that the professional staff of a psychiatric asylum had a negative view towards using extramural (community) care. The goals of the thesis were achieved. Information was obtained through a quantitative survey, by the method of questioning and the technique of data collection [...] through a questionnaire. The first monitored group consisted of 20 therapists and the second monitored group was made up of 84 nurses working at the Jihlava psychiatric asylum. The surveys results confirmed the first hypothesis. The second hypothesis was not confirmed. The findings of this thesis {{could be used as a}} source <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> particularly for work therapists and other therapists who, within the framework of psychosocial rehabilitation and therapeutic activities, use many activities such as supporting treatments for mental disorders. The thesis provides an overview of the activities applied in treating mental illnesses. Furthermore, therapists and nurses can use the findings about community care and subsequent services for patients with mental disorders.

This information is commonly decoded either by mass spectrometry or by measuring relative multiplet areas in a 13 C NMR spectrum. We demonstrate here that groups of glutamate 13 C isotopomers may be quantified by indirect detection of protons in a 2 D HMQC-TOCSY NMR spectrum and that fitting of these data to a metabolic model provides an identical measure of the 13 C fractional enrichment of acetyl-CoA and relative anaplerotic flux to that given by direct 13 C NMR analysis. The sensitivity gain provided by HMQC-TOCSY spectroscopy will allow an extension of 13 C isotopomer analysis to tissue samples not amenable to direct 13 C detection (∼ 10 mg soleus muscle) and to tissue metabolites other than glutamate that are typically present at lower concentrations...|$|R

It is found that in a more competitive environment (with higher return on short-term debt) the solvency requirement has to be strengthened, and in an environment where the fire sales penalty is higher and fund managers are more conservative the liquidity requirement has to be strengthened while the solvency one relaxed. Higher disclosure or introducing a derivatives market may backfire, aggravating fragility (in particular when the asset side <b>of</b> a financial <b>intermediary</b> is opaque) and, correspondingly, liquidity requirements should be tightened.
