500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911:I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ...

2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the United States became engaged in a series of local {{conflicts}} in Latin America, which went into history as banana wars. The main purpose of these wars were to defend American commercial interests in the region. Later, U.S. Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler famously wrote, [...] "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers.

[...] "From when I was 8 or 10 I {{knew it was going to}} be a career for me. [...] It's a tennis life so it wasn't so easy. [...] You have to give up many things.

60|$|Zulime {{was living}} with her sister, and there <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> evenings {{and some of my}} afternoons during the {{following}} week, scarcely able to realize my change of fortune except when alone with her, discussing our future. She agreed at last to a date for the wedding which would enable us to spend Thanksgiving at West Salem, and then for some reason, not clear to me now, I suddenly took the train for Gallup, New Mexico, with the Navajo Indian Agency for final destination.|$|E

6000|$|Bates' Hall was deliciously comfortable, {{and every}} day at nine o'clock I was at the door eager to enter. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> day at a desk in the big central reading room, but at night I haunted the Young Men's Union, thus adding myself to a dubious {{collection}} of half-demented, ill-clothed derelicts, who suffered the contempt of the attendants by reason of their filling all the chairs and monopolizing all the newspaper racks. We never conversed one with another {{and no one knew}} my name, but there came to be a certain diplomatic understanding amongst us somewhat as snakes, rabbits, hyenas, and turtles sometimes form [...] "happy families." ...|$|E
60|$|My lameness, which dated {{from that}} ride down the Navajo cañon, persisted, which was another worriment; for Zulime {{was too busy}} with sewing-women to give much time to me and walking was very painful, hence <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> day down at the bank, talking with my {{prospective}} father-in-law, who interested me {{much more than the}} sordid little village and its empty landscape. He was a sturdy, slow-moving man with long, gray beard, a powerful and strongly individual thinker, almost as alien to his surroundings as a Hindoo Yoghi would have been. With the bland air of a kindly teacher he met his customers in the outer office and genially discoursed to them of whatever happened to be in his own mind--what they were thinking about was of small account to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{case was}} to come up early in July, and <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time, to the {{detriment}} of other affairs, in preparing for it. I was greatly hampered in my work by my client, who filled my office with his tobacco-smoke and that of his friends, and he took it very much for granted {{that he was going to}} win the suit. Fortune had always played into his hands, he said, and I had no little difficulty in convincing him that matters had passed from his hands into mine. In this I believe I was never entirely successful. I soon found, too, that he had no ideas whatever on the value of discretion, and it was only by repeated threats of absolute failure that I prevented our secret tactics from becoming the property of his sporting fraternity and of the town.|$|E

"There were {{thousands}} of soldiers on both sides during the Civil War, who, at the beginning, started to keep a diary of daily events, but those who kept a record {{from start to finish}} can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

50|$|The script, when I {{met with}} John Cusack and the writers, was 132 pages. I said: “Look, I’m not doing {{anything}} over 100 pages.” They said, “Okay,” and they did a re-write, and it came back 150 pages. So I said “Okay, you guys are fired,” and <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> pre-production re-writing the screenplay, getting it down to 102 pages.

60|$|The good-natured negro {{dropped his}} work {{and led the way}} upstairs, I {{following}} expectant, to the attic. A rickety ladder rose to a kind of tower (cupola, I suppose it would be called), whence the bay spread out before me like a picture, the white islands edged with the whiter lacing of the waves. There, indeed, was the fleet, but far away, like toy ships on the water, and the bit of a fort perched on the sandy edge <b>of</b> an island. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> that day there, watching anxiously for some movement.

60|$|From my infancy I {{was noted}} for the docility and {{humanity}} of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous {{as to make}} me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with {{a great variety of}} pets. With these <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it, then. Well, I {{will tell}} you the facts briefly in as few words as I can. I was always much given to {{experimental}} philosophy, and <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time in the little laboratory which I had built for myself behind my father's house in the Strand. I had a small independent fortune of my own, left me by an uncle who had made successful ventures in the China trade; and as I was indisposed to follow my father's profession of solicitor, I gave myself up almost entirely to the pursuit of natural philosophy, following the researches of the great Mr. Cavendish, our chief English thinker in this kind, as well as of Monsieur Lavoisier, the ingenious French chemist, and of my friend Dr. Priestley, the Birmingham philosopher, whose new theory of phlogiston I have been much concerned to consider and to promulgate. But the especial subject to which I devoted myself was the elucidation of the nature of fixed air. I do not know how far you yourself may happen to have heard respecting these late discoveries in chemical science, but I dare venture to say that you are at least acquainted with the nature of the body to which I refer." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 1990 I had just began my doc- toral studies at the University of Connecticut.

There, in his early years, he developed a love for reading and discovered such diverse writers as Clark Ashton Smith, Michael Moorcock, and Jack Vance through books imported from the United Kingdom. He said of this time, [...] "When I ran out of stories, I made up my own to keep myself entertained.
