40|$|Abstract—Network {{management}} applications require {{large numbers}} of counters in order to collect traffic characteristics for each network flow. However, these counters often barely fit into on-chip SRAM memories. Past papers have proposed using counter estimators instead, thus trading off counter precision for a lower number of bits. But these estimators do not achieve optimal estimation error, and cannot always scale to arbitrary counter values. In this paper, we introduce the CEDAR algorithm for decoupling the counter estimators from their estimation values, which are quantized into estimation levels and shared among many estimators. These decoupled and shared estimation values enable us to easily adjust them without needing {{to go through all}} the counters. We demonstrate how our CEDAR scheme achieves the min-max relative error, <b>i.</b> e., <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> the best possible relative error over the entire counter scale. We also explain how to use dynamic adaptive estimation values in order to support counter up-scaling and adjust the estimation error depending on the current maximal counter. Finally we implement CEDAR on FPGA and explain how it can run at line rate. We further analyze its performance and size requirements. A. Background I...|$|R

40|$|In [1], [2] a {{simultaneous}} monostatic and bistatic GMTI technique {{has been proposed}} for improving target detection capabilities and situational awareness over the illuminated area. Specifically, {{it has been shown}} that: (<b>i)</b> detection <b>can</b> be <b>guaranteed</b> regardless of the target direction of motion, and (ii) the target velocity vector on ground can be estimated for targets detected in both datasets. In the latter case, a proper association of the monostatic and bistatic detections has to be performed. In [2], an association scheme is proposed based on the relocation of the targets on ground. While such a scheme is effective for sparsely populated target scenarios, it may fail if multiple closely spaced targets are present. In this paper the problem of correct association of simultaneous monostatic and bistatic target detections is addressed for a densely populated target scenario. In particular, different strategies to overcome this ambiguous detection association problem are proposed, by applying the simultaneous monostatic and bistatic GMTI in [1] to multiple subsequent CPIs.

40|$|Most of the {{industrial}} parts are designed as trimmed NURBS. Today 's graphics hardware supports the high-speed display of polygonal objects consisting of triangles. This means that analytical surfaces (like NURBS) need to be triangulated {{so they can be}} displayed by 3 D graphics cards. To be able to control the quality of the tesselated model, the triangulation should be carried out with a given error torelance. Currently available methods make it possible to achieve approximation of the surface in 3 D space with a given error and to polygonize the trimming curves with another given error, but only in the parameter space of the surface. From this fact follows that there exists no error control of the trimming curves in Euclidean space, which can result in cracks along the trimming curves in case of models consisting of more than one surface - and models usually consist of several hundreds or thousands of surfaces. Our new method introduced in this paper takes care of this problem, <b>i.</b> e. it <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> the geometric error along the trimming curves.
