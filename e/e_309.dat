30|$|Based on the {{structures}} of the ecMdfA-ACh and ecMdfA-reserpine complexes, we modelled a homology structure of VAChT overlaid with ACh and reserpine (Fig.  1). The homology VAChT model was cytoplasm-facing and consisted of 12 transmembrane helices, similar {{to the structure of}} ecMdfA. In addition, there were three carboxyl residues, D 46, <b>E</b> <b>309</b> and D 398, located in TM 1, 7 and 8, respectively, all within the central cavity. In the ACh-VAChT complexed model, ACh binds to <b>E</b> <b>309</b> through negative–positive charge interaction. Residue <b>E</b> <b>309</b> is located {{at the bottom of the}} large hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket, corresponding with the positioning of residue D 34 of ecMdfA. This confirmed that D 34 of MdfA is likely deprotonated during the process of substrate binding as previously proposed (Heng et al. 2015), as upon ligand binding, <b>E</b> <b>309</b> is likely to become similarly deprotonated. This buried acidic residue is necessary for the recognition of monovalent, positively charged substrates. In the VAChT-reserpine-complexed model, it appeared that residues D 398 and <b>E</b> <b>309</b> may form a hydrogen bond network with reserpine. This observation may explain the inhibition mechanism of reserpine, because this hydrogen bond network would stabilize VAChT in the cytoplasm-facing conformation, whereby inactivating it (Darchen et al. 1989). Furthermore, Khare et al. (2010) showed that both D 398 and <b>E</b> <b>309</b> directly bind with the allosteric inhibitor—vesamicol, but only the <b>E</b> <b>309</b> residue can bind ACh, while D 398 does not. These observations are consistent with our model.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} clad metal {{composition}} on {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC) behavior of three types of SMAW filler metals (E 308 L- 16, <b>E</b> <b>309</b> - 16 and E 316 L- 16), used for cladding components subjected to highly corrosive conditions, was investigated in boiling 43 % MgCl 2 solution. In order to evaluate the stress corrosion cracking susceptibility of the top layer, constant load tests and metallographic examinations in tested SCC specimens were conducted. The susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking was evaluated {{in terms of the}} time-to-fracture. Results showed that the <b>E</b> <b>309</b> - 16 clad metal presented the best SCC resistance. This may be attributed to the presence of a discontinuous delta-ferrite network in the austenitic matrix, which acted as a barrier to cracks propagation. Concerning to E 308 - 16 and E 316 L- 16 clad metals, results showed that these presented a similar SCC test performance.

30|$|As expected, the {{resolved}} ACh-complex structure {{shows that}} ACh indeed binds {{in the vicinity}} of the D 34 residue. The distance between the positively charged head group of ACh and the negatively charged side chain of D 34 is ~ 4.5  Å, while residues Y 30, L 263, F 358 and M 358 form hydrophobic interactions with ACh (Fig.  2). We overlaid the potential protonation sites of the VMATs or VAChT on the structure of ecMdfA based on sequence alignment (Fig. S 1). We found that three acidic residues of VAChT, D 33, <b>E</b> <b>309</b> and D 398, correspond with residues E 26, I 239 and N 331 of ecMdfA, respectively, which are located near the ACh-binding pocket. <b>E</b> <b>309</b> is located at the bottom of the substrate-binding cavity, and may play the same critical protonation-deprotonation role as D 34 in ecMdfA. Residue D 33, which corresponds with E 26 on ecMdfA, has been shown to take part in the recognition of positively charged substrates (Merickel et al. 1995).|$|E

40|$|Mutations to the {{canonical}} + 1 G of introns, which are {{commonly found in}} many human inherited disease alleles, invariably result in aberrant splicing. Here we report genetic findings in C. elegans that aberrant splicing due to + 1 G mutations can be suppressed by U 1 snRNA mutations. An intronic + 1 G-to-U mutation, e 936, in the C. elegans unc- 73 gene causes aberrant splicing and loss of gene function. We previously showed that mutation of the sup- 39 gene promotes splicing at the mutant splice donor in e 936 mutants. We demonstrate here that sup- 39 is a U 1 snRNA gene; suppressor mutations in sup- 39 are compensatory substitutions in the 5 ' end, which enhance recognition of the mutant splice donor. sup- 6 (st 19) is an allele-specific suppressor of unc- 13 (<b>e</b> <b>309),</b> which contains an intronic + 1 G-to-A transition. The <b>e</b> <b>309</b> mutation activates a cryptic splice site, and sup- 6 (st 19) restores splicing to the mutant splice donor. sup- 6 also encodes a U 1 snRNA and the mutant contains a compensatory substitution at its 5 ' end.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{different}} pathological L 1 CAM mutations have been identified that result in {{a broad spectrum of}} neurological and non-neurological phenotypes. While many of these mutations have been characterized for their effects on homophilic and heterophilic interactions, as well as expression levels in vitro, there are only few studies on their biological consequences in vivo. The single L 1 -type CAM gene in Drosophila, neuroglian (nrg), has distinct functions during axon guidance and synapse formation and the phenotypes of nrg mutants can be rescued by the expression of human L 1 CAM. We previously showed that the highly conserved intracellular FIGQY Ankyrin-binding motif is required for L 1 CAM-mediated synapse formation, but not for neurite outgrowth or axon guidance of the Drosophila giant fiber (GF) neuron. Here, we use the GF as a model neuron to characterize the pathogenic L 120 V, Y 1070 C, C 264 Y, H 210 Q, <b>E</b> <b>309</b> K and R 184 Q extracellular L 1 CAM missense mutations and a L 1 CAM protein with a disrupted ezrin–moesin–radixin (ERM) binding site to investigate the signaling requirements for neuronal development.

40|$|Phospholamban (PLB) {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} of SERCA 2 a, the Ca 2 +-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca 2 +. Recent cross-linking {{studies have suggested that}} PLB binding and Ca 2 + binding to SERCA 2 a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E 2 conformation of the Ca 2 +-ATPase, preventing formation of E 1, the conformation that binds two Ca 2 + (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca 2 + binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca 2 + pump. Seven SERCA 2 a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca 2 +-binding site I (E 770 Q, T 798 A, and E 907 Q), site II (<b>E</b> <b>309</b> Q and N 795 A), or both sites (D 799 N and <b>E</b> <b>309</b> Q/E 770 Q) were made, and the effects of Ca 2 + on N 30 C-PLB cross-linking to Lys 328 of SERCA 2 a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca 2 +-ATPase, none of the SERCA 2 a mutants (except E 907 Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca 2 +; however, all were phosphorylatable by Pi to form E 2 P. Ca 2 + inhibition of E 2 P formation was observed only in SERCA 2 a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N 30 C-PLB and each Ca 2 +-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca 2 +. Importantly, however, micromolar Ca 2 + inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca 2 +-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca 2 + pumps and N 30 C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca 2 +-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA 2 a...|$|E

40|$|The {{intracellular}} {{domain of}} the prolactin (PRL) receptor (PRLr) is required for PRL-induced signaling and proliferation. To identify and test the functional stoichiometry of those PRLr motifs required for transduction and growth, chimeras consisting of the extracellular domain of either the α or β subunit of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor (GM-CSFr) and the intracellular {{domain of the}} rat PRLr were synthesized. Because the high-affinity binding of GM-CSF results from the specific pairing of one α- and one β-GM-CSFr, use of GM-CSFr/PRLr chimera enabled targeted dimerization of the PRLr intracellular domain. To that end, the extracellular domains of the α- and β-GM-CSFr were conjugated {{to one of the}} following mutations: (i) PRLr C-terminal truncations, termed α 278, α 294, α 300, α 322, or β 322; (ii) PRLr tyrosine replacements, termed Y 309 F, Y 382 F, or Y 309 + 382 F; or, (iii) PRLr wild-type short, intermediate, or long isoforms. These chimeras were cotransfected into the cytokine-responsive Ba/F 3 line, and their expression was confirmed by ligand binding and Northern and Western blot analyses. Data from these studies revealed that heterodimeric complexes of the wild type with C-terminal truncation mutants of the PRLr intracellular domain were incapable of ligand-induced signaling or proliferation. Replacement of any single tyrosine residue (Y 309 F or Y 382 F) in the dimerized PRLr complex resulted in a moderate reduction of receptor-associated Jak 2 activation and proliferation. In contrast, trans replacement of these residues (i. <b>e.,</b> αY <b>309</b> F and βY 382 F) markedly reduced ligand-driven Jak 2 activation and proliferation, while cis replacement of both tyrosine residues in a single intracellular domain (i. <b>e.,</b> αY <b>309</b> + 382 F) produced an inactive signaling complex. Analysis of these GM-CSFr–PRLr complexes revealed equivalent levels of Jak 2 in association with the mutant receptor chains, suggesting that the tyrosine residues at 309 and 382 do not contribute to Jak association, but instead to its activation. Heterodimeric pairings of the intracellular domains from the known PRLr receptor isoforms (short-intermediate, short-long, and intermediate-long) also yielded inactive receptor complexes. These data demonstrate that the tyrosine residues at 309 and 382, as well as additional residues within the C terminus of the dimerized PRLr complex, contribute to PRL-driven signaling and proliferation. Furthermore, these findings indicate a functional requirement for the pairing of Y 309 and Y 382 in trans within the dimerized receptor complex...|$|R

Switching of one neuron between different rhythms can cause transition between behavioral modes. In {{order to understand the}} dynamics of rhythmically active neurons we analyzed the oscillatory membranpotential of a pacemaker neuron and used different neural network models to predict dynamics of its time series. In a first step we have trained conventional RBF networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using gaussian kernels with intracellulary recordings of the pyloric dilatator neuron in the Australian crayfish, Cherax destructor albidus. As a rule SVMs were able to learn the nonlinear dynamics of pyloric neurons faster (e. g. 15 s) than RBF networks (<b>e.</b> g. <b>309</b> s) under the same hardware conditions. After training SVMs performed a better iterated one-step-ahead prediction of time series in the pyloric dilatator neuron with regard to test error and error sum.

The best SVM used 196 support vectors and produced a test error of 0. 04622 as opposed to the best RBF with 0. 07295 using 26 RBF-neurons. In pacemaker neuron PD the timepoint at which the membranpotential will cross threshold for generation of its oscillatory peak is most important for determination of the test error.

Estimation of pKa values of the acidic residues in the transport sites indicates that at normal intracellular pH (7. 1 – 7. 2), PLB-bound SERCA populates an E 1 state that is deprotonated at residues <b>E</b> <b>309</b> and D 800 yet protonated at residue E 771. We performed three independent microsecond-long MD simulations to evaluate the structural dynamics of SERCA-PLB in a solution containing 100  mM K+ and 3  mM Mg 2 +. Principal component analysis showed that PLB-bound SERCA lies exclusively along the structural ensemble of the E 1 state. We found that the transport sites of PLB-bound SERCA are completely exposed to the cytosol and that K+ ions bind transiently (≤ 5  ns) and nonspecifically (nine different positions) to the two transport sites, with a total occupancy time of K+ in the transport sites of 80 %. We propose that PLB binding to SERCA populates a novel (to our knowledge) E 1 intermediate, E 1 ⋅H+ 771. This intermediate serves as a kinetic trap that controls headpiece dynamics and depresses the structural transitions necessary for Ca 2 +-dependent activation of SERCA. We conclude that PLB-mediated regulation of SERCA activity in the heart results from biochemical and structural transitions that occur primarily in the E 1 state of the pump...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe disease dengue (DEN) {{is caused}} by four genetically and serologically related viruses termed DENV- 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4. The DENV {{envelope}} (E) protein ectodomain {{can be divided into}} three structural domains designated ED 1, ED 2, and ED 3. The ED 3 contains the DENV type-specific and DENV complex-reactive (epitopes shared by DENV 1 – 4) antigenic sites. In this study the epitopes recognized by four DENV complex-reactive monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with neutralizing activity were mapped on the DENV- 3 ED 3 using a combination of physical and biological techniques. Amino acid residues L 306, K 308, G 381, I 387, and W 389 were critical for all four MAbs, with residues V 305, <b>E</b> <b>309,</b> V 310, K 325, D 382, A 384, K 386, and R 391 being critical for various subsets of the MAbs. A previous study by our group (Gromowski, G. D., Barrett, N. D., Barrett, A. D., 2008. Characterization of dengue complex-specific neutralizing epitopes on the envelope protein domain III of dengue 2 virus. J. Virol 82, 8828 – 8837) characterized the same panel of MAbs with DENV- 2. The location of the DENV complex-reactive antigenic site on the DENV- 2 and DENV- 3 ED 3 s is similar; however, the critical residues for binding are not identical. Overall, this indicates that the DENV complex-reactive antigenic site on ED 3 may be similar in location, but the surprising result is that DENV 2 and 3 exhibit unique sets of residues defining the energetics of interaction to the same panel of MAbs. These results imply that the amino acid sequences of DENV define a unique interaction network among these residues {{in spite of the fact}} that all flavivirus ED 3 s to date assume the same structural fold...|$|E
40|$|A erosão por cavitação deteriora componentes em serviço, tais como partes metálicas de bombas de água, válvulas e, em especial, pás de turbinas hidráulicas, sendo nesse último caso responsável por elevados prejuízos ligados tanto aos custos da manutenção direta, como sobretudo às perdas por interrupção na geração de energia elétrica. Dentre os materiais aplicados no reparo por soldagem de danos por cavitação incluem-se aços inoxidáveis tradicionais tipo AISI 308 <b>e</b> <b>309,</b> aços inoxidáveis ao Co e ligas à base de Co (stellites), caracterizando-se essas últimas pela maior sensibilidade a trincas, dificuldade de esmerilhamento e pelo mais alto custo. Nesse contexto este trabalho buscou formular, depositar e analisar o desempenho de aços inoxidáveis austeníticos CrMnSiN, soldados pelo processo PTA. A resistência à erosão por cavitação foi avaliada segundo a norma ASTM G 32 - 92. A microestrutura foi caracterizada por microscopia ótica e microscopia eletrônica de varredura e a formação de martensitas &# 945;' e &# 949;, induzida pela cavitação, foi avaliada por difração de raios-X. A integridade da superfície dos depósitos foi controlada por END, além disso a dureza e a facilidade de acabamaneto por esmerilhamento serviram como critérios para avaliar os revestimentos soldados. Verificou-se que os revestimentos aplicados por PTA eram livres de trincas de solidificação, com baixa porosidade, boa molhabilidade e adequado acabamento superficial. A melhor liga inoxidável austenítica elaborada (0, 03 %C; 0, 35 % N; 13, 2 %Cr; 11, 8 % Mn; 2, 8 %Si; bal %Fe) mostrou uma resistência à erosão por cavitação próxima aquela das principais ligas comerciais. Cavitation erosion deteriorates {{components}} like metallic {{parts of}} water pumps, valves and blades of hydraulic turbines, {{in this last}} case being responsible for high economical losses, associated to direct maintenance costs, but above all due to the interruption of the electric power generation. Among the materials usually applied in the welding repair of cavitation erosion are included the common stainless steels AISI 308 and 309, special Co-alloyed stainless steels and Co-base alloys (stellites), whereby these have as handicap a higher susceptibility to cracking, the difficult in finishing by grinding and the higher cost. In this context this work had the purpose to design, develop and evaluate CrMnSiN austenitic stainless steels, as deposited by the PTA process. The cavitation erosion resistance was evaluated using the vibratory ultrasonic test according ASTM G 32 - 92. The microstructure was analyzed by means of optical and scanning electronical microscopy {{and the nature of}} phases present in the coatings - the cavitation induced formation of martensites &# 945;' and &# 949; - was estimated by x-rays diffraction. Besides that the surface quality as examined by NDT, the hardness and the feasibility of finishing by grinding, where all evaluation criteria of the welded deposits. It was verified that the coatings applied by PTA were free from solidification cracks, had low porosity, good wetability and adequate surface finishment. The best austenitic stainless steel developed (0, 03 %C; 0, 35 % N; 13, 2 %Cr; 11, 8 % Mn; 2, 8 %Si; bal %Fe) showed a cavitation erosion resistance quite near the most resistant commercial alloys...|$|E
40|$|The period total first {{abortion}} rate (TFAR) {{has been used}} to estimate the proportion of women who will experience an induced abortion in their reproductive lifetime. It is a hypothetical measure as age-specific rates currently existing will change with time. Instead, a cohort TFAR has been calculated for women born around 1955 using legal-abortion reports in South Australia to calculate first {{abortion rate}}s for each year of age from 15 years to 44 years for 1971 – 2000, respectively, and summing these. Yearly fertility rates were also calculated for this cohort to further describe their reproductive experience. Yearly first abortion rates were also calculated for later cohorts born in 1960 – 1980. The 1955 cohort TFAR was 288. 1 per 1, 000 women aged 15 – 44 years. Cumulative first abortion rates at specific ages were higher for subsequent cohorts (<b>e.</b> g., <b>309.</b> 6 per 1, 000 at age 40 years for the 1960 cohort). Thus, about 29 % of South Australian women born around 1955 and exposed to legal abortion throughout their reproductive lifetime experienced an induced abortion.

40|$|Objectives: Stimulation of {{arginine}} vasopressin 2 receptor (V 2 R) with {{arginine vasopressin}} (AVP) {{results in a}} rise in von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII plasma levels. We hypothesized that gain-of-function variations in the V 2 R gene (AVPR 2) would lead to higher plasma levels of VWF and FVIII. Methods and Results: We genotyped the control populations of two population-based studies for four AVPR 2 variations: a- 245 c, G 12 <b>E,</b> L <b>309</b> L, and S 331 S. Rare alleles of a- 245 c, G 12 E, and S 331 S, which were in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with higher VWF propeptide, VWF and FVIII levels. The functionality of the G 12 E variant was studied in stably transfected MDCKII cells, expressing constructs of either 12 G-V 2 R or 12 E-V 2 R. Both V 2 R variants were fully glycosylated and expressed on the basolateral membrane. The binding affinity of V 2 R for AVP was increased three-fold in 12 E-V 2 R–green fluorescent protein (GFP) cells, which is in accordance with increased levels of VWF propeptide associated with the 12 E variant. The dissociation constant (KD) was 4. 5 nm [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 6 – 5. 4] for 12 E-V 2 R–GFP and 16. 5 nm (95 % CI 10. 1 – 22. 9) for 12 G-V 2 R–GFP. AVP-induced cAMP generation was enhanced in 12 E-V 2 R–GFP cells. Conclusions: The 12 E-V 2 R variant has increased binding affinity for AVP, resulting in increased signal transduction, and is associated with increased levels of VWF propeptide, VWF, and FVII...|$|R
40|$|Newborn {{screening}} (NBS) for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) {{revealed a}} higher birth prevalence and genotypic variability than previously estimated, including numerous novel missense mutations in the ACADM gene. On average, these mutations {{are associated with}} milder biochemical phenotypes raising the question about their pathogenic relevance. In this study, we analyzed the impact of 10 ACADM mutations identified in NBS (A 27 V, Y 42 H, Y 133 H, R 181 C, R 223 G, D 241 G, K 304 <b>E,</b> R <b>309</b> K, I 331 T and R 388 S) on conformation, stability and enzyme kinetics of the corresponding proteins. Partial to total rescue of aggregation by co-overexpression of GroESL indicated protein misfolding. This was confirmed by accelerated thermal unfolding in all variants, as well as decreased proteolytic stability and accelerated thermal inactivation in most variants. Catalytic function varied from high residual activity to markedly decreased activity or substrate affinity. Mutations mapping to the β-domain of the protein predisposed to severe destabilization. In silico structural analyses of the affected amino acid residues revealed involvement in functionally relevant networks. Taken together, our results substantiate the hypothesis of protein misfolding with loss-of-function being the common molecular basis in MCADD. Moreover, considerable structural alterations in all analyzed variants {{do not support the}} view that novel mutations found in NBS bear a lower risk of metabolic decompensation than that associated with mutations detected in clinically ascertained patients. Finally, the detailed insight into how ACADM missense mutations induce loss of MCAD function may provide guidance for risk assessment and counseling of patients, and in future may assist delineation of novel pharmacological strategies...|$|R
