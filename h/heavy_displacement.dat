50|$|Design {{characteristics}} of boats yield different performance characteristics in various seas and winds. PHRF {{does not address}} these differences. The result {{is that it is}} not difficult to predict which boats have a better chance of winning based on conditions during a race. This is especially true where design characteristics are extremely different. An example would be a light displacement, planing hull versus a <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement</b> non-planing hull. PHRF suggests that race organizers assign boats with similar design in their fleet divisions. This reduces the planing boat vs <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement</b> variable. Typically fleets are split by handicap number 'brackets' which exposes the wind condition/design problem.|$|E

50|$|For a given {{sail area}} a gaff rig has a shorter mast than a {{bermudian}} rig. In short-ended craft with full body, <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement</b> and moderate ballast ratio, {{it is difficult}} to set enough sail area in the bermudian rig without a mast of excessive height and a center of effort (CE) too high for the limited stability of the hull. Because of its low aspect ratio, the gaff rig is less prone to stalling if oversheeted than something taller and narrower.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} design, Niitaka was very {{conservative}} in layout and similar to, but somewhat {{larger than the}} earlier Japanese-designed [...] The increased <b>displacement,</b> <b>heavier</b> armor and lower center of gravity resulted in a more seaworthy and powerful vessel than Suma, and enabled Niitaka to outclass many other contemporary protected cruisers.|$|R
25|$|With such {{a limited}} time frame to use its budget, the Japanese Navy could not afford the time to design a new ship. Therefore, the {{blueprints}} for the previous Momo-class destroyers were distributed to each shipyard, with the instructions that identical ships be produced, except with sturdier armor and bow construction. Experience with extended overseas deployment in World War I had taught the Japanese Navy that the construction of its destroyers needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. The result was a ship which looked physically almost exactly like the Momo class, but was roughly 15 tons <b>heavier</b> in <b>displacement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The armour was {{thicker than}} that of many other cruisers of the time (such as the Italian Condottieri), heavy enough to {{withstand}} opposing cruiser main batteries. The belt and deck armour was substantially thicker than usual. Condottieri s Group III had only 60 mm belt and 30 mm deck, while La Galissonnière had a 75-105 mm armoured belt, and 37-50 mm deck armor thickness. This was enough to withstand a 152 mm round at combat range (navweaps.com gives 76 mm at 11,000 m, when fired from a British gun), while Italian counterparts cannot {{have done the same}} with their light armour, sacrificed for the best speed. Only the last group of Condottieri was superior, with a <b>heavier</b> <b>displacement</b> of 9,100 tons (20% more than French cruisers), 10 guns, and up to 130 mm armour (thought to withstand 152 mm as well), but they were only two ships. In any event, these powerful ships never fought one another. The La Galissonière-class cruisers 105 mm armored belt was also thicker than the Nürnbergs (50 mm), the HMS Didos (76.2 mm), or the Fijis (3.5-inch or 88 mm), and equivalent to the Leanders. The turret protection, with 100 mm (4-in.) on faces, and 50 mm (2-in.) on sides, back, and roofs was also better than on other cruisers with similar displacement (1.25-inch on German cruisers, 1-in, on the British ones, 2-in on Town or Fiji classes, and 3 to 5-in on [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The first KSS-III ship will {{be ready}} for service by 2025. The {{previous}} plan was to have an operational unit ready by 2017. Due to the relatively <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement</b> of the ship (3000~3500 tons) {{and the fact that it}} will be built with local Korean technologies (sensitive technologies might be blocked from export) the production of the submarine was delayed.

50|$|HDMLs had a round bilge <b>heavy</b> <b>{{displacement}}</b> hull 72 ft {{long with}} {{a beam of}} 16 ft and a loaded draught of 5 ft. Loaded displacement was 54 tons. The hull had a pronounced flare forward to throw the bow wave clear and provided considerable lift to prevent all but the heaviest seas from coming aboard. Although seaworthy, the boat had a considerable tendency to roll, especially when taking seas at anything other than directly ahead or astern. The cause was the round bilge midship section and a considerable reserve of stability, the effect of which was to impart a powerful righting moment if the boat was pushed over in a seaway. This, coupled with the round bilged hull and lack of bilge keels, would set up a rapid and violent rolling.|$|E

5000|$|The Brixham trawler was a <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement</b> boat of some 60-80 ft length on the deck, {{with a long}} {{straight}} keel, {{a straight}} vertical stem, usually a fantail stern, and a low freeboard to ease {{the handling of the}} nets, though this feature was disguised by high bulwarks. [...] Brixham trawlers carried a tall gaff rig, often ketch rigged though also simply a large sloop, that was powerful enough to carry them quickly to and from the fishing grounds and to tow large trawls. [...] Renowned yacht aerodynamicist and sailor C. A.

50|$|Initially {{designs were}} <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement,</b> with a fine, often V shaped stern {{as well as}} a fine bow. These were {{powerful}} boats for sailing to windward, but had limited performance offwind as well as often having an alarming tendency to broach - designers included Sparkman & Stephens and Dick Carter. Then Ron Holland's quarter-tonner Eygthene began the next phase of increasingly lightweight boats with fuller sterns giving more of a wedge shape, and a change from masthead rig to a fractional rig. This dinghy influence gave much faster performance reaching and downwind, and although windward performance was not as good it improved as the designs developed. The ultimate in this stage was the various lightweight centerboard designs with internal ballast, but these were not sufficiently seaworthy for offshore racing and so were penalised so heavily that they were effectively banned. Designs then moved to a more moderate displacement, and as race courses moved from offshore racing with plenty of reaching towards windward/leeward round the cans racing designs became narrower and less powerful but more easily driven.|$|E
5000|$|Strong, {{long lasting}} and, perhaps surprisingly, not {{necessarily}} heavy. First {{developed in the}} mid 19th Century in France. Used for building warships. Extensively refined in New Zealand shipyards in the 1960s and the material became popular among amateur builders of cruising sailboats in the 1970s and 1980s, because the material cost was cheap, although the labour time element was high. The weight of a finished ferro-cement boat is higher than wooden boats only {{in the case of}} small vessels. They are suitable for traditional hull forms of types such as the gaff cutter [...] As such they are often built as cruisers allowing more comfortable sea passages. Hulls built properly of ferro-cement are more labor-intensive than steel or fiberglass, so there are few examples of commercial shipyards using this material. The inability to mass-produce boats in ferro-cement has led there to there being few examples around. Many ferro-cement boats built in back yards can have a rough, lumpy look, which has helped to give the material a poor reputation. The ferro-cement method is easy to do, but it is also easy to do wrong. This has led to some disastrous 'home-built' boats. Properly designed, built and plastered ferro-cement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines. Amateur builders are advised to use a professional plaster to produce a smooth finish. Most ferro-cement hulls are designed as <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement.</b> See also concrete ship, concrete canoe.|$|E

30|$|For {{the second}} mechanism, the {{components}} in heavy oil or compositions from rock mineral react with water under high-temperature condition (Xu et al. 2013). The heavy components in heavy oil {{can be reduced}} to lighter ones after hydrothermal pyrolysis reactions between oil components and water, and the permeability of rock matrix can be increased due to high-temperature steam flooding (Xu et al. 2013). One may find that the above-mentioned two mechanisms can be achieved under static conditions. Note that the physical heating and chemical reactions are the basics of all mechanisms. This is because the decrease in oil viscosity and increase in rock permeability must be the fundamental objectives to achieve if the <b>heavy</b> oil <b>displacement</b> efficiency is wanted to be increased.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently {{application}} of nano/bio materials for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has been examined by few researchers, but there exists ambiguous concepts about simultaneous injection of nanoparticles/biomaterials.

In order to better illustrate the influence of nano/bio material different flooding scenarios containing distilled water, nanosilica/distilled water, biosurfactant/distilled water and nanosilica/biosurfactant/distilled water have been conducted. Experimental results indicate that simultaneous presence of nanoparticles and bioproducts have synergy on each other and because of IFT reduction, improving the mobility ratio and increasing the injected fluid viscosity; the oil recovery can be achieved about 58 %.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to produce a {{preliminary}} design of a medium speed slender hull motor boat with a length between 50 – 70 feet. The boat will be fuel efficient and capable of long passage making at a medium speed. The motorboat {{will have to be}} designed to recreational craft directive standards (RCD). The choice of a slender body hull form was chosen to provide a suitable platform to produce an efficiently powered motorboat that is more economical than the current trend of motorboats. The current trend is to produce high volume motorboats with large interiors and reasonably <b>heavy</b> <b>displacement,</b> these requirements do not lend itself to an efficient hull form. Instead huge engines are required to push the boat to a top speed required by the owner, even though when cruising, the boat will not often operate at the top speed because of the cost and limited range. The slender hull motorboat will not be capable of reaching the speeds capable by a planing motorboat but will have a sprint speed capability. The cruising speed of the slender hull is above that of a standard displacement cruising boat which for the size range is below 10 kts. The idea is that the slender hull form motorboat can cruise economically at a speed of 0. 45 - 0. 5 Froude No (Fn) with a range making it possible to larger distances. The sprint speed is there for short journeys where fuel efficiency is not so important and increases the possibility of travelling to further locations in a short time, {{which is one of the}} advantages of a planing motorboat. The motorboat will be designed to be comfy, a stable for offshore cruising, it will have berths to accommodate up to 6 people with separate showers and head for each cabin. With a slender body hull form the volume per length is less this makes the accommodation a factor in the decision of the overall length of the vessel. The project looks at layout options to optimise the interior space and flow, making it user friendly and supplying adequate room. With a slender hull, stability is one of the major issues that have been looked into, RCD have criteria that needs to be met, the project looks at the effect of varying the waterline beam and the vertical centre of gravity and where the limits in the hull form are with minimum beam and VCG being found. With part of the brief being an efficient hull form, resistance and propulsion were another important aspect of the project. Analysis of varying hull forms was undertaken using Wolfson Powering Program to find the key factors affecting the resistance of the vessel. The Final Vessel came to a length of 20. 2 m overall and beam of 4. 75 m, it has a cruise speed of 13 knots and a range of 1017 nm. It meets the criteria for the both range and speed and also supplies accommodation for 6 people. The vessel also passed RCD stability requirements for Category A...|$|E

The goal was to minimize resistance by designing a vessel that is longer, but narrower than its competitors, which not only improves resistance characteristics but also enhances the seaworthiness. It is designed for both sea and inland waterways for maximum flexibility. A comparison of structural weights showed the benefits of GRP over aluminium.

30|$|For {{the first}} mechanism, the heavy oil will be heated {{to a higher}} {{temperature}} under thermal fluid injection, and the corresponding oil viscosity will be reduced. As a result, the mobility of heavy oil is increased. This oil displacement mechanism is caused by heat conduction. It has been {{pointed out that the}} contribution of heat conduction on oil recovery efficiency increases rapidly with the increase of steam quality, and the effect of steam temperature on physical heat conduction can be neglected when it is superheated steam (Sun et al. 2018 b). This study revealed that physical heating is not the dominant factor in controlling oil recovery efficiency when it is superheated steam. However, {{it has been reported that}} the oil recovery efficiency is greatly increased when saturated steam is replaced with superheated steam (Xu et al. 2013). This finding showed that either chemical reactions or the hydrodynamic mechanism is the dominant controlling factor in increasing <b>heavy</b> oil <b>displacement</b> efficiency.|$|R
