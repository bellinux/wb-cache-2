5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald <b>Ditch,</b> an irrigation <b>ditch</b> near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the <b>ditch</b> has failed numerous times, sending several tons of dirt and mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the <b>ditch</b> in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the <b>ditch</b> with pipes.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the <b>ditch</b> since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the <b>ditch</b> in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} <b>ditch</b> is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the <b>ditch</b> was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy weathering, the <b>ditch</b> {{is still}} visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep.

In 1997, {{a segment of the}} <b>ditch</b> 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the <b>ditch</b> remains unprotected.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{drainage}} channels and <b>ditches</b> are ubiquitous {{features in the}} lowland agricultural landscapes, built primarily to facilitate land drainage, irrigate agricultural crops and alleviate flood risk. Most drainage <b>ditches</b> are considered artificial waterbodies and are not typically included in routine monitoring programmes, {{and as a result}} the faunal and floral communities they support are poorly quantified. This paper characterizes the aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of agricultural drainage <b>ditches</b> managed by an internal drainage board in Lincolnshire, UK. The drainage <b>ditches</b> support very diverse macroinvertebrate communities at both the site (alpha diversity) and landscape scale (gamma diversity) with the main arterial drainage <b>ditches</b> supporting greater numbers of taxa when compared to smaller <b>ditches.</b> Examination of the between site community heterogeneity (beta diversity) indicated that differences among <b>ditches</b> were high spatially and temporally. The results illustrate that both main arterial and side <b>ditches</b> make a unique contribution to aquatic biodiversity of the agricultural landscape. Given the need to maintain drainage <b>ditches</b> to support agriculture and flood defence measures, we advocate the application of principles from ‘reconciliation ecology’ to inform the future management and conservation of drainage <b>ditches...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport <b>Ditch.</b> The complex of defences also included Southport <b>Ditch</b> which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the <b>ditch</b> is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the <b>ditch</b> is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the <b>ditch</b> was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport <b>Ditch,</b> and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of the <b>ditch.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century several duck decoys were {{built on the}} moor. These {{consisted}} of {{a pool of water}} leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches.

The combination of <b>ditch</b> and net-covered hoops is known as a pipe.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists {{occupied}} the low-lying moor, behind a drainage <b>ditch</b> that Rupert noted {{as an effective}} obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute {{over the course of}} the <b>ditch</b> at the time of the battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de Gomme, shows the <b>ditch</b> in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that the <b>ditch</b> was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right.|$|E

He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep <b>ditch</b> and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the <b>ditch.</b> Then the <b>ditch</b> was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the <b>ditch.</b> These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

50|$|No {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in the <b>ditches</b> or in the area enclosed by the <b>ditches,</b> but maize pollen was found under soil that had been disturbed from digging the <b>ditches.</b> Radio-carbon dating indicates that all three circles were complete by 450 BCE. There is no evidence of the circles' being used for habitation, ceremonial or defense purposes. Sears holds that the maize pollen indicates that the circles were used for cultivation. The <b>ditches</b> around the circles penetrated the hardpan, helping to drain the prairie soil. Sears also states that the Great Circle likely was used for gardens from several centuries BCE until the end of period II, around 600 to 800. Sears compares the circular <b>ditches</b> at Fort Center to similar circular <b>ditches</b> used for agriculture in pre-Columbian Colombia.|$|R

40|$|Helicopter <b>ditching</b> {{scenarios}} over {{salt water}} present an intense and immediate array of stressors for aviators and aircrew members. These initial stressors are further exacerbated by survival stressors, which ensue following safe egress from the <b>ditched</b> air vehicle. The {{scope of this}} paper encompasses a study of both planned and un-planned survivable <b>ditching</b> scenarios with respect to military rotary-wing applications. In order to gain a more complete understanding of the stresses involved following <b>ditching</b> over salt water, three phases will be discussed: initial <b>ditching,</b> underwater egress and water survival. An accumulation of stressors from the initial <b>ditching</b> phase, to the underwater egress situation, to salt-water survival can quickly lead to distress, or may enhance one’s will to survive, depending on the mindset relied upon. Bolstering the will {{to survive in a}} salt-water environment following a helicopter <b>ditching</b> requires comfort in the water and confidence of self, gained via a structured training regime. Training allows for practical experience and educates aviators/aircrew on the psychological affects one may anticipate in a given water survival scenario...|$|R
