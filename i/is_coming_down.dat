25|$|Use of {{diclofenac}} {{in animals}} {{has been reported}} to have led to a sharp decline in the vulture population in the Indian subcontinent – a 95% decline by 2003 and a 99.9% decline by 2008. The mechanism is presumed to be renal failure, however toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures. Vultures eat the carcasses of livestock that have been administered veterinary diclofenac, and are poisoned by the accumulated chemical, as vultures do not have a particular enzyme to break down diclofenac. At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March 2005, the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of diclofenac. Meloxicam is a safer candidate to replace use of diclofenac. It is more expensive than diclofenac, but the price <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> as more drug companies begin to manufacture it.|$|E

His mind soon changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl from the village who <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she [...] "accidentally" [...] drops her water pot. Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village. After Mowgli chooses to stay in the Man-Village, Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.|$|E
500|$|Northcott {{joined the}} Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) {{as a major}} general on 1 September 1941 and was given the AIF serial number VX63396. He was {{attached}} to the British 7th Armoured Division in the Middle East to study armoured warfare, returning to Australia in December 1941 to organise the new 1st Armoured Division. The job was a challenging one that some of his subordinates felt that Northcott was not up to, given his lack of command experience. In March 1942, Northcott found out from The Herald newspaper that he was to be promoted to command II Corps. [...] "This is what they do to me", was his comment, [...] "just as my first tank <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the road". The new post came with a promotion to the temporary rank of lieutenant general on 6 April 1942, which became substantive on 12 December 1945. Northcott was succeeded as commander by Major General Horace Robertson, an officer with a distinguished combat record in the desert.|$|E
