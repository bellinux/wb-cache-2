6000|$|The liberals, {{according}} to that ably written newspaper, have now [...] imbibed as a permanent sentiment a “distaste for national [...] greatness.” This distaste is now grown into matter of principle. [...] “The disgust at these principles of action ever grew in depth and [...] extent,” {{so that in the}} Danish, the American, and the [...] Franco-German wars, there was “an increasing portion of the nation [...] ready to engage in the struggle on almost any side,” as a protest [...] against the position that it was bound not to engage in it at all! [...] The climax of the whole matter was reached when the result of the [...] Alabama treaty displayed to the world an England overreached, [...] overruled, and apologetic. It certainly requires the astounding [...] suppositions, and the gross ignorance of facts, which the [...] journalist with much truth recites, to explain the manner in which [...] for some time past pure rhodomontade has not only done the work of [...] reasoning, but has been accepted as a cover for constant [...] miscarriage and defeat; and doctrines of national self-interest [...] and self-assertion as supreme laws have been set up, which, if [...] unhappily they harden into “permanent sentiment” and “matter of [...] principle,” will destroy all the rising hopes of a true public law [...] for Christendom, and will substitute for it what is no better than [...] the Communism of Paris enlarged and exalted into a guide of [...] international relations. It is perhaps unreasonable to expect that [...] minds in the condition of the “increasing portion” should on any [...] terms accept an appeal to history. But, for the sake of others, [...] not yet so completely emancipated from the yoke of facts, I simply [...] ask at what date it was that the liberal administrations of this [...] country adopted the “permanent sentiment” and the “matter of [...] principle” which have been their ruin? Not in 1859-60, when they [...] energetically supported the redemption and union of Italy. Not in [...] 1861, when, on the occurrence of the Trent affair, they at a few [...] days’ notice despatched ten thousand men to Halifax. Not when, in [...] concert with Europe, they compelled the sultan to cut off the head [...] of his tyrannical pasha, and to establish a government in the [...] Lebanon not dependent for its vital breath on Constantinople. Not [...] when in 1863 they invited France to join in an ultimatum to the [...] German Powers, and to defend Denmark with us against the intrigues [...] which Germany was carrying on under the plea of the Duke of [...] Augustenburg’s title to the Duchies; and when they were told by [...] Louis Napoleon in reply that that might be a great British [...] interest, but that it had no significance for France. Not when in [...] 1870 they formed in a few days their <b>double</b> <b>treaty</b> for the defence [...] of Belgium. Does, then, the whole indictment rest on this—that, in [...] conformity with the solemn declaration of the European Powers at [...] Paris in 1856, they cured a deep-seated quarrel with America by [...] submitting to the risk of a very unjust award at Geneva; and [...] reconciled a sister nation, and effected a real forward step in [...] the march, of civilisation at about half the cost which the [...] present administration has recently incurred (but without paying [...] it) in agitating and disturbing Europe? Or is it that during all [...] those years, and many more years before them, while liberty and [...] public law were supported, and British honour vindicated, [...] territorial cupidity was not inflamed by the deeds or words of [...] statesmen, British interests were not set up as “the first and [...] great commandment,” and it was thought better to consolidate a [...] still undeveloped empire, which might well satisfy every ambition, [...] as it assuredly taxes to the utmost every faculty.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} whether taxation has {{an influence}} on the location decisions of multinational enterprises. As a tax measure, we employ the Tax Attractiveness Index (see Keller and Schanz 2013). This index covers 18 different tax factors, such as the taxation of dividends and capital gains, withholding taxes, the existence of a group taxation regime, and thin capitalization rules. Our count data regression analysis is based on a novel hand-collected data set consisting of the subsidiaries of German DAX 30 companies. Controlling for non-tax effects, we find that a country's tax environment as measured by the Tax Attractiveness Index has a significantly positive effect on the number of Germancontrolled subsidiaries located there. Hence, our study implies that location decisions depend on a bundle of tax factors as captured by the index. In a second step, we show that the location decisions of German DAX 30 companies cannot be explained by the statutory tax rate alone. In contrast, withholding taxes, <b>double</b> <b>treaty</b> networks, and special holding regimes seem to play a decisive role in location decisions. Previous studies examining only the influence of statutory tax rates may thus have underestimated the effects of taxation on the activities of multinational companies...|$|E

50|$|From the 1950s onward, {{there was}} {{significant}} {{growth in the}} use of tax havens by corporate groups to mitigate their global tax burden. The strategy generally relied upon there being a <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaty</b> between a large jurisdiction with a high tax burden (that the company would otherwise be subject to), and a smaller jurisdiction with a low tax burden. By structuring the group ownership through the smaller jurisdiction, corporations could take advantage of the <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaty,</b> paying taxes at the much lower rate. Although some of these <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> survive,, for example between Barbados and Japan, between Cyprus and Russia and Mauritius with India, which India sought to renegotiate in 2007, most major countries began repealing their <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaties</b> with micro-states in the 1970s, to prevent corporate tax leakage in this manner.|$|R

The study {{deals with}} the methods for {{elimination}} of double taxation that are applied in <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties.</b> The first aim {{of the study is}} to systematise and analyse the methods for elimination of double taxation under <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of how they work. A number of issues relating to the application of these methods are analysed. Since <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> are applied by tax authorities, courts, and taxpayers in a domestic law context, i. e. within the framework of the legal system of a particular state, the analysis focuses on the application in Sweden of the methods for elimination of double taxation under <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties.</b> The second aim of the study is to evaluate in a few selected situations the two main methods for elimination of double taxation recommended by the OECD, namely exemption with progression and ordinary credit, on the basis of whether tax neutrality is achieved. For the purpose of this study, tax neutrality is deemed to be achieved when the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction corresponds to the tax that would have been levied in either the state of residence (i. e. capital export neutrality, “CEN”) or in the other contracting state (i. e. capital import neutrality, “CIN”), had the cross border element not been present. Furthermore, for the purpose of this study, tax neutrality is deemed to be achieved if the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction is within the range set by CEN and CIN. The evaluation shows that ordinary credit stands a greater chance than exemption with progression of achieving an outcome which is consistent with the goal of tax neutrality in the situations selected for study...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} taxes paid by {{multinational}} enterprises (MNEs) in host and home countries {{continues to make}} headline news. Corporate tax regimes, particularly those in many OECD countries, have never been more complex and the competition {{to attract and retain}} foreign direct investment (FDI) has perhaps never been so great. All of these political, legal, economic and competitive realities face countries {{at a time when they}} need additional budget revenues. At the June 2012 G- 20 Summit in Los Cabos, leaders identified base erosion and profit shifting as key fiscal issue to be addressed. Many are expecting this to translate into a new approach to applying existing international tax standards, an increased pressure to eliminate "corporate tax breaks", enact tougher anti-abuse provisions, and less tolerance of aggressive tax planning. There has been an increased critical focus on transfer pricing, corporate restructuring and <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties.</b> Some have suggested that <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> are eroding the domestic tax bases of developing countries, while others conclude that <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> promote development and FDI and thereby expand the tax base. Dividing up a "revenue pie" has never been easy and the implementation of international tax rules to transparently and predictably allocate revenue to avoid double taxation and double non taxation has never been more adversarial between taxpayers and tax authorities and between tax jurisdictions. It was for these reasons that the Global Tax Policy Center of the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law (Vienna University of Economics and Business) and the International Tax and Investment Center (ITIC) decided to undertake this study. The objective of our study was to look at the development impact of <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaties</b> and, more broadly, how tax policy can help generate economic growth and prosperity. Legally domestic tax laws are normally subordinate to international <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaties,</b> but in reality a <b>double</b> tax <b>treaty</b> only serves a country as well as its domestic tax regime. We've concluded that the problems affecting developing countries lie not with <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> but rather in weak domestic tax legislation. Our study reviews empirical data from 20 developing countries, including LDCs, middle-to-high income developing countries, resource-rich countries, and BRIICS[1] countries. We hope that the empirical analysis and the conclusions that can be drawn from it can help guide policymakers to refocus their policy objectives to boost capital formation, expanding exports, and protect their domestic tax bases. We believe that a country with strong domestic tax legislation can advance their pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals by affectively utilizing <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> and the related international tax rules to more transparently share and grow their tax base.

50|$|The {{criteria}} for residence in <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaties</b> {{may be different}} from those of domestic law. Residency in domestic law allows a country to create a tax claim based on the residence over a person, whereas in a <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaty</b> it has the effect of restricting such tax claim in order to avoid double taxation. Residency or citizenship taxation systems are typically linked with worldwide taxation, as opposed to territorial taxation. Therefore, it is particularly relevant when two countries simultaneously claim a person to be resident within their jurisdiction.|$|R

40|$|<b>Double</b> {{taxation}} <b>treaties</b> are enacted {{to abolish}} incidents of double taxation. Moreover, it helps {{less developed countries}} in attracting foreign direct investment, discourage, and eradicate double taxation. Several studies have revealed {{that there is a}} positive impact of implementing DTTs on attracting foreign direct investment to developing countries. Implementing a <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaty</b> is not something that happens overnight. In fact less developed countries spent years efforts and other very scarce resources to discuss, implement and finalize these treaties with developed nations. In addition, less developed nations also forgo potential tax revenues. Most often these treaties favour residence-based over source-based taxation. The forgone tax incomes and the money invested in negations with developed nations in addition to other implementation cost can only make sense if the expected benefits in terms of FDI out-weight such costs. This paper critically reviews the literature on the impact of implementing <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaties</b> on attracting FDI inflows to developing nations. This review is further augmented with a synopsis of economic models used by policy makers to analyse potential tax impact on FDI decisions...|$|R

40|$|To {{what degree}} {{developing}} countries gain from signing <b>double</b> tax <b>treaties</b> is being hotly debated. In this paper, we analyze the Austrian tax treaty policy. Combining legal and economic perspectives, {{we find that}} developing countries are likely to expect {{both positive and negative}} impacts from signing a <b>double</b> tax <b>treaty</b> (DTT) with Austria. On the one hand, the results of our econometric analysis suggest that middle-income countries that sign a DTT with Austria may expect an increased number of foreign direct investment projects from Austrian companies. On the other hand, the signatory states may suffer from limited withholding taxation rights established in the DTTs for the source country, which could lead to reduced tax revenues in the developing countries.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} multinational firms and <b>double</b> taxation <b>treaties</b> for corporate income taxation in open economies. We show that it is optimal for a small open economy to levy positive corporate income taxes if multinational firms are taxed according to the full taxation after deduction system or the foreign tax credit system. Positive corporate taxes also occur in the asymmetric case where some countries apply the exemption system and others apply the tax credit system. If all countries apply the exemption system, the optimal corporate income tax is zero. We also show that, under tax competition, corporate income taxes are not necessarily too low {{from the perspective of}} the economy as a whole. While the undertaxation result is confirmed for the case of the exemption system, tax rates may also be inefficiently high if the deduction or the credit systems are applied.
