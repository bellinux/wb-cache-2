This research is aimed to determine the {{correlation between}} (1) grammatical competency and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation, (2) attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation, (3) grammatical competency and attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation. The research was conducted at Physic Education, Ahmad Dahlan University, from July to October 2010. The research used descriptive of correlation. The research population was the second semester at Physic Education. The sample consisted of 40 university students who were taken by using purposive random sampling.

The instruments validity test used product moment and r point biserial. The instruments reliability test used KR- 20 and alpha cronbach. The technique analysis for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation. The result of the study showes that: (1) {{there is a positive}} correlation between grammatical competency and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (1 y r = 0, 84 at the level of significance α = 0, 05 with N= 40 where tt = 1, 68); (2) there is a positive correlation between attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (2 y r = 0, 42 at the level of significance α = 0, 05 with N= 40 where tt = 1, 68); (3) there is a positive correlation between grammatical competency and attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (Ry. 1. 2 = 0, 87 at the level of significance α = 0, 05 with N= 40 where ft = 3, 25).
