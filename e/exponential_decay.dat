5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, usually by covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, {{which may be}} called suicide substrates, follow <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> functions and are usually saturable.

5|$|Each {{radioactive}} isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that {{is determined by}} the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life.

5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following <b>exponential</b> <b>decay.</b> Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E

5|$|A {{cooperative}} Half-Life {{game was}} first alluded to by publisher Sierra On-Line in November 2000 with {{the announcement of}} a PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life. At the time, however, it was unclear how a cooperative version of Half-Life would be implemented; the developers, Gearbox Software, were still experimenting with finding the most balanced number of players to build a cooperative game around. By E3 2001, the game had acquired the title Decay, named after the scientific concept of <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> for consistency with the scientific names used by previous Half-Life titles. While the E3 convention only provided {{a demonstration of the}} main Half-Life PlayStation 2 game, further details were released relating to Decays premise and story, as well as confirming that the cooperative mode was to be designed for two players. The game's use of new model sets were also showcased. These new models were updated versions of Gearbox's High Definition pack for , featuring higher numbers of polygons and animation features such as facial expressions. The enhanced models were around twice as detailed as those in the High Definition pack, which itself was of a much higher quality than the original models in Half-Life. Media updates through the months following E3 showed various screenshots and the trailer to the game. On August 18, 2001, Sierra announced that Decay was nearly complete, and would be submitted to PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony for verification within days. The entire Half-Life for PlayStation 2 package achieved gold status on October 30, 2001, and the game was released on November 14, 2001.|$|E

25|$|Dispersing {{boundary}} {{plays the}} same role for billiards as negative curvature does for geodesic flows causing the exponential instability of the dynamics. It is precisely this dispersing mechanism that gives dispersing billiards their strongest chaotic properties, as it was established by Yakov G. Sinai.

25|$|The {{decay of}} many {{physical}} quantities is not exponential—for example, the evaporation {{of water from}} a puddle, or (often) the chemical reaction of a molecule. In such cases, the half-life is defined {{the same way as}} before: as the time elapsed before half of the original quantity has decayed. However, unlike in an <b>exponential</b> <b>decay,</b> the half-life depends on the initial quantity, and the prospective half-life will change over time as the quantity decays.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{radioactive}} materials {{were known to}} have characteristic <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> rates, or half-lives.

25|$|For this system, when Q> (i.e., {{when the}} system is underdamped), it has two complex {{conjugate}} poles that each have a real part of −α. That is, the attenuation parameter α represents the rate of <b>exponential</b> <b>decay</b> of the oscillations (that is, of the output after an impulse) into the system. A higher quality factor implies a lower attenuation rate, and so high-Q systems oscillate for many cycles. For example, high-quality bells have an approximately pure sinusoidal tone {{for a long time}} after being struck by a hammer.|$|E
25|$|A {{system with}} low quality factor (Q<nbsp&) {{is said to}} be overdamped. Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by <b>exponential</b> <b>decay,</b> approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an asymptote.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{consider}} an <b>exponential</b> <b>decaying</b> form for dark energy as EoS parameter {{in order to discuss}} the dynamics of the universe. Firstly, assuming that universe is filled with an ideal fluid which consists of <b>exponential</b> <b>decaying</b> dark energy we obtain time dependent behavior of several physical quantities such as energy density, pressure and others for dark energy, dark energy-matter coupling and non-coupling cases. Secondly, using scalar field instead of an ideal fluid we obtain these physical quantities in terms of scalar potential and kinetic term for the same cases in scalar-tensor formalism. Finally we show that ideal fluid and scalar-tensor description of dark energy give mathematically equivalent results for this EoS parameter.
