5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> feminist economists was to {{critique}} the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single {{centralised}} Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin {{to take responsibility for}} strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{described}} subspecies, a 1989 morphometrical {{study by}} Humphrey and Setzer separated only two—O. p. natator from much of Florida (including O. p. coloratus, O. p. planirostris, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. floridanus, {{as well as}} O. p. argentatus) and O. p. palustris {{from the rest of}} the range (including O. p. texensis). However, Whitaker and Hamilton in their 1998 book on the Mammals of the Eastern United States recognized O. p. planirostris and O. p. sanibeli as separate subspecies, but merged all others into O. p. palustris, and placed O.argentatus as a separate species; their classification was based on their <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> overwater gaps as agents of biological diversification and a critique of shortcomings in Humphrey and Setzer's study, not on a reanalysis of the data.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{continued}} to receive armaments from Ticonderoga, with guns arriving on September 21 {{and also on}} October 5. However, the artillery were positioned {{too far away to}} do much damage to the fort. With the arrival of the new guns, Montgomery planned to move the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> the bombardment from {{the east side of the}} fort to the north side, where they would be closer. However, his officers unanimously rejected this plan, fearing that many men would desert due to the increased danger. Montgomery ordered that a new battery be built where the Royal Savage could be threatened. On October 14, the battery was completed and then used to sink the British ship.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E

5|$|Although a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, {{the naval}} {{campaign}} in the Adriatic may have had far reaching consequences for the wider conflict. In particular, the events of 1811 were studied closely by Napoleon; in a chance meeting with Murray Maxwell in 1817, the former Emperor recalled Maxwell's action on 29 November 1811 intimately and commended Maxwell on his victory. The agreement between France and Russia to support each other in operations against the Ottoman Empire {{could not have been}} fulfilled without secure supply lines from France to the Balkans and those supply lines could not be assured without naval control of the Adriatic. British historian James Henderson has linked the action of November 1811 to this strategic problem, suggesting that the loss of the convoy and its 200 cannon may have been a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> his planned campaign of 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Bell {{assembled}} the Stanley Professionals in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any {{games because of}} negative publicity received by Chicago due the Black Sox Scandal. He joined John Heisman's staff at Penn {{as an assistant coach}} in 1920, and Bell would remain there for several years. At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities. At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing and frequenting Saratoga Race Course, where he counted as friends Tim Mara, Art Rooney, and George Preston Marshall. In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> in-season scrimmages during practices by Lud Wray, a fellow assistant coach.

5|$|Japan's bomb-damaged {{cities were}} rebuilt after the war. War damage {{and the need}} to rehouse {{soldiers}} and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions. In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities. The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government. The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however. In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout, though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations. Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not until well after the war that major urban improvement projects were undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the {{familiar}} Paris salons, Offenbach quietly shifted the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> his work from being a cellist who also composed to being a composer who played the cello. He had already published many compositions, {{and some of them}} had sold well, but now he began to write, perform and produce musical burlesques as part of his salon presentations. He amused the comtesse de Vaux's 200 guests with a parody of Félicien David's currently fashionable Le désert, and in April 1846 gave a concert at which seven operatic items of his own composition were premiered before an audience that included leading music critics. After some encouragement and some temporary setbacks, he seemed on the verge of breaking into theatrical composition when Paris was convulsed by the 1848 revolution, which swept Louis Philippe from the throne and led to serious bloodshed in the streets of the capital. Offenbach hastily took Hérminie and their recently born daughter to join his family in Cologne. He thought it politic to revert temporarily to the name Jacob.|$|E
5|$|Choe Bu of the Tamjin Choe clan {{was born}} in 1454 in the prefectural town of Naju in Jeollanam-do, Korea. Choe passed the jinsa {{examinations}} in 1477, which was a lower examination that did not immediately ensure a post in government; rather, it permitted enrollment in the National Academy, or Seonggyungwan, where he could study further for the higher mungwa examinations. In preparation for the exams, he studied the Five Classics as Confucian students had for centuries, but he also was taught the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> the Four Books of Zhu Xi (1130–1200), which was {{in line with the}} Neo-Confucian doctrine first accepted in mainstream Chinese education during the mid-13th century. He passed his first civil service examination in 1482 and a second civil service examination in 1486, qualifying him for an immediate post in government. In a career as a graduate scholar-official that spanned 18 years, Choe was privileged with various positions. He held posts in the Hodang Library, printing office, and the National Academy. He also held posts involving the military, such as on the military supplies commission, with the office of the inspector-general, and with the Yongyang garrison. The culmination of his career was his promotion as a minister of the Directorate of Ceremonies in the capital, a distinguished office. Choe Bu {{was also one of the}} scholars who aided in the compilation of the Dongguk Tonggam in 1485, a history of Korea from ancient times. Choe was learned in Confucian ethics, Chinese letters, Chinese poetry, and well versed in Korean history, geography, and famous people; all this later helped him to dispel the notion of Chinese that he was a Japanese pirate instead of a Korean official who had unfortunately shipwrecked in China. In 1487, Choe Bu was sent to Jeju Island to check the registers for escaped slaves from the mainland.|$|E
