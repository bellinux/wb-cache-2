Reaching for a larger value of the city (both in aesthetic and safety) after dark, and the dark periods of time making more significant part of the rhythm of life of the population, there must be conducted researches on city streets lighting. On this basis can and should be organised a separates specific city's or several cities lighting plans, studies in which would be solved aesthetic and technical questions.
