500|$|Stuart Jones of The Times {{concluded}} in his match report that The Football Association (FA) were given no choice, [...] "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute." [...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years is too often. The name of Arsenal has been sullied {{and that is why}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> this action." ...|$|E

500|$|Agnew was {{involved}} in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on Test Match Special in 2009. The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview", but Will Buckley, writing for The Observer, described Agnew's [...] "amorous ambitions" [...] as [...] "positioned... firmly on the pervy side of things". Agnew was furious, noting he [...] "gave... Will Buckley 24hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined... As you can imagine, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> being called a pervert quite badly." [...] Allen herself supported Agnew: [...] " [...] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to... he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one." [...] Buckley eventually apologised.|$|E
500|$|Keats {{was never}} a {{professional}} writer. Instead, he supported himself with a small income that he earned as a surgeon for Guy's Hospital. At the age of 23, Keats left the hospital, losing his source of income, in order to devote himself to writing poetry. He lived with Charles Brown, a friend who collected Keats's poetry while supporting him, during spring 1819 and composed poetry. The early products of this effort included La Belle Dame sans Merci and [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{the first of a}} series of odes that he would write that year. It is uncertain as to when the poem was actually completed, but Keats sent the poem to his brother on 3 May 1819 with an attached letter saying, [...] "The following poem, the last I have written, is the first and only one with which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> even moderate pains; I have, for the most part, dashed off my lines in a hurry; this one I have done leisurely; I think it reads the more richly for it, and it will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|Verity never {{spun the}} ball very far, {{particularly}} after his second tour to Australia, and preferred {{to concentrate on}} bowling a good length. However, critics {{did not think that}} Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: [...] "Do not praise me when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket." [...] At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.|$|E

500|$|Historians today {{generally}} {{dismiss the}} authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury's history of the English kings stated [...] "Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return" [...] and his work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church"—larded as it is with known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur's grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur's body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: [...] "Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [...] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Sinatra {{came out}} of his {{short-lived}} retirement with a television special and album. The album, entitled Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back, arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, was a success, reaching number 13 on Billboard and number 12 in the UK. The television special, Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra, reunited Sinatra with Gene Kelly. He initially developed problems with his vocal cords during the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing. That Christmas he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and returned to Caesars Palace the following month in January 1974, despite previously vowing to perform there again [...] He began what Barbara Sinatra describes as a [...] "massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East and Australia". In July, while on a second tour of Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists there– who were aggressively pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conference– as [...] "bums, parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers". After he was pressured to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for [...] "fifteen years of abuse <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> from the world press". In the end, Sinatra's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged a final concert which was televised to the nation, and Sinatra was given the opportunity to say [...] "I love your attitude, I love your booze" [...] to the Australian people. In October 1974 he appeared at New York City's Madison Square Garden in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title The Main Event– Live. Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month.|$|E

2500|$|The abrupt {{change in}} Prince Henry's {{somewhat}} carefree life {{up to that}} point was made clear by the new King on the very first evening of his reign. [...] "If you two think that, now that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> this new job on, you can go on behaving just as you like, in the same old way, you are very much mistaken! You two have to pull yourselves together", the King warned his two brothers at dinner.|$|E
