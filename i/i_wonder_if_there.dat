500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's not a good sign that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> might have been a better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dickens's {{serialisation}} of {{his novels}} was not uncriticised by other authors. In Robert Louis Stevenson's novel The Wrecker, {{there is a}} comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: [...] "See! They were writing up the log," [...] said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. [...] "Caught napping, as usual. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that Helena and William's mother Sarah {{had developed a}} reputation of exaggerated claims about the Sidis family. Helena had also falsely claimed that the Civil Service exam William took in 1933 was an IQ test and that his ranking was an IQ score of 254. It is speculated that the number [...] "254" [...] was actually William's placement on the list after he passed the Civil Service exam, as he stated in a letter sent to his family. Helena also claimed that [...] "Billy knew all the languages in the world, while my father only knew twenty-seven. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were any Billy didn’t know." [...] This claim was not backed by any other source outside the Sidis family, and Sarah Sidis also made an improbable claim in her 1950 book The Sidis Story that William could learn a language in just one day. Boris Sidis had once dismissed tests of intelligence as [...] "silly, pedantic, absurd, and grossly misleading".|$|E

5000|$|While {{attending}} the 2014 Sochi Olympics, Kripps {{learned that his}} own website had been restricted from access in Russia.

50|$|For {{quite some}} time, I have {{been fascinated by}} the Hero’s Journey or the monomyth. Most stories that follow this pattern have a decidedly male orientation: a lone {{individual}} acts heroically and saves the day. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> might be an alternate form, a feminine Hero’s Journey. So I began to look at stories that featured female protagonists {{to see if they}} offered something different. What I found surprised me. Most of these women were either killed off or were ultimately rescued from their plight by male heros. Unsatisfied, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could write a Hero’s Journey for women where the strong but wounded heroine {{must find a way to}} save herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you know}} the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound, and so on. It {{is said to be}} heard at night upon the moor. <b>I</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were any {{evidence}} of such a sound to-night." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bates {{believed}} the science fiction {{stories of the}} time were poorly written: [...] "Amazing Stories! Once I had bought a copy. What awful stuff I'd found it! Cluttered with trivia! Packed with puerilities. Written by unimaginables! But now at the memory <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> might be a market for a well-written magazine on the Amazing themes." [...] Bates wrote that the [...] "science fiction of the early writers had little relation to science of the scientists." [...] What science fiction writers did was to [...] "extrapolate" [...] and not [...] "relate" [...] because [...] "almost all {{of what is called}} science fiction is fantasy and nothing else but." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like a chap who parts like a sportsman," [...] he declared. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is {{anything}} I {{can do for}} you.

6000|$|... "So you see," [...] the Colonel resumed, [...] "he was {{probably}} {{in touch with a}} loose lot, though what benefit his death could have been to any one it is, of course, a little hard to imagine.

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is what they call dying, sister. It is a much lovelier way to end than as we do in the dust bin or rag-bag. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a little Heaven {{anywhere}} for good dolls?" [...] answered Flora, with what looked like a tear on her cheek; but it was only a drop from the violets sent by the kind Doctor last night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{perfectly}} natural causes, as Dr. Brown would say," [...] replied Treherne. [...] "Didn't the Squire tell us {{the trees}} had a shrill note of their own when the wind blew?

I stopped at a Chatham Street lodgin'-house one night, when I was feelin' kind of rich, an' thought the bed there was great; but it wasn't a marker 'longside of this one. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were {{feathers}} in it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{is such a}} {{thing in}} nature as a FAT MIND?

6000|$|... "Oh yes!--all of them. Even Gaspard is kind now.

6000|$|...

6000|$|... 'Glad {{you think}} so. The fact is it's {{going to take}} a heap of taming to make me go well in harness anywhere.
