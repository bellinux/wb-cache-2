25|$|There are {{two types}} of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when a person’s artery, which {{supplies}} blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a thrombus, or the blood clot can travel from somewhere else in the blood system that is called an embolus. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious.</b> The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure hypertension, and an aneurysm.|$|E

500|$|Several scandals {{took place}} during the Kirchner administration. The first {{involved}} the detention of Venezuelan-American businessman Antonini Wilson in an airport after being found with a suitcase filled with $800,000. This money was illegally provided by Petróleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, to be used for Kirchner's 2007 general election campaign. Details of the case were explained by businessman Carlos Kauffmann and lawyer Moisés Maiónica, who pleaded guilty. The FPV financing of the 2007 elections caused another scandal years later. Three pharmaceutical businessmen, Sebastián Forza, Damián Ferrón, and Leopoldo Bina, were found dead in 2008, a case known as the [...] "Triple Crime". Further investigation of Forza, who contributed $200,000 to the campaign, identified him as a provider of ephedrine to the Sinaloa Cartel. In 2015, Martín Lanatta and José Luis Salerno, convicted for the killings, claimed that Aníbal Fernández was the boss of a mafia ring that ordered those killings to secure the illegal traffic of ephedrine. Fernández denied the charges, maintaining that it was a set up to undermine his chances in the 2015 general election. General illegal drug trade grew in Argentina during Kirchnerism, and saw Mexican and Colombian syndicates working with Peruvian and Bolivian smugglers. Conviction rates for money laundering were almost nonexistent. Mariano Federici, head of the Financial Information Unit, said that the [...] "magnitude of the threat <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious,</b> and this would never have been possible without collaboration from government officials in this country".|$|E

I believe that [...] is not as the people at home imagine it, with a hurrah and a roar; it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious,</b> very grim." [...] An English translation by J.

Therefore we should also press new ROK regime to return Takeshima to Japan." [...] Further he said [...] "While we should press strongly for return of Takeshima to Japan, if by any chance new regime were unwilling to do so we should, as very minimum, insist that they agree to submit matter to International Court of Justice for arbitration." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some Israeli Jews and Palestinians {{who oppose}} a one-state {{solution}} have nevertheless {{come to believe}} that it may come to pass. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert argued, in a 2007 interview with the Israeli daily Ha'aretz, that without a two-state agreement Israel would face [...] "a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights" [...] in which case [...] "Israel [...] finished". This echoes comments made in 2004 by Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, who said that if Israel failed to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians, that the Palestinians would pursue a single, bi-national state. In November 2009, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat proposed the adoption of the one-state solution if Israel did not halt settlement construction: [...] " [...] refocus their attention on the one-state solution where Muslims, Christians and Jews can live as equals. ...

2500|$|Ryo <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> about {{fighting}} and loyal {{to his friends}} and family. He has been given discipline through his Karate training by his father, Takuma. He earned the nickname, [...] due to his remarkable use of his fighting style. He uses the Kyokugen-ryu style to fight, but unlike Robert he is more focused in punching attacks. While fighting in some games {{under the name of}} Mr. Karate or Mr. Karate II, Ryo does not use many of the flashier moves he is known for. Instead, he fights using moves similar to the ones of his father, Takuma Sakazaki. He treats Robert as his rival, but they are best friends. In several games, the Kyokugen style is depicted as a struggling family business, funded almost entirely by prize money earned from KOF and Robert's vast wealth. As such, Ryo and Robert sometimes start fighting since Ryo thinks that Robert is insulting him when he shows something expensive. Compared to Yuri and Robert's ideology on training, Ryo believes he can attain greatness in his art through hard work and experience. It has been implied several that there is some romantic tension between him and King during The King of Fighters series. Upon discovering that, Takuma seeks to intensify that relationship so that he can have a new heir for the Kyokugen-ryu.|$|E
2500|$|Upon hearing {{news of the}} speech, Paul Cravath, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, asked McKenzie for a report. On June 8, 1925, McKenzie {{forwarded}} Cravath a six-page letter {{addressing the}} matter. McKenzie recognized the ramifications of Du Bois's address. [...] "The whole situation is one that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> indeed", and reported after the speech, [...] "the audience was tumultuous in its applause and so carried away {{that it seemed to}} almost trample over Mrs. McKenzie and me after the address." [...] McKenzie acknowledged that [...] "the dominant view of the colored people today is more or less sympathetic with Dr. Du Bois on the race issue," [...] and conceded that today [...] "nothing is so popular with colored audiences as denunciation of the whites, and nothing so unpopular as its absence." [...] But McKenzie refuted Du Bois' accusations that were [...] "not more than partially true." [...] He learned that at the first of the two concerts [...] "the manager of the Auditorium helped in the sale of tickets and not very tactfully turned the colored people to one window, her object being to get two streams of people in accordance with their destination. This matter was brought to my attention that night by one of our alumni and the situation was changed the next morning." [...] He further noted that [...] "we recently widened the amount of space allowed the colored people, so much so that at the last concert, in May, hundreds of white people overflowed into the colored section, mingling indiscriminately with the colored people." [...] Shortly after Du Bois's speech, Fisk trustees drafted a formal letter vigorously supporting the policies McKenzie pursued at Fisk." [...] However, Fisk trustee William DeBerry, the Black leader of St. John's Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of the largest Black Congregational churches in the United States, refused to sign the letter. DeBerry told Wood, [...] "I must confess that I share to some extent with many others of the Fisk alumni in a grave anxiety and fear as to the ultimate outcome of what they consider an ultra conciliatory attitude on the part of Dr. McKenzie toward southern sentiment as regards the Negro problem." [...] "I do not agree with Dr. Du Bois in all he is reported to have said in his recent address at Fisk, nor do I approve of the maneuver in which attack on Dr. McKenzie was made." ...|$|E
