25|$|Like George Stephenson, Ericsson {{understood}} {{that a large}} area was needed to extract heat from the hot gases.

Within the horizontal section was a tube carrying the hot gases, this formed an ‘S’ shape so the gases made three passes through the water. This ‘S’ shaped tube was also tapered causing the gases to speed up as they cooled down. In practice this tube is almost impossible to clean.|$|E

25|$|Also on September 10, DNI Mike McConnell {{testified before}} the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that the Protect America Act had helped foil a major terror plot in Germany. U.S. intelligence-community {{officials}} questioned the accuracy of McConnell's testimony and urged his office to correct it, which he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> statement issued September 12, 2007. Critics cited the incident {{as an example of}} the Bush administration's exaggerated claims and contradictory statements about surveillance activities. Counterterrorism officials familiar with the background of McConnell's testimony said they did not believe he made inaccurate statements intentionally as part of any strategy by the administration to persuade Congress to make the new eavesdropping law permanent. Those officials said they believed McConnell gave the wrong answer because he was overwhelmed with information and merely mixed up his facts.|$|E
25|$|As Swiss champions, Basel {{entered the}} Champions League third {{qualifying}} round against German club Werder Bremen. Basel {{won the first}} leg 2–1 at St. Jakob-Park but lost 3–0 at the Weserstadion in the second leg, the aggregate score finishing 4–2 in Bremen's favour. Basel were then dropped into the UEFA Cup, where they met Široki Brijeg of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first round. Basel sealed a 6–0 aggregate win and were drawn into Group E alongside Strasbourg, Roma, Red Star Belgrade and Tromsø. FCB lost the first group match 2–0 against Strasbourg at home but won 2–1 away to Red Star, giving themselves an opportunity to progress to the next round if they won their next game against Tromsø. They <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seven-goal thriller, winning 4–3 and securing third place. The last match of the group was against Italian club Roma at the Stadio Olimpico, where the Serie A club won 3–1. In the Round of 32, FCB came up against Monaco, which they beat 2–1 on aggregate after a 1–1 stalemate in Monaco and a 1–0 victory for Basel in Switzerland. As Basel progressed to the last 16, they played against Strasbourg once again. FCB won the first leg 2–0 and drew 2–2 in the second leg, winning 4–2 overall. In the quarter-finals, the club came up against Middlesbrough. FCB won 2–0 at home and looked certain to progress as they travelled to the Riverside Stadium. This was not the case, however, as Middlesbrough fought back to win the match 4–1 and the tie 4–3.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing {{what needed}} to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{observed}} that Trott continually stood in one place, showing {{little interest in}} events around him.

[...] Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket, which he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "mechanical, indifferent fashion". In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him. [...] A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: [...] "Here is a well-known cricketer, whom we once treated as a hero. [...] But alas!

500|$|Henry's {{next steps}} {{are not well}} documented; one chronicler, Orderic Vitalis, {{suggests}} that he travelled in the French Vexin, along the Normandy border, {{for over a year}} with a small band of followers. By the end of the year, Robert and William Rufus had fallen out once again, and the Treaty of Rouen had been abandoned. In 1092, Henry and his followers seized the Normandy town of Domfront. Domfront had previously been controlled by Robert of Bellême, but the inhabitants disliked his rule and invited Henry to take over the town, which he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bloodless coup. Over the next two years, Henry re-established his network of supporters across western Normandy, forming what Judith Green terms a [...] "court in waiting". By 1094, he was allocating lands and castles to his followers {{as if he were the}} Duke of Normandy. William Rufus began to support Henry with money, encouraging his campaign against Robert, and Henry used some of this to construct a substantial castle at Domfront.|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} for Strange Days was {{originally intended to}} start on May 12, 1994, but was delayed to June 6, 1994 because the full cast list was incomplete. Bigelow said that the O. J.

The film was entirely shot in the Greater Los Angeles Area {{over a period of}} 77 nights. Producer Steven-Charles Jaffe said that the city was generally very cooperative, except for the subway scene as the team only had four hours a night to film it. Jaffe, however, remarked that Bigelow [...] "was so well prepared that what would have taken another director several weeks to do, she <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matter of days." [...] The production team also received permission from the West Hollywood film commission to film on Sunset Boulevard for a two-day period, which required the shut down of several lanes of traffic.|$|E
500|$|Game {{developer}} Ready at Dawn {{pitched the}} idea of a God of War game for the PlayStation Portable to Santa Monica Studio soon after the original God of War launched. Cory Barlog officially confirmed the development of Chains of Olympus at a God of War II launch event, stating [...] "It is its own story that connects to the overall story." [...] Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, in-house engine referred to as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006). Originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor, Ready at Dawn convinced Sony to increase the clock speed of the PSP to 333MHz, which they <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> firmware upgrade. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence, but noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, game director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E

500|$|Heartbreakers, Mirkin's second film as {{a feature}} director, was {{released}} in 2001. Mirkin rejected the project three times because he disliked the script.

[...] Eventually, Mirkin was allowed to rewrite the script himself, which he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year's time. He filmed the project in Florida and Los Angeles and had a cameo appearance in the film as Jack's lawyer. Reactions to both the film and Mirkin's direction of it were more varied compared to Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Roger Ebert said the film was not [...] "as sly and has no ambition to be [...] charming" [...] as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, [...] "but in a season of dreary failed comedies it does what a comedy must: It makes us laugh". Chris Hewitt of Empire wrote that [...] "Mirkin's direction is a little flat, but he's clearly having tremendous fun," [...] but Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today opined that Mirkin [...] "never gets the timing right and allows the story to drag with little internal logic".|$|E
500|$|Hutton had {{to compute}} the {{individual}} attractions due {{to each of the}} many prisms that formed his grid, a process which was as laborious as the survey itself. The task occupied his time for a further two years before he could present his results, which he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hundred-page paper to the Royal Society in 1778. He found that the attraction of the plumb-bob to the Earth would be 9,933 times that of the sum of its attractions to the mountain at the north and south stations, if the density of the Earth and Schiehallion had been the same. Since the actual deflection of 11.6″ implied a ratio of 17,804:1 after accounting for the effect of latitude on gravity, he was able to state that the Earth had a mean density of , or about [...] that of the mountain. The lengthy process of surveying the mountain had not therefore greatly affected the outcome of Maskelyne's calculations.

500|$|The Giants {{made the}} {{decision}} to hire a General Manager {{for the first time in}} team history following the 1978 season. [...] However, disagreements during the search caused severe friction and discord between owners Wellington and Tim Mara. At one point they had tried to hire Jan Van Duser, a league executive, but he declined the offer due to the ownership squabbles. Finally, the Maras asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to step in with a recommendation. Rozelle recommended George Young,Pervin. pg. 73 who worked in personnel for the Miami Dolphins and had been an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts. Rozelle had discussed the hiring before hand with former Giants Frank Gifford and Tom Scott, who recommended hiring Young. They had already recommended Young to Wellington and his son John, but felt if Rozelle presented the recommendation as his own idea the brothers would be more likely to accept the pick. Young was hired and he was instrumental in turning around the fortunes of the franchise. [...] "Oh, there is no question he helped save the franchise", John Mara later said. [...] "It looked like a no-win situation. He came in and overhauled everything we <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more professional way." [...] Despite the hiring and subsequent success, the rift between the Maras lasted for several years and, at one point a partition had to be put between the two in the owner's box.|$|E
