5|$|Despite Tchaikovsky's {{disdain for}} public life, he now {{participated in it}} as part of his {{increasing}} celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music.

5|$|Despite his staunch Catholicism, Joaquim Inácio {{became a}} freemason, joining the Loja Integridade Maçônica (Freemasonry Integrity Lodge) in 1828. He {{eventually}} {{rose to the}} highest ranks of that lodge, becoming Deputy Grand Master in 1863. He was also accorded membership in other Brazilian lodges, became an honorary member of Portuguese Freemasonry and was {{a representative of the}} Grand Orient de France in Brazil. Freemasonry opened new venues for Joaquim Inácio, providing him with connections and influence he had previously lacked and which were essential to advancing his political career. On 2 March 1861, his friend Caxias, also a freemason and staunch Catholic, became prime minister. <b>He</b> <b>invited</b> Joaquim Inácio, who {{became a member of the}} Conservative Party, to assume the naval ministry's portfolio.

They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's defeat {{also changed}} the {{religious}} {{balance in the}} northwestern states. Although the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had addressed earlier the problem of religious pluralism, the solution potentially converted simple, and usually local, legal disputes into dynastic and religious warfare, as the Cologne War itself demonstrated. The result of the Cologne War gave the Counter Reformation {{a foothold in the}} lower Rhine. Ernst was a product of Jesuit education. Once his position was secured, <b>he</b> <b>invited</b> Jesuits into the territory to help re-establish Catholicism, a task which the Order approached zealously. They ejected Protestant pastors from parishes, sometimes by force, and re-established catechism education and pastoral visitations. Even when communities appeared to be reconverted, the Jesuits maintained strict supervision to identify recalcitrant Protestants or backsliders. The Jesuit reintroduction of Catholicism postponed the solution of Germany's religious problems for another half century.|$|E

5|$|In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado camped outside Q'umarkaj. <b>He</b> <b>invited</b> the K'iche' lords Oxib-Keh (the ajpop, or king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the ajpop k'amha, or king elect) {{to visit}} him in his camp.

In {{response}} to a furious K'iche' counterattack, Alvarado had the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city. After the destruction of Q'umarkaj, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance. Alvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400. With the capitulation of the K'iche' kingdom, various non-K'iche' peoples under K'iche' dominion also submitted to the Spanish. This included the Mam inhabitants of the area now within the modern department of San Marcos.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause.

In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business.
