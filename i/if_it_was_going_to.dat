It eventually nominated Natsagiin Udval to run. Udval is the Minister of Health and the Secretary-General of Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

Udval supports former president Nambaryn Enkhbayar who is in prison on corruption charges and who is chairman of Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.|$|E
500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be some kind of}} paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{was seen}} as having a {{classical}} technique. While batting, he stood very straight and side on to the bowler. His off-driving was powerful, his defence was excellent, and he was superb at judging {{the line of the}} ball and letting it pass by <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> miss his wickets. His on-side play was also excellent, being able to place the ball between fielders for easy runs. Christopher Douglas described Jardine as [...] "the epitome of the old-fashioned amateur". However, he also comments that his approach to batting was like that of a professional and that his back-foot batting was of a quality that few amateurs could manage. In 1928, Wisden's correspondent described Jardine as the most secure amateur batsman of the time, and identified his greatest strength as his defence and his [...] "mental gifts." [...] He played very straight and hit the ball hard in defence, but could not play all the strokes, particularly on the off side. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Jardine had modelled himself on C. B. Fry. He also noted that Jardine displayed good concentration, a strong desire to improve his batting and a fighting spirit that brought out his best in a crisis. He also said that Jardine could play every recognised cricket shot, but would not do so in a match and Robertson-Glasgow believed it was Jardine's one weakness as a batsman. The more important the occasion, the more defensive and restricted Jardine's batting became: [...] "In general, as the task grew greater, the strokes grew fewer." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Adam Scott, who also appeared in the subsequent season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and became a regular cast member during the third season. Scott left the Starz comedy Party Down to join the Parks and Recreation cast, a decision he made {{in part because it}} was unclear whether Starz would renew the series: [...] "It was a matter of me asking Starz <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue, and them saying they weren't ready to make that decision. I couldn't pass up the opportunity on Parks and Rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore." [...] Schur said when the Ben Wyatt character was written, Scott was envisioned as the [...] "dream scenario" [...] for casting. Schur described Scott as [...] "brilliant and funny" [...] and praised his comedic range: [...] "There just aren't that many people with a comedic range that spans Step Brothers to Party Down.". Several commentators said Ben Wyatt closely resembles the character Scott played on Party Down, Henry Pollard. While Ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall, Henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined. Scott, however, said he feels they are [...] "vastly different characters and circumstances". The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the series of Parks and Recreation in general, but one that was ultimately not used until the Ben Wyatt character was introduced. During the scene when Ben explains his failed mayoral tenure, shots of a newspaper clip with images of the character's prom pictures are shown. Those pictures are the actual high school prom photos of actor Adam Scott.|$|E
2500|$|The Millennium Development Goals {{aimed at}} halving {{the share of}} people without {{sustainable}} access to an improved water source and improved sanitation by 2015 compared to 1990. In 2006 the United Nations Development Programme estimated that concerning urban and rural water supply as well as urban sanitation, the targets will be achieved prematurely, whereas rural sanitation progress was classified to be [...] "on track".

He speculated that the project might mark the time when society stops using large iconic projects as a tool for lifting areas out of deprivation. He questioned its ability to draw people's attention to Stratford after the Games, in a similar manner to the successes of the Angel of the North or the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. He also questioned the piece's ability to strike a chord like the Angel, which he believed had at least [...] "created a feelgood factor and sense of pride" [...] in Gateshead, or whether it would simply become one of the [...] "many more unloved rotting wrecks that no one has the nerve to demolish". He postulated that the addition of stairs and a lift made Orbit less succinct than Kapoor's previous successful works, while ultimately he said [...] "hard to see what the big idea is, beyond the idea of making something big".|$|E

2500|$|The {{music for}} [...] "Stand Amid the Roar" [...] {{was written by}} Rousseau before he had joined the band. Told mention that the group [...] "weren't sure at first <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a great fit". Rousseau showed a demo of [...] "Stand Amid the Roar" [...] to the band and that was [...] "all it took {{for him to get}} in the band!", as Told revealed. [...] "On Brave Mountains We Conquer", and its {{counterpart}} [...] "In Silent Seas We Drown", are the most autobiographical songs on the album. [...] "On Brave Mountains We Conquer" [...] also talks about settling down and giving up one's dreams. The lyrics of [...] "Massachusetts" [...] refer to an abusive relationship and the problems one faces with it. The band nearly thought about not recording the song due to its similarity to another Silverstein song. As a compromise, the group [...] "changed it around slightly" [...] according to Told. The tracks [...] "This Is How" [...] and [...] "The Wind Shifts" [...] were written and recorded at the same time. Told notes that they are a summary of the album and that they [...] "symbolize how similar everyone is regardless of how different they seem externally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that {{was the nature of}} the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether {{you were going to get}} one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.|$|E

50|$|The Carhart four-factor {{model is}} an {{extension}} of the Fama-French three-factor model including a momentum factor, also known in the industry as the MOM factor (monthly momentum). Momentum in a stock is described as the tendency for the stock price to continue rising <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> up and to continue declining <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> down. The MOM can be calculated by subtracting the equal weighted average of the lowest performing firms from the equal weighed average of the highest performing firms, lagged one month (Carhart, 1997). A stock is showing momentum if its prior 12-month average of returns is positive. Similar to the three factor model, momentum factor is defined by self-financing portfolio of (long positive momentum)+(short negative momentum). Momentum strategies continue to be popular in financial markets such that financial analysts incorporate the 52-week price high/low in their Buy/Sell recommendations.|$|R
