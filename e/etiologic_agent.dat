As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children.

25|$|The hantaviruses are a {{relatively}} newly discovered genus of viruses. An outbreak of Korean hemorrhagic fever among American and Korean soldiers during the Korean War (1950–1953) was later {{found to be}} caused by a hantavirus infection. More than 3000 troops became ill with symptoms that included renal failure, generalized hemorrhage, and shock. It had a 10 percent mortality rate. This outbreak sparked a 25-year search for the <b>etiologic</b> <b>agent.</b> Ho-Wang Lee, a South Korean virologist, Karl M.

Additional viral strains have also been isolated from P. maniculatus associated with a fatal case in California and P. leucopus from the vicinity of probable infection of a New York case.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the spectrum of}} <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> causing community associated UTI and their antimicrobial resistance trends in a large teaching hospital in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Methods: A retrospective review of the microbiology laboratory records of four hundred ninety two cases of community associated UTI between April 2006 and March 2007 was carried out. <b>Etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were analyzed. Results: A wide spectrum of uropathogens was isolated of which the leading <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> of community associated UTI were Escherichia coli (207 strains) and Klebsiella species (90 strains). Sixty-six per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 58. 5 % were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and more than 50 % were resistant to cephalexin. How- ever, resistance rate to antimicrobials like ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone remain relatively low 9. 7 % and 7. 6 % respectively. Conclusions: Escherichia coli remains {{the leading cause of}} community associated UTI. In-vitro antimicrobial resistance pattern of the isolates revealed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin and amoxycillin the commonly used first- line antimicrobials were becoming less and less effective in their treatment.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) remains a controversial matter, but, {{in the last}} few years, considerable evidence suggests that aberrations of the immune system and viruses may act as <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents,</b> in at least some cases of NHL. In fact, patients with primary immuno-deficiencies, or those suffering from diseases characterized by autoimmune dysfunction, show an increased risk for the development of NHL. Several viruses have been identified as possible <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> for NHL; one of the best studied is the Epstein-Barr virus, which was detected in cultures of tumor cells from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. The pathogenetic potential of this virus is illustrated by its association with an increasing number of malignant diseases. In addition, the human T-cell lymphotropic virus family (HTLV), was also recognized as possible <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> for several lymphomas, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and T-cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome (HTLV-I), and T-cell hairy cell leukemia (HTLV-II). Recently, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection has also been recognized in several hematological malignancies such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, low-grade malignant lymphomas and Waldenström's disease.

40|$|Different zoonoses whose <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> were {{previously}} unknown {{have been identified}} in recent years as a result of new diagnostic techniques in molecular biology and improved epidemiological surveillance systems. Several factors have facilitated the emergence of new diseases and the re-emergence of already known diseases, which were thought to be under control. They include the following: (1) environmental changes, such as deforestation and droughts, which allow <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> and their vectors to thrive, (2) industrial food production for widespread consumption, which allows disease agents to spread quickly, (3) certain risky human habits, especially among immuno-compromised persons, such as having exotic pets at home, and (4) the adaptation of <b>etiologic</b> <b>agents</b> to new environmental conditions through the development of drug resistance. Other factors, such as the disruption of established health systems during the process of privatization, have also contributed to the situation. In most cases, bacterial zoonoses can be prevented through good personal and domestic hygiene and common sense.
