40|$|In March 1999 the European Council, {{meeting in}} Berlin, agreed a {{reform of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which {{superseded}} a deal the ministers of agriculture agreed – or thought they had agreed – two weeks earlier. This article seeks {{an explanation of the}} nature of the second reform, before indicating briefly why further reform will be needed. In suggesting possible directions for reform, three options discussed but not agreed upon during negotiations are examined: <b>degressivity</b> (the reduction over time of direct payments), cofinancing (sharing CAP budget costs between EU and national budgets) and modulation (targeting support towards smaller farms). <b>Degressivity</b> offers the best way of containing budget costs. Accompanied by the elimination of price support, this will facilitate agreement in international trade talks and accommodate enlargement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Degressivity</b> of {{unemployment}} benefits {{is a major}} feature of social protection in most industrialised countries: the replacement rate (the ratio between the level of welfare benefits and the previous income) typically declines with {{the length of the}} unemployment spell. Moreover <b>degressivity</b> {{of unemployment}} benefits has significant distributive effects as the risk of long-term unemployment varies from one individual to another. This paper proposes a formal model of political support for unemployment insurance that takes into account the decrease in the level of benefits over time. A discount factor is introduced that diminishes the level of benefits for long-term unemployed. The main predictions of our model are the following: i) Unemployment insurance size negatively depends on both the average level and the heterogeneity of unemployment risk ii) The <b>degressivity</b> increases with the average level and the heterogeneity in the individual level of employability defined as the probability of finding a job when unemployed. These predictions are then tested using a dataset of 24 OECD countries. Empirical results are consistent with the model.

30|$|In {{terms of}} policy implications, {{the present study}} {{suggests}} {{that the decision to}} opt for a partial convergence model (instead of a flat rate model) as well as for <b>degressivity</b> and capping mechanisms (instead of activating the redistributive payment) has somewhat limited the redistributive effect of direct payments in Italy. In this regard, recent evidence confirms that the impact of the application of these specific redistributive tools (such as <b>degressivity</b> and capping) in Italy is limited. On the other hand, if Italy had used the same amount of public resources used for the voluntary couple support (which is concentrated in the upper decile of the population by farm income) for the redistributive payments and/or for the payments for mountain areas, it is likely that a more equitable distribution of DPs could have been obtained.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, {{the present}} paper allows avenues for future {{research}} in this field to be outlined. Such research may involve quantitative analyses aimed at evaluating the redistributive effect of direct payments and the impacts on concentration with particular attention to the territorial and sectoral impacts. Attention should be paid to the comparisons of different scenarios characterized by the application of alternative (i) criteria for both internal and external convergence of direct payments, (ii) redistributive mechanisms/tools (<b>degressivity,</b> capping), and (iii) targeted payments focused on redistributive objectives.|$|E
30|$|In Italy, <b>degressivity</b> {{is applied}} since the {{voluntary}} redistributive payments {{have not been}} implemented. To generate a more equitable distribution of direct payments, a mandatory reduction in BPS by 50 % for the part exceeding 150, 000 € is introduced. Moreover, this percentage is 100 % for the part exceeding 500, 000 €, thereby introducing a de facto “capping” on BPS. In Italy, such a reduction is applied after deducting labor costs for the previous year, i.e., salaries to employees as well as taxes paid and social welfare contributions, from the basic payment.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{the linkage}} between land and direct {{payments}} is always present {{in the background and}} strongly affects the correlation with farm income level and the redistributive effect of these types of aid. Moreover, especially in case of the flat rate, it exacerbates the transfer of public income support to land prices, reducing the effectiveness of the redistributive role of direct payments. Therefore, to obtain a better redistribution of payments, testing alternative parameters for allocating direct payments that substitute for or are combined with the current parameter (land) could be more effective than continuing to focus attention on redistributive tools/mechanisms (flat rate models, external convergence, <b>degressivity,</b> capping) or payments that can only reduce, but not eliminate, redistributive distortions caused by the connection between land and direct payments.|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of the first payroll tax {{reductions}} implemented in France in the 90 s on the wage dynamics of low-income employees. Since these policies represent a net transfer from the State to the employer/employee match, they are unlikely to lead to wage reductions for employees of a given productivity level. However, the <b>degressivity</b> of such payroll tax reductions leads to a concave link between wage and productivity such that for given productivity changes, wage increases are lower once the payroll tax reductions are implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the validity of this low-wage trap hypothesis. Our first empirical strategy simply consists in comparing the evolution of wage increases for employees benefiting from the payroll tax reductions with those of the closest individuals in terms of wages, but not affected by these reductions. This difference-in-difference strategy shows that low-wage employees were more likely than medium-wage employees to get a raise in 1997 than they were in 1994, when payroll tax reductions were only marginal. The substantial minimum wage increase in the period makes it hard, though, to interpret these results causally. Our second empirical strategy compares the individual wage evolutions of a near-to-minimum wage employee between 1994 and 1998 with that of a similar individual but for the 1984 - 1988 period. We observe no significant differential evolutions. Overall, our results suggest that payroll tax reductions did not decrease the expected income of low-wage employees, at least in the short or medium run.
