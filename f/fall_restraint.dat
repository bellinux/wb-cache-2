5000|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>restraint</b> is a {{class of}} {{personal}} protective equipment to prevent persons {{who are in a}} fall hazard area from falling, e.g., <b>fall</b> <b>restraint</b> lanyards. Typically, <b>fall</b> <b>restraint</b> will physically prevent a worker from approaching an edge.|$|E
50|$|Fall arrest is {{the form}} of fall {{protection}} which involves the safe stopping of a person already falling. It {{is one of several}} forms of fall protection, forms which also include fall guarding (general protection that prevents persons from entering a fall hazard area e.g., guard rails) and <b>fall</b> <b>restraint</b> (personal protection which prevents persons who are in a fall hazard area from falling, e.g., <b>fall</b> <b>restraint</b> lanyards).|$|E
50|$|In rock climbing, {{an anchor}} {{can be any}} device or method for {{attaching}} a climber, a rope, or a load to the climbing surface - typically rock, ice, steep dirt, or a building - either permanently or temporarily. The intention of an anchor is case-specific but is usually for fall protection, primarily fall arrest and <b>fall</b> <b>restraint.</b> Climbing anchors are also used for hoisting, holding static loads, or redirecting (sometimes called deviating) a rope.|$|E
50|$|Besides prompt {{antibiotic}} treatment, supportive {{measure for}} organ failure (such as cardiac decompensation) are also important. Another consideration goes to hospital referral; although more severe pneumonia requires admission to an acute care facility, this also predisposes to hazards of hospitalization such as delirium, urinary incontinence, depression, <b>falls,</b> <b>restraint</b> use, functional decline, adverse drug effects and hospital infections. Therefore, mild pneumonia {{might be better}} dealt with inside the long term care facility. In patients with a limited life expectancy (for example, those with advanced dementia), end-of-life pneumonia also requires recognition and appropriate, palliative care.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Predictive {{models for}} falls, injury <b>falls,</b> and <b>restraint</b> {{prevalence}} were explored within nursing unit structures and processes of care. BACKGROUND: The patient care team {{is responsible for}} patient safety, and improving practice models may prevent injuries and improve patient safety. METHODS: Using unit-level self-reported data from 215 hospitals, falls, injury <b>falls,</b> and <b>restraint</b> prevalence were modeled with significant covariates as predictors. RESULTS: Fewer falls/injury falls were predicted by populations with fewer frail and at-risk patients, more unlicensed care hours, and prevention protocol implementation, but not staffing per se, restraint use, or RN expertise. Lower restraint use was predicted by fewer frail patients, shorter length of stay, more RN hours, more certified RNs, and implementation of fall prevention protocols. CONCLUSION: In the presence of risk, patient injuries and safety were improved by optimizing staffing skill mix and use of prevention protocols...|$|R
50|$|Medical {{restraints}} {{are generally}} {{used to prevent}} people with severe physical or mental disorders from harming themselves or others. A major goal of most medical restraints is to prevent injuries due to <b>falls.</b> Other medical <b>restraints</b> are intended to prevent a harmful behavior, such as hitting people.|$|R
40|$|Unprotected {{falls from}} {{elevation}} usually result in serious debilitating injury or death. Falls {{can be prevented}} {{through the use of}} proper prevention and arrest systems. All work from elevated work surfaces will be accomplished without any risk of falling to a lower level. This goal is achieved by adhering to the following fall protection hierarchy: 1. Remove the hazard: avoid working at heights. Bring the work down to the ground level whenever possible. 2. If work at heights is unavoidable, secure the elevated work area with a passive fall prevention barrier system, such as guardrails. 3. When a barrier system is not feasible because of the physical characteristics of the work environment or the infrequency of access, use an approved <b>fall</b> <b>restraint</b> system. 4. If no other option is feasible, a properly engineered and approved fall arrest system can be used in conjunction with a rescue plan. 1. 1 Hazards / Impacts Falls and subsequent injury may occur because of � Lack of fixed, guarded, work platform...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether individualized advice on non-pharmacological strategies for hospitalized older patients with confusion {{and behavioral problems}} can improve levels of agitation and reduce the use of psychotropic medication. METHOD: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial in two metropolitan teaching hospitals in South Australia. Seventy-one older patients with confusion and a behavioral disturbance were randomly allocated to receive either an assessment and ongoing individualized advice from an extended practice nurse on non-pharmacological strategies or usual care. Usual care included an assessment by a geriatrician. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were levels of agitation (Pittsburgh Agitation Scale), appropriateness of psychotropic medication prescribing (Medication Appropriateness Index) and levels of psychotropics administered (chlorpromazine and diazepam dose equivalents). Secondary outcomes were length of stay, discharge destination, number of <b>falls,</b> <b>restraint</b> use and satisfaction from nursing staff and next of kin. RESULTS: Levels of agitation were modest at baseline with mean PAS intervention group 3. 4 (SD = 0. 5) and control group 4. 0 (SD = 0. 4) and both groups improved over time to 1. 7 (SD = 0. 4) for the intervention group and 1. 8 (SD = 0. 3) {{for the control group}} {{on the final day of}} data collection. Median length of follow-up was nine days. There was no effect of the intervention on levels of agitation, amount and appropriateness of psychotropic medication prescribed and administered, falls, length of stay, discharge destination, restraint use and nursing and next of kin satisfaction. CONCLUSION: A nursing consultation service providing individualized non-pharmacological advice does not improve patient agitation or use of psychotropic medication for older patients with confusion and behavioral problems in an acute hospital.

40|$|AbstractObjectivePhysical {{restraints}} {{are associated}} with severe side effects and suffering. A comprehensive, person-centered, methodology was implemented in 41 Spanish nursing homes to safely eliminate restraints. MethodsData were collected in 2 waves: September 2011 (at {{the beginning of the}} intervention, n =  4361) and September 2014 (n =  5051). Use of 10 different types of physical restraints was recorded, as well as frequency of psychotropic medication prescription, falls, and mortality. ResultsMean age was 83. 4 (SD 8. 5) and 63. 5 % of the residents had dementia. Frequency (95 % confidence interval) of people having at least 1 restraint was reduced from 18. 1 % (17. 0 – 19. 3) to 1. 6 % (1. 3 – 2. 0). Use of benzodiazepines was also reduced, with no significant changes in other psychotropic medications and mortality. The rate of total falls increased from 13. 1 % (12. 1 – 14. 1) to 16. 1 % (15. 1 – 17. 1), with no significant increase in injurious <b>falls.</b> ConclusionPhysical <b>restraints</b> can almost completely be eliminated with reasonable levels of safety...|$|R
5000|$|The {{focus of}} CIMT is to combine {{restraint}} of the unaffected limb and intensive {{use of the}} affected limb. Types of restraints include a sling or triangular bandage, a splint, a sling combined with a resting hand splint, a half glove, and a mitt. [...] Determination {{of the type of}} restraint used for therapy depends on the required level of safety vs. intensity of therapy. Some restraints restrict the wearer from using their hand and wrist, though allow use of their non-involved upper extremity for protection by extension of their arm in case of loss of balance or <b>falls.</b> However, <b>restraints</b> that allow some use of the non-involved extremity will result in less intensive practice because the non-involved arm can still be used in complete tasks. [...] Constraint typically consists of placing a mitt on the unaffected hand or a sling or splint on the unaffected arm, forcing the use of the affected limb with the goal of promoting purposeful movements when performing functional tasks. The use of the affected limb is called shaping.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{whether there was}} any relationship between <b>fall</b> and <b>restraint</b> rates prior to and after implementation of a restraint reduction program in an old age home. Demographic and clinical data on subject variables were collected for statistical analysis over three time periods, each lasting 12 months - 1995 (T 1), 1997 (T 2), and 1998 (T 3). T 1 was one year prior to joint efforts by the Home and a Community Geriatric Assessment Service. T 2 and T 3 were the two consecutive years after restraint reduction interventions were progressively instituted in 1996. Subjects included residents of the Care and Attention (C & A) section of the Home within the three time periods. Treating subjects in T 1, T 1 and T 3 as three independent samples showed no significant differences comparing <b>restraint</b> rates and <b>fall</b> rates between the time periods. Significant difference was noted, however, when comparing "insignificant/minor falls" against "serious falls" (p= 0. 040) between T 1 and T 2. The {{decrease in the number}} of "serious falls" remained stable in T 3. Although the number of falls neither increased nor decreased in the three time periods, the absolute number of minor falls increased and the number serious falls decreased after implementing the fall prevention program. The degree of change was stable two years after program implementation. The number of falls a resident sustained had a low level of correlation with his/her restraint status. Study findings show that the restraint reduction program resulted in some positive outcomes for Home residents. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|Over time, chronic {{conditions}} like dementia {{can lead to}} care dependency and nursing care problems, often necessitating nursing home admission. This panel study (2012 - 2014) aims to explore changes in care dependency and nursing care problems (incontinence, malnutrition, decubitus, <b>falls</b> and <b>restraints)</b> in residents with and without dementia over time. In total, nine Austrian nursing homes participated, including 258 residents (178 with, 80 without dementia) who completed all five measurements. Data were collected with the International Prevalence Measurement of Care Problems questionnaire, the Care Dependency Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination- 2. Repeated measures ANOVA and crosstabs were used to analyse changes. The results showed that care dependency in dementia residents increased significantly for all 15 items of the Care Dependency Scale, with the highest increase being residents' day-/night pattern, contact with others, sense of rules/values and communication. In contrast, care dependency in residents without dementia increased for four of the 15 items, with the highest increase being for continence, followed by getting (un) dressed. With respect to the assessed nursing care problems, residents with dementia and those without only differed significantly {{in terms of an}} increase in urinary- (12. 3 % vs. 14. 2 %), fecal- (17. 4 % vs. 10 %), and double incontinence (16. 7 % vs. 11. 9 %). The results indicated that residents with dementia experienced increased care dependency in different areas than residents without dementia. Furthermore, residents with dementia experienced a lower increase in urinary incontinence but a higher increase in fecal- and double incontinence.

Its central aim is to shed historicizing light on the trajectory of judicial activism by imaginatively rifling through an array of canonical and somewhat-less-than-canonical empirical identification strategies. Two conclusions follow from the inquiry. First, I find that the available data on the historical trajectory of judicial restraint are surprisingly poor, and {{it is necessary to}} offer any judgment about the historical path of judicial activism with great caution. Second, although the empirical record is fragmentary, some common points emerge from the use of divergent methodologies. Specifically, I suggest that the temporal domain of judicial activism should be expanded further back into American history than generally assumed It was {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Civil War that judicial behavior changed in a consequential way.

40|$|General {{practitioners}} provide most of {{the medical}} care for people with dementia who live in residential aged care facilities. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) including psychosis, depression, agitation, aggression, and disinhibition, often occur. These affront the person’s dignity and well being and are often managed with psychotropic medications. Cholinesterase inhibitors are of no benefit in reducing these behaviours. Aims: This study evaluates {{the effectiveness of the}} ‘Spark of Life’ program, a social therapeutic, person-centred care program, which aims to improve memory, language, communication, social interaction, and behaviours. BPSD and associated variables were assessed as key outcome measures. Method: A small n case multiple baseline design was employed to assess the impact on behaviours, depression, pain, activity including <b>falls,</b> use of <b>restraint,</b> sleep, and requirements for antipsychotic, antidepressant and hypnotic medications. Data was obtained from people with dementia, their caregivers, and family members. Results: Continuous assessment of BPSD outcome measures over 8 months will be presented in graphical format for several residents with mild to moderate dementia. Related outcomes for carers and families will also be presented. Conclusions: The impact of this program on the wellbeing of residents may provide an effective non-pharmacological approach to the prevention and management of BPSD, enabling a reduction in the use of psychotropic medications...|$|R
40|$|Patient {{safety culture}} (PSC) is a {{critical}} factor in creating high reliability healthcare organizations. However, few studies to date have correlated PSC measures with actual safety outcomes. In particular, nursing home studies have only recently appeared in the literature. Nursing homes differ from hospitals in {{that the vast majority of}} direct care is provided by certified nursing assistants (CNAs), not licensed nurses. Thus nursing home PSC could differ in important ways from PSC in acute care institutions. This dissertation was a secondary data analysis that examined whether CNAs’ perceptions of patient safety culture were correlated with clinical outcomes in a random sample of 74 nursing homes in five randomly selected states. This study matched CNA PSC survey data using the Hospital Survey of Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) with Minimum Data Set (MDS), Area Resource File (ARF) and Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) data from those same homes during the first two quarters of 2005. In the original study, 1579 nurse aides out of 2872 completed the survey, for a 55 % response rate. In addition to clinical outcomes, this study examined the relationship between CNA PSC scores and staff turnover. The relationship between certain demographic variables, such as level of education, tenure as a CNA, and PSC scores was evaluated. The relationship between certain facility characteristics, such as profit status and bed occupancy was also assessed. An exploratory factor analysis of the original HSOPSC instrument was re-run for this nursing home CNA sample. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression and multilevel techniques; descriptive statistics were compiled for demographic data. Major findings from the regression analyses and combined GEE models suggest that certain factors, such as CNA turnover and LPN staffing may predict CNA PSC scores. CNA PSC scores were associated with rates of <b>falls</b> and <b>restraint</b> use, but were not associated with differences in pressure ulcer rates in this sample. Few associations for CNA PSC with individual subscales were identified. The exploratory factor analysis revealed some potential differences in how items and subscales factored in this nursing home CNA population. This dissertation represents an important step in the evaluation of CNA PSC in nursing homes and the relationship of PSC to safety outcomes. Future work on nursing home PSC and clinical and workforce outcomes is described...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This report {{presents}} {{estimates for}} U. S. nursing homes, their current residents, and staff, {{based on results}} from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). Facility data are summarized by facility characteristics and include new data items on special care units and programs, formal contracts with agencies and providers, end-of-life care programs, and electronic information systems. Current residents are presented by characteristics such as demographics, health and functional status, and services received, with new data items on advance directives, <b>falls,</b> use of <b>restraints,</b> hospitalizations, pain management, and medications. The discussion highlights key survey findings, including differences in selected national estimates between the 2004 NNHS and the 1999 survey. Methods: The 2004 NNHS consisted of a two-stage design with a probability sample of 1, 500 nursing facilities {{in the first stage}} and up to 12 current residents from each facility in the second stage. This nationally representative sample survey was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics from August 2004 through January 2005. Results: In 2004, an estimated 1. 5 million current residents received nursing home care in 16, 100 facilities, the majority of which were proprietary (61. 5 %) and were located in the Midwest and in the South. Most full-time equivalent employees of the facilities were nursing staff. Most current residents were aged 65 years and older (88. 3 %), female (71. 2 %), and white (85. 5 %). Nearly one-half (48. 2 %) of all residents were admitted from a hospital or health care facility other than a nursing home or assisted-living-type facility, and 65. 3 % of all residents had some kind of advance directive.

40|$|Physical <b>restraint</b> use and <b>falls</b> {{are common}} in {{institutional}} care of old people and various {{attempts have been made}} to reduce their occurrence. Falls and concomitant injuries are a major problem due to their negative effect on morbidity and mortality. Prevention of falls and injuries is the most common reason for physically restraining old people in institutional care. Its use has, however, been questioned both from an ethical perspective, since restraints can be perceived as coercive and also because of the lack of sound evidence of their effectiveness in preventing falls, as well as the adverse effects associated with their use. The main purposes of this thesis were to investigate differences in the us of physical restraints over time, to identifify risk factors for falls among people with dementia, to evaluate the effects of a restraint minimization program on staff knowledge, attitudes, and work environment and use of physical restraints and the quality of care. The present thesis is based on three main data collections, two census surveys conducted within institutional care for old people in the county of Västerbotten in 2000 (n= 3, 804) and 2007 (n= 2, 970) and one cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) including 40 group dwellings for people suffering from dementia where the intervention consisted of staff education. The use of physical restraints increased slightly between 2000 and 2007 (16. 2 % to 18. 4 %, p= 0. 016). Analyses suggest that the increase might be independent of any change in resident characteristics. Restrained residents were also subjected to restraints for longer times in 2007. During a six-month follow-up 64 / 160 (40. 0 %) residents in group dwellings for those with dementia sustained at least one fall. Independent risk factors for falls were ‘requiring help with hygiene’, ‘displaying verbally disruptive/attention-seeking behavior’, ‘able to rise from a chair’, ‘walking with assistive devices’, and ‘participating in outdoor walks’, which explained 36. 1 % of the falls. The majority of the 191 falls were un-witnessed, 35 % occurred during the night and anxiety and confusion were the most common symptoms preceding the <b>falls.</b> A six-month <b>restraint</b> minimization program showed a positive impact on staff knowledge, attitudes and work environment as well as on the use of physical restraints and subjectively estimated quality of care. Residents in the intervention group present throughout the entire study period had lower odds, relative to the residents in the control group of being physically restrained at follow-up (OR= 0. 21, CI 95 %= 0. 08 - 0. 57) after controlling for potential confounders and the cluster effect. Adjusted analyses including all residents present at either baseline or follow-up also showed that the use of physical restraints was less in the intervention group relative to the control group at follow-up. There was no change in the occurrence of falls or use of psychoactive drugs. The intervention also reduced stress of conscience, job demands and strain in the staff, and improved their job control and the caring climate. Subgroup analysis indicated a greater effect in units where the use of physical restraints had been reduced or remained constant. In conclusion, physical <b>restraint</b> use and <b>falls</b> remains common in institutional care of old people. The practice of physical restraint seems to have changed. In the RCT it was found that it is possible to change restraint practice and also to improve staff work environment. Falls among residents with dementia require a certain mobility function and anxiety and confusion are common symptoms preceding falls...|$|R
