40|$|The thesis will propose an {{analysis}} of the social movement theory and a comparison of the political and social contexts of the two <b>Green</b> <b>Movements</b> in East and West Germany. The resemblances and differences will then be linked to the social movement theory and be justified. As a matter of fact, the social movement theory will be used as a tool to explain the similar formation of the two <b>Green</b> <b>Movements.</b> This will allow studying the <b>Green</b> <b>Movements</b> in East and West Germany with an innovative sociological vision completing the already existing historical analysis of both movements. The formation of the movements that corresponds to the gathering of the core elements necessary for collective action to be qualified as a social movement, are the focus of the thesis...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary proliferating <b>Green</b> <b>movements</b> deeply {{roots in}} the process of {{globalization}} and neoliberal politics. With the facilitation of new technology, <b>Green</b> <b>movements</b> seem to become the novel vehicle to transcend the national, class, gender and racial borders. Meanwhile, ecofeminism raises the debates on woman nature nexus and posits woman at the forefront of fighting environmental crisis. This thesis parallels the two trajectories in the temporal and spatial contexts of cyborg space, ???global city??? and international environmental governance. This thesis unfolds the inherent connections, as well as contradictions in these spaces. Through scrutinizing the techniques of subjectivity in <b>Green</b> <b>movements</b> and ecofeminism, it examines the female subjects that are maneuvered, mobilized and displaced in the intersectional power dynamics of gender, class, race, sexuality and nationality of the neoliberal politics. Integrating transnational feminism, queer studies and ecofeminism, this thesis endeavors to pave new spaces for rethinking possible grounds for alliances in the neoliberal era...|$|R

25|$|Rumours {{suggested}} that the protesters would include university students, lorry drivers, and gold merchants from across the country, who were protesting under the umbrella opposition known as the <b>Green</b> <b>movement</b> the re-emergence {{of which had been}} inspired by the recent events in Egypt and Tunisia. The Revolutionary Guard promised to forcefully confront protesters, and opposition activists and aides to Mousavi and Karroubi were arrested {{in the days leading up}} to the demonstrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} that followed {{led to the}} consolidation of the small <b>green</b> <b>movement</b> that had been born out of the non-violent protest campaign against the building of three dams on Lake Pedder in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between {{the announcement of the}} dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, {{there was}} a {{restricted}} political opportunity structure within Kenya because the government {{at the time was}} very politically repressive. The framing of the <b>Green</b> Belt <b>Movement</b> as a non threatening environmental conservation effort allowed this organization to make an impact during a time that many other forms of activism were seen as threats to the government. However, by encouraging women to question their place and challenge social and political institutions that keep women compliant the <b>Green</b> Belt <b>Movement</b> was eventually challenged by the government. In the late 1980s the <b>Green</b> Belt <b>Movement</b> was being harassed at the grassroots level within communities and at the central office. For example, the <b>Green</b> Belt <b>Movement</b> was evicted from their government-owned office they had worked in for 10 years. The <b>Green</b> Belt <b>Movement</b> now highlights the focus on direct social and economic transformation of communities to ensure they are not identified as having a political agenda. By highlighting the lack of direct threat, this organization is able to function without alarming the decision-making elite who currently benefit from the inequities in Kenya.|$|R

25|$|Kovel criticises many {{within the}} <b>Green</b> <b>movement</b> {{for not being}} overtly anti-capitalist, for working within the {{existing}} capitalist, statist system, for voluntarism, or for reliance on technological fixes.

25|$|The Green Party traces {{its origins}} to the Values Party, the world's first national-level {{environmentalist}} party. The Values Party originated in 1972 at Victoria University of Wellington. While it gained {{a measure of}} public support in several elections, the then first-past-the-post electoral system meant that the party did not win any seats in parliament. Some of the founding members of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, notably Jeanette Fitzsimons, Rod Donald and Mike Ward, had been active members of the Values Party {{at the outset of}} the <b>Green</b> <b>movement</b> in the 1970s.|$|E

In the elections themselves, which saw the Green Party gain over 2 million votes (14.5% of the national poll), Wall received 15% of the vote in the Bristol constituency. During his time in the Green Party, Wall has been a Parish Councillor.|$|E
