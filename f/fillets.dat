40|$|<b>Fillet</b> {{weight is}} an {{economically}} important trait in Nile tilapia production for the European market which asks for fish with average body weights {{of at least}} 700 g. Genetic parameters to design or optimize breeding programs for these body weights are lacking. In an earlier study we showed that high phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and low phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yield. To evaluate the potential of mass selection for <b>fillet</b> traits, however, genetic parameters are required. The aim {{of the current study}} was to estimate genetic parameters for body weight, <b>fillet</b> weight, <b>fillet</b> yield and body measurements. Therefore, slaughter data was collected on 1884 pedigreed Nile tilapias. Measurements of body weight, length, width, corrected (=fillet) length and head length were taken on each fish. <b>Filleting</b> machines were used to <b>fillet</b> fish and measurements of <b>fillet</b> weight, <b>fillet</b> yield and head weight were collected. Subsequently, genetic parameters were estimated. Heritabilities were 0. 26 for body weight, 0. 24 for <b>fillet</b> weight and 0. 12 for <b>fillet</b> yield. The genetic correlation between body weight and <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 99 and between body weight and <b>fillet</b> yield 0. 74. The genetic correlation between <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 81. Genetic correlations between <b>fillet</b> weight and body measurements were 0. 89 for length, 0. 70 for head length, 0. 94 for width and 0. 91 for corrected length. Genetic correlations between <b>fillet</b> yield and body measurements were 0. 62 for length, 0. 47 for head length, 0. 98 for width and 0. 60 for corrected length. The potential of mass selection aiming to improve <b>fillet</b> weight was evaluated by a number of selection indexes. The accuracy of a selection index including only body weight indicated that in this way almost the same amount of the selection response could be achieved compared to what hypothetical direct selection for <b>fillet</b> weight would. The use of only width in the selection index would result in 8. 5 % lower selection response than the use of body weight. We conclude that body weight is the best predictor for <b>fillet</b> weight compared to body measurement...|$|R

40|$|In Nile tilapia, {{breeding}} programs focus {{mainly on}} growth, {{and information on}} genetic improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield is scarce. In this study, slaughter data were collected on 1215 tilapia and {{used to analyze the}} relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Fish were obtained from three different origins/strains, and raised in a commercial farm in the Netherlands in closed recirculation systems until a final mean weight of 700 g. Body weight, length, height, width and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length were taken prior to slaughter, and used to predict <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield using linear regression models. Average <b>fillet</b> yield was 35. 7 % with large differences between strains (range 34. 4 - 38 %). There was a strong almost linear relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, but relationships with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. R- 2 of the regression model for <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 95 and the correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight 0. 98. The effect of strain/origin was significant for each body measurement. The effect of sex and strain x sex was significant for length and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length. The <b>fillet</b> yield model explained 15 % of the observed variance; the correlation between observed and predicted <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 38, but there were large differences within strains. We conclude that in Nile tilapia, predicting <b>fillet</b> yield based on body measurements is possible, but correlations can be improved if more accurate methods for measuring body width become available.

40|$|A three {{generation}} {{data set}} consisting of 5, 532 records {{from a long}} term selection program for high growth rate in GIFT was used to derive prediction equations for <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Models were based on body traits (body weight, standard length, body width and body depth) and a carcass measurement (<b>fillet</b> weight). Length, width and depth were adjusted for the systematic effects of generation, selection line, gender, <b>filleting</b> batch, grow-out pond, their first order interactions, and for the covariables age at slaughter and body weight. Body and <b>fillet</b> weights adjusted for the same effects (except body weight) were used to calculate <b>fillet</b> yield. Average <b>fillet</b> weight and yield were 177. 7 g and 33. 6 %, respectively. The simple (Pearson) correlation coefficients between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight were moderate to very high (0. 52 to 0. 94), but the correlations between body traits and <b>fillet</b> yield were very low (- 0. 02 to 0. 14). There were strong linear relationships between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, whereas relationships of body traits with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. Step-wise multiple regression analysis showed that the best model to predict <b>fillet</b> weight included all body traits, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 94 and a correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight of 0. 97. The corresponding figures for <b>fillet</b> yield were 0. 12 and 0. 35, respectively. Body weight was {{the best predictor of}} <b>fillet</b> weight, explaining 93 % of observed variance when it was fitted alone in the model. By contrast, body depth explained a large proportion (97 %) of total variance in the full prediction model for <b>fillet</b> yield. It is concluded that in practical breeding programs, improvement of <b>fillet</b> weight can be easily made through indirect selection for body trait combinations. By contrast, improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield seems much more difficult to achieve by indirect means, with only 12 % of the variation in the trait explained by the body and carcass traits examined in this stud...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{total weight}} {{is the best}} single {{measurement}} for predicting <b>fillet</b> weight in Asian sea bass. Regression models developed {{in this study are}} applicable to fish weighing 960 – 1190  g from all populations sampled. Using separate models yielded similar prediction power and accuracy for <b>fillet</b> weight. This study demonstrates the use of various body measurements in predicting <b>fillet</b> yields. Despite relatively weak correlations between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yields, we were able to develop useful prediction models for <b>fillet</b> yields in three stocks of Asian sea bass. Although <b>fillet</b> yield is the most important trait for fish processors, increased <b>fillet</b> percentages could be achieved along with increased <b>fillet</b> weights, given the positive correlation between the traits. The application of prediction models would allow for rapid genetic improvement via breeding to increase <b>fillet</b> yields and enable producers to be more competitive in the value-added markets of Asian sea bass.|$|R

5|$|Given the {{abundance}} of fresh fish coming it {{at the port of}} Skagen, seafood forms a staple of cuisine in Skagen. Of particular note is the Skagen Fiske Restaurant, one of the most renowned seafood restaurants in Jutland which was established in 1907 {{at the side of the}} harbour. It serves shrimp, herring, grilled <b>fillets</b> of sole with lemon sauce and Norwegian lobster. Ruth's Gourmet in Ruth's Hotel on Hans Ruth Vej is also of note and has been cited to be one of the top five restaurants in Denmark outside of Copenhagen, serving French cuisine under head chef Michel Michaud. Ruths Hotel was originally built by Emma and Hans Christian Ruth in 1904 as a bath and guest house. It was purchased by J. Philip-Sørensen in 2003. The Restaurant Pakhuset, the restaurant of the Brøndums Hotel, and Jakobs Café are also popular; Jakobs Café is a music venue and bar at night.
