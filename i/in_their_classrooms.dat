5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms,</b> while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.|$|E
25|$|Standardized {{tests have}} caused the quality and depth of the {{educational}} curriculum to diminish (Rooks, Noliwe, and Noliwe Rooks). Instead of teachers developing a curriculum that addresses {{the needs of the}} actual students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms,</b> they end up using the required material which they did not take any part in creating. The required material often contains pacing guidelines which regulate when substance should be taught and scripted lessons which often limits the teacher’s abilities to make relevant decisions in a classroom.|$|E

25|$|High school {{students}} in every riding in Ontario were allowed to cast ballots <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms</b> {{as part of a}} student vote. While their numbers did not count in the official election, they did tell a story all on their own. The student vote reflected change a lot more than the actual result, as well as widespread anti-conservatism. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.|$|E
500|$|Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} the first volume, {{have been used}} in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has used Caged Bird and Gather Together in My Name when training teachers to appropriately explore racism <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers of Angelou's autobiographies to wonder what she [...] "left out" [...] and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with [...] "surprise, particularly when [...] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".|$|E

Initially, he directly spoke to deputies in the hallway while holding one of the hostages at gunpoint, but later spoke via telephone and used the student hostages as relayers between the negotiators and himself, as {{he did not want to}} speak directly with officials. After four of the six girls were released between the hours of 12:35 p.m. and 1:45 p.m., negotiators heightened the intensity of their indirect discussions with Morrison. During this time, 16-year-old junior Emily Keyes, one of the two remaining hostages, managed to send her family a brief text message stating, [...] "I love u guys" [...] in response to a text message ("R U OK?") her father, John-Michael Keyes, had sent using his cell phone after receiving word that an incident was occurring at the high school.

2500|$|In an {{educational}} setting, a PLC may include people from multiple {{levels of the}} organization who are collaboratively and continually working together {{for the betterment of}} the organization. Peter Senge believes [...] "it is no longer sufficient to have one person learning for the organization". A major principle of PLCs is that people learn more together than if they were on their own, if conditions are right. Teachers may promote the idea of team learning to students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms,</b> but teachers may not practice team learning in their professional lives; PLCs aim to help teachers practice the team learning that they preach. Senge suggests that when teams learn together there are beneficial results for the organization. Some school improvement evaluators have even claimed that [...] "high-quality collaboration has become no less than an imperative".|$|E

One of those programs was the Lowell Whiteman Primary School in Steamboat Springs, Colorado which implemented a two-year trial program using Transcendental Meditation <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b> The program was used with fifth through eighth graders. After instruction, the TM teachers visit the school once per month to assess the students' progress and their meditation technique. The following year, about 160 students and teachers at Tucson Magnet High School in Tucson AZ, took the training in Transcendental Meditation and meditate daily for 15 minutes before or after school.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{findings of}} a workshop based on responses given by practicing teachers {{on the use of}} Literature Circles (LC) as a technique to develop students’ creative writing skills.

The other issue initiated in this paper is the teachers’ opinion on the suitability and practicality of applying Literature Circles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classroom.</b> The overall response shows that, prior to the workshop session, the teachers have used conventional methods <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classroom.</b> Interestingly, it is discovered that they are very receptive of the idea of using the technique introduced in the workshop despite the challenges they may face <b>in</b> <b>their</b> classes...|$|R

2500|$|Consultation is an {{important}} part of a school psychologist’s career because it allows school psychologists to reach more children than using direct intervention techniques. Consultation is usually thought of as a triadic relationship with the school psychologist working with another individual in hopes of helping change many students behaviors/grades [...] The individual that school psychologists usually work with during consultation is a parent or teacher. School psychologists consult with parents to address learning and behavioral problems at home that can interfere with school progress. More frequently though school psychologists work with teachers during consultation to reach the many students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b> School psychologists mainly consult teachers on developing and implementing classroom management techniques and implementing specific interventions for specific students. School psychologists also now consult with administrators on a systems-level. When working on a systems level, school psychologists generally do not just work with one person but instead works with multiple individuals to make changes and help students on a more broad level. This can be to develop school wide programs to combat bullying or improve the entire school’s reading program.|$|E
