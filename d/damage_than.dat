5|$|Although {{increasing}} {{echelons of}} the scale correspond to stronger winds, the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects. Lower-category storms can inflict greater <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> higher-category storms, depending on factors such as local terrain, population density and total rainfall. For instance, a Category2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> a large Category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly who was {{responsible}} for the damage on the German ships. It is possible that the mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers. Should this be the case, the bombers achieved far more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> the Royal Navy {{and the rest of the}} RAF combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Dubourdieu sent {{a report}} to the Minister of War describing the French losses. Henri IV took several hits, with 1 dead and 9 wounded. The Sané suffered more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> the Gomer, but neither was seriously damaged. Three men were killed on the Sané, and nine were wounded.|$|E
30|$|Assortative {{nature of}} both the product’s and the supplier’s network means that hubs tend to connect to hubs, making cascades of {{disruptions}} more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> that of disassortative networks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't scare mother, I 'm all right. Got upset, did n't I?" [...] he asked, presently, {{eyeing the}} {{prostrate}} velocipede with more anxiety about its <b>damages</b> <b>than</b> his own.|$|R
50|$|Lott {{makes an}} {{argument}} that reputations are an important, and often overlooked, asset in the economy. He gives examples of how hurt reputations can be more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> penalties imposed by law.|$|R
5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on {{the front}} line of the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown's military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition.|$|E
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the passage of Igor, a weather buoy from St. John's was spotted near the Shetland Islands north of Scotland on September12, 2011. In early October, Newfoundland was again struck by a {{tropical}} cyclone– Hurricane Ophelia. Though a weaker storm, Ophelia caused more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of Igor. The mayor of Marystown criticized government officials for not increasing the size of repairs, especially to culverts, to account for flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} a tension gauge, {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> regular moves. A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E
25|$|Gunshot wounds, {{which are}} higher energy than stab wounds, are usually more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> the latter. Gunshot wounds that {{penetrate}} the peritoneum result in significant damage to major intra-abdominal structures in some 90 percent of cases.|$|R
5000|$|On several {{occasions}} Dawkins made {{the claim that}} sexually abusing a child is [...] "arguably less" [...] <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> [...] "the long term psychological damage inflicted by bringing up a child Catholic in the first place".|$|R
5000|$|Where a financially wealthy {{party can}} be joined as a defendant, a {{plaintiff}} {{has a greater}} chance of recovering <b>damages</b> <b>than</b> when the defendants have very limited economic resources or are financially insolvent, or [...] "judgment proof".|$|R
5|$|The hurricane's intense winds, waves, {{rains and}} storm surge were {{responsible}} for at least 45deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.66billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean devastated agricultural crops, particularly those of Martinique and Jamaica. Upon reaching Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category5 storm, but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category2 storm.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} neared land, a ridge over Mexico {{prevented}} Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> forecast. As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuatán and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship. Only twopeople survived; fifteenbodies were recovered, and ninepassengers were never found.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E
5000|$|In 1941, Cohen married Lona Cohen, Communist Party USA {{activist and}} courier for Manhattan Project {{physicist}} Theodore Hall (part of {{a ring of}} atomic spies revealed later to have been far more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> the well-known Rosenberg ring).|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} be more {{unsteady}} than the waves, Quin; and as to wobbling, {{that would be an}} advantage, for a rigid raft in a rough sea would be more liable to be <b>damaged</b> <b>than</b> one that was pliable." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{both eyes}} are {{affected}} by PION, the pupils may look symmetrical. However, if the eyes are asymmetrically affected, i.e. one eye's optic nerve is more <b>damaged</b> <b>than</b> the other, it will produce an important sign called an afferent pupillary defect.|$|R
5|$|In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg {{demonstrated}} {{with ten}} civic leaders {{in front of}} the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the slow progress of construction on the NY102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up for miles near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY24) exit, and evidence showed no work had been done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that a project that began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale project that required a redesign {{due to the fact that}} the bridge had more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> initially realized.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts did more <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize his music by word of mouth.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E
50|$|The Court hears de novo appeals {{from the}} District Court. When hearing appeals Circuit Court judges {{have the same}} powers as a District Court judge and so cannot give higher {{sentences}} or award more <b>damages</b> <b>than</b> a District Court judge could do.|$|R
25|$|Reports of {{the leak}} caused {{thousands}} of cancellations at resorts and hotels along the Sea of Japan coast, even {{as far as}} Murakami, Niigata (140km northeast) and Sado Island. Inn owners have said that rumors have been more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> direct effects of the earthquake.|$|R
50|$|Past {{temperature}} {{records for}} Britain suggest that seedlots run {{a high risk}} of suffering severe frost damage in all but mild coastal regions, and that spring and autumn frosts may be more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> winter frosts.The Lophozonia alpine's leaves grow down towards the ground.|$|R
5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The {{entrance}} hall was completely burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from the militants trying to set the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The {{director general of the}} Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies seem to indicate that there were foreigners among the dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} H. pylori {{a person is}} exposed to may {{influence}} {{the risk of developing}} gastric cancer. Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Lidia was a deadly, {{destructive}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{that occurred during}} the 1981 Pacific hurricane season. It resulted in more casualties and caused greater <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> Hurricane Norma, which took place later that season. On October 6, a tropical depression formed and strengthened into a tropical storm six hours later. Lidia brushed the Gulf of California coast of Baja California Sur and made landfall just south of Los Mochis in Sinaloa on October 8. Tropical Storm Lidia rapidly weakened and dissipated the same day. Lidia killed at least 73 people and caused at least $80 million (1981 USD) which is equivalent to $193 million (2010 USD) in damage. It inflicted heavy rain and flooding throughout parts of northwestern Mexico, especially Sinaloa.|$|E
50|$|Certain regions {{within the}} United States are more {{susceptible}} to droughts than others. Droughts can be more <b>damaging</b> <b>than</b> tornadoes, tropical cyclones, winter storms and flooding combined. Unlike a hurricane, tornado or flooding, the onset of droughts happen gradually {{over a long period of}} time.|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{germination}} has been {{detected in the}} presence or {{in the absence of}} Actinomycin D (AmD) in fresh and stored binucleate pollen grains of' Golden Delicious' (GD) and' Starkrimson' (S). Pollen tube growth consisted of two distinct phases, autotrophic and heterotrophic, in both fresh and stored pollen grains. The pollens of the two cultivars differ: (i) in the length of the first phase, being 3 h in GD and 2 h in S, and (ii) in the response to storage. As far as the response to storage is concerned the cultivar S seems to be more <b>damaged</b> <b>than</b> GD when the storage effect is evaluated as the first phase length; less <b>damaged</b> <b>than</b> GD when the effect is expressed as tube length...|$|R

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|It {{became known}} on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had {{destroyed}} {{three of the}} best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of Elahbel. On 5 October 2015, news media reported ISIL is destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including the Arch of Triumph. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that the militants destroyed the tetrapylon {{and part of the}} theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was less serious in relativity.|$|E
5|$|Post-storm {{analysis}} showed that, while less deadly, Dean's first {{and more powerful}} landfall caused significantly more infrastructural <b>damage</b> <b>than</b> its second. Where the landfall occurred at the town of Majahual specifically, {{and the state of}} Quintana Roo generally, communities took longer to recover than {{in the rest of the}} country. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities and secured Mex$755million (US$74.8million) of aid. Combined with the state's contribution of $270million (US$26.7million), a housing-repair fund of over $1,025million (US$101.5million) was established. In the three months immediately following the storm, over 37,000houses were rebuilt or repaired using monies from this fund.|$|E
5000|$|In Bridge, {{the penalty}} for a revoke is {{normally}} one or two tricks scored against the offending partnership, depending on the exact circumstances, but if the non-offending side is more seriously <b>damaged</b> <b>than</b> that (typically because the revoke made a critical entry worthless), then they are compensated accordingly.|$|R
