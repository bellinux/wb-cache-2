50|$|SCODA (synchronous {{coefficient}} of drag alteration) is a broad biotechnology method for purifying, separating and/or concentrating bio-molecules. SCODA {{has the ability to}} separate molecules whose mobility (or drag) can be altered in sync with a driving field. This technique has been primarily used for concentrating and purifying DNA, where DNA mobility changes with an applied <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field.</b> Electrophoretic SCODA has also been demonstrated with RNA and proteins.|$|E
5000|$|To perform SCODA {{concentration}} of DNA molecules the sample must be {{embedded in the}} separation media (gel) in locations where the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field</b> is of optimal intensity. This initial translocation of the sample into the optimal concentration position {{is referred to as}} [...] "injection". The optimal position is determined by the gel geometry and location of the SCODA driving electrodes. Initially the sample is located in a buffer solution in the sample chamber, adjacent to the concentration gel. Injection is achieved by the application of a controlled DC <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field</b> across the sample chamber which results in all charged particles being transferred into the concentration gel. To obtain a good stacking of the sample (i.e. tight DNA band) multiple methods can be employed. One example is to exploit the conductivity ratio between the sample chamber buffer and the concentration gel buffer. If the sample chamber buffer has a low conductivity and the concentration gel buffer has a high conductivity this results in a sharp drop off in electric field at the gel-buffer interface which promotes stacking.|$|E

Such drift can only occur for molecules, such as DNA, whose motive response to <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>fields</b> is nonlinear.

40|$|SUMMARY Lymphocytes of {{patients}} suffering from Duchenne {{and other types}} of muscular dystrophyand the Kugelberg-Welandersyndrome showed marked sensitization to muscle and also to central and peripheral nervous antigens even in preclinical disease. These findings are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of the disease. Muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder in which progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle occurs. This is generally considered to be due to some pri-mary biochemical genetically determined defect in muscle fibres themselves. The motor innervation of dystrophic muscle {{has been the subject of}} much recent work including that of McComas and colleagues (McComas, Sica, and Currie, 1970; Campbell, McComas, and Sica, 1970; McComas and Sica, 1970).

40|$|The {{ability to}} process damaged DNA may vary between cells {{depending}} on their differentiated status. However, there is little in vivo data available {{and it is not}} intuitively obvious how the activity of specific repair pathways may vary between different subpopulations (e. g. stem cells and proliferative, committed and differentiated cells) of a particular tissue. To obtain such information for the intestinal epithelium, we have developed an assay that detects differences in the way different regions of the crypt (stem, proliferative and maturation zones) respond to DNA damage. The assay is a variant of the 'comet' assay, which detects DNA strand breaks by measuring the proportion of DNA migrating from individual cells, or in this case intact isolated crypts, in an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field.</b> The method is quantitative, with the amount of migrating DNA being proportional to the number of strand breaks. Isolated crypts are repair competent and spatial differences are apparent with some agents. The assay has the potential to characterize the repair properties of cells at different stages of differentiation within the crypt, determine the characteristics that might predispose them to damage and may help in understanding the route of stem cell mutation...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{research}} has indicated that the two sperm cells of Nicotiana tabacum are dimorphic, suggesting that they may participate in preferential fertilization during in vivo fusion with the egg and central cells. To probe the mechanism of potential preferential fertilization in this plant, {{it will be necessary to}} use modern sensitive molecular techniques. For this purpose, two individual populations of two sperm cells, constituting the Svn (associated with the vegetative nucleus) and Sua (unassociated with the vegetative nucleus), were isolated in the thousands from tobacco pollen tubes with a micromanipulator as a preliminary step toward research on gametic recognition using molecular techniques. Microelectrophoresis of paired sperm cells from a single pollen tube was conducted at different developmental stages. Sperm cells isolated from 1 -, 2 -, 3 - and 4 -cm stylar lengths migrated to the negative pole, with the Sua displaying significantly greater electrophoretic mobility than the Svn, reflecting a more positively charged cell surface on the Sua. The sperm cells isolated from 1 -cm style are very sensitive to electron potential in an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field,</b> presumably reflecting that they are still in a young state.

By means of fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, removal of nucleic acids with protamine sulfate, adsorption on calcium phosphate gel, and pH gradient chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, the catalase “activity” was purified approximately 14 -fold. The purified enzyme preparation was insensitive to the heme poisons cyanide and azide, the metal chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetate and o-phenanthroline, and the sulfhydryl binding agent p-chloromercuribenzoate. The purified enzyme moved at a uniform rate in the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field</b> (isoelectric point, pH 4. 7). The ultraviolet-light absorption spectrum was negative for heme-iron components, and fluorescence measurements yielded negative results with regard to flavin components.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{kinematic}} analysis and {{experimental study of}} DNA deformation in electric field gradients. Specifically, we investigate deformation near a large insulating cylinder with single molecule fluorescence videomicroscopy. Because the <b>electrophoretic</b> velocity <b>field</b> is a potential field, a kinematic analysis shows that local deformation of DNA in any electric field gradient is pure elongation, quantified by a strain rate and orthogonal axes of extension and compression. From the kinematics, we construct the electrophoretic Deborah number relating the competing effects of deformation {{in the field and}} the polymer elasticity. We report highly configuration-sensitive stretching {{at the front of the}} obstacle and affine compression in the region near the back stagnation point. Furthermore, the DNA also can extend both “pre-impact ” and “post-impact ” in this inhomogeneous extensional field.

40|$|During {{the course}} of studies on the {{reaction}} of "immunologically unrespon. sire " rabbits to crude staphylococcal toxin (1) we {{became interested in the}} various reported activities of alpha hemolysin. It became important for us to know whether we were dealing with one, or more than one antigen, when we measured the alpha hemolytic, dermonecrotic, and lethal activities of crude toxin. Several workers (2 - 10) have presented evidence which supports the "unitarian theory, " namely, that the alpha hemolytic, dermonecrotic, and lethal properties of crude staphylococcal toxin represent different activities of one toxin. Contrariwise, an equally large group (11 - 23) have contended that these three activities do not reside in one toxin. It should be noted, however, that in most cases the evidence found pertaining to the "unitarian theory " was extracted from work which did not have as its principal objective the solution of this problem. Another toxic effect of crude staphylococcal toxin, namely, its effect on rabbit leucocytes, has been described by Neisser and Wechsberg (24). Some workers (25 - 27) consider this effect to be a fourth activity of alpha hemolysin, while others (13, 19, 28) feel that this leucocidal effect is an expression of a toxin distinct from the alpha hemolysin.

40|$|Poster presentationsCandida glabrata {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} in compromised {{patient populations}} due to its increased resistance to fluconazole (FL). Although the increase in fluconazole resistance is associated with changes in its genotype no parallel phenotypic or proteomic changes have been studied. OBJECTIVES: To observe specific phenotypic, chromosomal and proteomic alterations in a C. glabrata strain sequentially exposed to fluconazole. METHODS: C. glabrata was subjected to serial exposure of minimum concentrations (×MICs) of fluconazole in RPMI medium {{for a period of}} 55 days. Phenotypic changes (i. e., resistance to azole drugs, adhesion to BECs, phospholipase, haemolysin production, phenotypic switching) were evaluated at different time points using standard assays. The development of molecular/ proteomic changes in C. glabrata were analyzed by contour-clamped-homogeneous <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>field</b> (CHEF) electrophoresis, RT-PCR, 2 -DE gel based methodology and mass spectrometric peptide finger print analysis of SDS-PAGE yeast separated protein fractions. RESULTS: C. glabrata demonstrated increased FL resistance (8 -> 256 µg/ml) accompanied with extensive cross-resistance to ketoconazole (0. 38 - 3. 0 µg), itraconazole (8 -> 32 µg) and voriconazole (0. 125 - 1. 5 µg). Variable colony morphology (size), a decrease in viable yeast counts, and inconsistent phenotypic switching on CuSO 4 agar was observed. Further, seven randomly selected morphologically dissimilar yeast colonies also demonstrated pronounced differences in their chromosomal profiles compared with the control isolate. Stable changes in the chromosomal profiles of two yeast colonies were associated with significantly (p< 0. 05) higher transcript levels of the haemolysin gene relative to the control. Proteome analysis of one stable colony resulted in a total of 98 spots with 25 upregulated and 24 downregulated proteins. CONCLUSION: These findings show that sequential fluconazole exposure initiates the chance evolution of a new colonizing population with specific virulence traits.
