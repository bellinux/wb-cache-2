The microorganisms found in animal digestive tracts where oxygen is deficient, generally produce enzymes assemblies, acting synergistically, such as cellulosomes. Such structures remain associated to the microorganism membrane. Many insects feed on plant material and benefit for the degradation of lignocellulose of an endosymbiosis with bacterial population located in their digestive tracts. The study of original strategies implemented in insect guts would be of interest for possible improvements of the biomass conversion in industrial processes.

Virtually no prior knowledge of the products and reactants is assumed. S-systems are a power law formalism for the canonical approximate representation of dynamic non-linear systems. This formalism has the useful property that the structure of a network is dictated only by the values of the power law parameters. This means that network inference problems (e. g. inference of the topology of a chemical reaction network) can be recast as parameter estimation problems. The use of S-systems for network inference from data has been reported in a number of biological fields, including metabolic pathway analysis and the inference of gene regulatory networks.

40|$|Introduction: Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has become}} a popular host for {{production}} of non-native compounds. The metabolic pathways involved generally require a net input of energy. To maximize the ATP yield on sugar in S. cerevisiae, industrial cultivation is typically performed in aerobic, sugar-limited <b>fed-batch</b> <b>reactors</b> which, due to constraints in oxygen transfer and cooling capacities, have to be operated at low specific growth rates. Because intracellular levels of key metabolites are growth-rate dependent, slow growth can significantly affect biomass-specific productivity. Using an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain expressing a heterologous pathway for resveratrol production as a model energy-requiring product, the impact of specific growth rate on yeast physiology and productivity was investigated in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures. Results: Stoichiometric analysis revealed that de novo resveratrol production from glucose requires 13 moles of ATP per mole of produced resveratrol. The biomass-specific production rate of resveratrol showed a strong positive correlation with the specific growth rate. At low growth rates a substantial fraction of the carbon source was invested in cellular maintenance-energy requirements (e. g. 27 % at 0. 03 h? 1). This distribution of resources was unaffected by resveratrol production. Formation of the by-products coumaric, phloretic and cinnamic acid had no detectable effect on maintenance energy requirement and yeast physiology in chemostat. Expression of the heterologous pathway led to marked differences in transcript levels in the resveratrol-producing strain, including increased expression levels of genes involved in pathways for precursor supply (e. g. ARO 7 and ARO 9 involved in phenylalanine biosynthesis). The observed strong differential expression of many glucose-responsive genes in the resveratrol producer as compared to a congenic reference strain could be explained from higher residual glucose concentrations and higher relative growth rates in cultures of the resveratrol producer. Conclusions: De novo resveratrol production by engineered S. cerevisiae is an energy demanding process. Resveratrol production by an engineered strain exhibited a strong correlation with specific growth rate. Since industrial production in <b>fed-batch</b> <b>reactors</b> typically involves low specific growth rates, this study emphasizes the need for uncoupling growth and product formation via energy-requiring pathways.

However, independently of their robustness, both the parental and the Δyca 1 mutant ceased to grow early during fed-batch runs, both strains using most of the available carbon source for maintenance, rather than for further proliferation. The mathematical model used evidenced that the energy demand for maintenance was even higher in the case of the Δyca 1 mutant, accounting for the growth arrest observed despite the fact that cell viability remained comparatively high.

40|$|Monitoring the {{limiting}} reactant concentration {{is a key}} question to maximize the productivity and to guarantee the safety of exothermic fed-batch processes. However in most applications, the concentration cannot be measured in real-time since suitable devices do not exist or are too expensive; the concentrations are then measured by off-line analyses. In this context monitoring the concentrations via software sensors, or state observer based estimators, is an attractive option. The presence of model uncertainties is a major limitation when applying state observers to real processes. More precisely, in <b>fed-batch</b> exothermic <b>reactors</b> the bad knowledge of both the reaction kinetics and the heat transfer may prevent the use of classical observers. In this study, we propose two different approaches to estimate the concentration of {{the limiting}} reactant {{in a class of}} single phase exothermic <b>fed-batch</b> <b>reactors</b> with uncertain kinetics and heat transfer. The first approach is based on a finite time converging observer that provides an estimate for the reaction rate via the reactor energy balance equation. The concentration is then computed from the reaction rate estimate via a material balance equation. The main contribution of this approach is the use of a finite time observer to limit the reconstruction error by guaranteeing a small convergence time interval for the reaction rate estimate. The second approach is based on an interval observer that provides two bounds for the concentration by considering uncertainties related to both the heat transfer and the reaction kinetics. The final estimate is then computed as the mean of the bounds. A systematic tuning procedure has been developed for each of both estimation techniques. Both estimators have then been tested and validated with real data coming from the production of different kinds of resins carried out in 10 tons reactors. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

We observed a well-defined relationship between the rate of sulfate reduction and the number of dsr mRNA transcripts per cell. Cells from reactors maintained with the highest rate of sulfate reduction contain 315 times more dsr mRNA per cell than those in reactors with the lowest reduction rate. These results suggest {{we might be able to}} infer rates of sulfate reduction in the field by measuring the amount of dsr mRNA per cell in biomass samples. Such estimates are difficult to make directly because the rate at bacteria consume reactants and generate products cannot be observed readily in many environments, such as aquifers open to groundwater flow...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the changes observed in granule characteristics of sludge in the treatment of synthetic wastewater at a concentration of about 500 mgCOD/L in batch, fed-batch (ASBR) and continuous (UASB) bench-scale reactors under similar experimental conditions. Physical and microbiological properties of the granules were characterized as average particle size and sedimentation time and by optical and epifluorescence microscopy. Several samples were analyzed in order to identify the morphologies. Granules from sequencing batch and <b>fed-batch</b> <b>reactors,</b> either with or without mechanical mixing, did not undergo any physical or microbiological changes. However, during the experiment granules from the UASB reactor agglomerated due to the formation and accumulation of a viscous material, probably of microbial origin, when operated at low superficial velocities (0. 072, 0. 10 and 0. 19 m/h). When the superficial velocity was increased to 8. 0 - 10. 0 m/h by means of liquid-phase recirculation, the granules from the UASB reactor underwent flocculation and the microbiological characteristics changed {{in such a way that}} the equilibrium of microbial diversity in the inoculum was not maintained. As a result, the only reactor that maintained efficiency and good solids retention during the assays was the ASBR, showing that there is a correlation between maintenance of microbial diversity and operating mode in the case of anaerobic treatment of low-strength wastewaters...|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{production}} from waste lipids is a promising technology for sustainable energy production. In anaerobic bioreactors, lipids and long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are easily {{removed from the}} liquid medium, mainly by adsorption. However, further LCFA degradation is rate-limiting and possible dependent {{on the development of}} syntrophic communities. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes was used to follow the changes in bacterial communities during continuous and <b>fed-batch</b> <b>reactors</b> operation with oleate, an unsaturated LCFA. A specific dominant DGGE-band corresponding to bacteria deeply clustering with Syntrophomonas zehnderi (99 % identity) was found in all the sludges that could degrade oleate, thus suggesting the involvement of this bacterium in unsaturated LCFA catabolism. Therefore, the potential of S. zehnderi as bioaugmenting strain for improving methane {{production from}} oleate was further studied in batch assays. Oleate was added to the medium at a final concentration of 1 mM and the assays were performed with and without the solid microcarrier sepiolite. Methane production was faster in the bioaugmented assays, and this effect was more pronounced in the presence of sepiolite. The positive effects of sepiolite can be related to a decrease in oleate toxicity towards the acetoclastic methanogens, or to an improvement of the syntrophic relationships. Bioaugmentation with S. zehnderi might be a suitable strategy for accelerating LCFA conversion to methane in anaerobic bioreactors, shortening the start-up period of high rate continuous processes or recover LCFA-inhibited sludge...|$|R
