5|$|Steinholt <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> small {{municipalities}} {{should be}} merged {{because of their}} economic problems. She feels the government focus on the struggling economy of the municipalities should be towards cleaning up their debt. In 2008 alone, the municipalities of Norway had a gathered debt of NOK 20.7 billion. She stated that if Red was elected to parliament, they would propose a bill giving the municipalities an immediate transfer of NOK 10 billion.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5000|$|It is not {{absurd to}} assert the second- or third-person {{counterparts}} to Moore's sentences, e.g. [...] "It is raining, but you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is raining," [...] or [...] "Michael is dead, but they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he is." ...|$|R
5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing." [...] Augustine: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Christ; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Son of God; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Word of the Father; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the author of the world; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if Moses could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it? In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exodus 3, 13-15)(Augustine on the Gospel of St. John) (Gilson, p. 85) ...|$|R

[...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in nature, just as I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in Odin. She is a myth. It is not merely <b>that</b> I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nature can guide us. It is <b>that</b> I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nature exists." ...|$|R
5|$|Later, Jack asks Liz {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the relationship is serious since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all the rooms of the hotel that Liz and Carol stay in when he is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol bursts into tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{he is a good}} actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>That</b> night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

I am very largely in your hands over the Tapilow affair, and, as you know, I have seen {{too much of the}} world to consider trifles. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Delora came to London to sell his crop of coffee. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are ignorant of his affairs.

5000|$|According to Iōannēs Polemēs, the {{important}} Orthodox theologian Gregory Palamas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sinners would experience the divine light: [...] "Unlike Theophanes, Palamas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sinners {{could have an}} experience of the divine light ... Nowhere in his works does Palamas seem to adopt Theophanes' view that the light of Tabor is identical with the fire of hell." ...|$|R
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in Holby City in minor roles. Mealing appeared {{as the mother of}} a paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared as the son of a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would work against him.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

Inside, Dean locates Bobby, who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he is dreaming. A woman with stab wounds approaches them, and Bobby reveals that she is his wife.

25|$|Anarcho-capitalism advocates the {{elimination}} of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory. There is a strong current within anarchism which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> anarcho-capitalism can be considered {{to be a part of}} the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalism.|$|E
25|$|However, she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Islam is {{the root}} cause of gender {{inequality}} in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. She points at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as mothers and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.|$|E
