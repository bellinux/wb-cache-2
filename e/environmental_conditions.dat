5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
40|$|Our {{systematic}} {{formulation of}} nonlinear population models {{is based on}} the notion of the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition.</b> The defining property of the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> is that individuals are independent of one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed (in principle as an arbitrary function of time, but when focussing on steady states we shall restrict to constant functions). The steady-state problem has two components: (i) the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> should be such that the existing populations do neither grow nor decline; (ii) a feedback consistency <b>condition</b> relating the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> to the community/population size and composition should hold. In this paper we develop, justify and analyse basic formalism under the assumption that individuals can be born in only finitely many possible states and that the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> is fully characterized by finitely many numbers. The theory is illustrated by many examples. In addition to various simple toy models introduced for explanation purposes, these include a detailed elaboration of a cannibalism model and a general treatment of how genetic and physiological structure should be combined in a single model...|$|R

5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> are favorable.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool.

These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E

40|$|The species {{composition}} of fish communities in 15 microtidal estuaries in south-western Australia, ranging from permanently-open to normally-closed, {{is shown to}} be related to the geomorphological and hydrological regimes and not to <b>environmental</b> <b>condition.</b> This study then explored the effectiveness of using qualitative taxonomic distinctness and ABC curves for fish data as indicators of the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> in nearshore, shallow waters of these estuaries and, in the case of taxonomic distinctness, also of their offshore, deeper waters. Neither of these indices require spatial or temporal reference data, which may be either prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to collect or unavailable. Taxonomic distinctness, in both nearshore and offshore waters, varied consistently among estuaries in relation to their recorded environmental status, and is thus a good indicator of overall estuarine condition. ABC analyses, however, did not prove a good measure of the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> of the estuaries, because their results largely reflect differences in accessibility of the estuary to marine estuarine-opportunist species and especially those that grow to a larger size. It is concluded that taxonomic distinctness indices provide a rapid and cost-effective method for assessing the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> of estuaries, particularly those with limited spatial or temporal reference data...|$|R
