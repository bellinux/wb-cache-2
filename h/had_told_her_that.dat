Ball later {{said in an}} interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having to guess which celebrity a letter was for.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Gough gave {{evidence}} {{on the third day}} of the trial. She testified that she had married her husband in February 1942, having left the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) in June 1941. They had no children of their own. She corroborated some of Terence's testimony about her husband's treatment of Dennis, and said she was afraid of her husband and that she believed that had she originally told the truth to the police she would also be dead. Her husband <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Dennis was dead and instructed her to lie to the doctor.|$|E

In {{addition}} to the departure of Pam Ewing, Donna Culver Krebbs and Ray Krebbs divorced {{at the end of}} season ten, and Donna moved to Washington, D.C. where she married Senator Andrew Dowling (guest star Jim McMullan), with whom she raised Ray's daughter Margaret. Actress Susan Howard stated in 1987 that the producers <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her character had run its course. A year later Ray sold his ranch to Carter McKay and left Dallas with his new wife Jenna Wade and Jenna's children Charlie and Lucas (the latter fathered by Bobby), bound for Switzerland.

25|$|In 1854, {{a disease}} {{spread through the}} cattle of the Xhosa. It was {{believed}} to have spread from cattle owned by the Settlers. Widespread cattle deaths resulted, and the Xhosa believed that the deaths were caused by ubuthi, or witchcraft. In April, 1856 two girls, one named Nongqawuse, went to scare birds out of the fields. When she returned, she told her uncle Mhlakaza that she had met three spirits at the bushes, and that they <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> all cattle should be slaughtered, and their crops destroyed. On the day following the destruction, the dead Xhosa would return and help expel the whites. The ancestors would bring cattle with them to replace those that had been killed. Mhlakaza believed the prophecy, and repeated it to the chief Sarhili.|$|E
25|$|Welles {{is thought}} to have had a son, British {{director}} Michael Lindsay-Hogg (born May 5, 1940), with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. When Lindsay-Hogg was 16 his mother reluctantly divulged that there were pervasive rumors that his father was Welles, and she denied them—but in such detail that he doubted her veracity. Fitzgerald evaded the subject {{for the rest of her}} life. Lindsay-Hogg knew Welles, worked with him in the theatre and met him at intervals throughout Welles's life. After he learned that Welles's oldest daughter Chris, his childhood playmate, had long suspected that he was her brother, Lindsay-Hogg initiated a DNA test that proved inconclusive. In his 2011 autobiography Lindsay-Hogg reported that his questions were resolved by his mother's close friend Gloria Vanderbilt, who wrote that Fitzgerald <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Welles was his father. A 2015 Welles biography by Patrick McGilligan, however, reports the impossibility of Welles's paternity: Fitzgerald left the U.S. for Ireland in May 1939 and her son was conceived before her return in late October, while Welles did not travel overseas during that period.|$|E

500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called to the witness box. She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what she had said in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|On September 19, Dannemann {{spoke with}} a {{journalist}} for the German tabloid Bild. During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to sleep for {{a day and a half}} before he went to America. She told me that he did not intend to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The John Brownlee {{sex scandal}} {{occurred}} in 1934 in Alberta, Canada, {{and forced the}} resignation of the provincial Premier, [...] John Edward Brownlee. Brownlee was accused of seducing Vivian MacMillan, a family friend and a secretary for Brownlee's attorney-general in 1930, when she was 18 years old, and continuing the affair for three years. [...] MacMillan claimed that the married premier <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she must have sex with him for his own sake and that of his invalid wife. [...] She had, she testified, relented after physical and emotional pressure. [...] Brownlee called her story a fabrication, and suggested that it {{was the result of a}} conspiracy by MacMillan, her would-be fiancé, and several of Brownlee's political opponents in the Alberta Liberal Party.|$|E

500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge {{said that she was}} [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve I think more than any of us will ever know." ...|$|E
500|$|Martello never {{produced}} any {{proof to}} support his claims, {{and there is no}} independent evidence that corroborate them. An anonymous woman who had known Martello informed the researcher Michael G. Lloyd that during the 1980s, he <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he had never been initiated into a tradition of Witchcraft, and that he had simply embraced occultism in the 1960s in order to earn a living. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed criticism of Martello's claims, noting that it was [...] "extremely doubtful" [...] that a tradition of Wicca could have been passed down through Martello's Sicilian family. Instead, he suggested that Martello might have been instructed in a tradition of folk magic that he later embellished into a form of Wicca, that the cousins themselves had constructed a form of Wicca that they passed on to Martello, or that the entire scenario had been a fabrication of Martello's.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 1933, Liberal lawyer Neil MacLean filed a {{statement}} of claim on behalf of Vivian MacMillan and her father Allan MacMillan, suing Brownlee for the seduction of Vivian. [...] It alleged that Brownlee had lured her to Edmonton {{from her home in}} Edson in 1930 with the promise of a job in the provincial attorney-general's office. [...] Upon her arrival, she had become a close friend of the family's. [...] One night Brownlee <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> because of his wife Florence's ill health, they were unable to have a sexual relationship, and that MacMillan must yield to him to prevent him from resuming a sexual relationship with Florence that would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan had eventually yielded, and the ensuing affair lasted until July 1933. [...] Brownlee denied MacMillan's story completely and counter-sued MacMillan and her fiance, John Caldwell, for conspiracy.|$|E

500|$|The {{landlord}} of The Plumbers Arms {{described how}} Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered [...] "head to toe in blood" [...] before {{she fell into}} [...] "a state of shock". He claimed that she shouted [...] "Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered" [...] and [...] "My children, my children, he's murdered my nanny". Pathologist Keith Simpson outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by [...] "blunt head injuries" [...] and [...] "inhalation of blood". He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett's injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought {{more likely to have}} been caused by punches from a clenched fist. The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked [...] "dishevelled", and his hair [...] "a little ruffled". His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was [...] "very hysterical" [...] and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} Sam Houston's death, Baylor University {{president}} William Carey Crane {{was commissioned by}} Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to all correspondence and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had {{little more than a}} passing acquaintance with [...] "the hero of San Jacinto". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's [...] "guardian angel", as he called her, had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L. Haley, [...] "...Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret, that he had no more war to fight within himself, left him with more energy to wage political battle." [...] Ultimately, several of Houston's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor, but not everyone was inspired to join the effort. According to daughter Maggie, the author <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest. Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas was rejected by the initial publisher, but was eventually published by J. B. Lippincott in 1884.|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
