40|$|The {{appearance}} of the contemporary suburb {{is one of its}} most criticized and problematic features. Architects find themselves challenged by its increasing size and complicated planning issues. These challenges are compounded because traditional methods of control do not specifically confront these issues. A less comprehensive method of control, <b>design</b> <b>codes,</b> has recently emerged to address some of the limitations associated with traditional forms of control. This thesis is a survey of five <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> used in contemporary suburbs. Specific focus is given to examining the organization and objectives of <b>design</b> <b>codes,</b> and what architectural elements are regulated. The survey suggests that the most noticeable features of <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> is that they are specific to a project and site, address unique objectives of a particular community, and specifically address suburban design problems. This underlines the essential role <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> have in reshaping and ultimately improving the diminished {{appearance of}} the contemporary suburb...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{applicability of}} expert systems to <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> and <b>design</b> rules. <b>Design</b> <b>codes</b> and <b>design</b> rules contain knowledge {{based on experience}} of accepted practice. <b>Design</b> <b>codes</b> differ from <b>design</b> rules in that their knowledge is written down and available for perusal thus simplifying the knowledge acquisition process. However this knowledge is ill-structured and difficult to use {{for all but the}} experts. The paper demonstrates how the expert system shell BUILD may be used to construct expert systems for <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> and rules. Prototypical systems are shown for the Australian Model Uniform Building Code and for use in the preliminary design of kitchens. The examples show how the same knowledge may be used not only in an analysis mode but also in a design synthesis mod...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} the <b>design</b> <b>codes,</b> good <b>design</b> and the prevention of field failures. There are many <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> for the fatigue design of welds. They contain many differences influenced by the history of particular industries. Engineering may not be well served by these codes since on one hand they are normally conservative, thus creating excessively heavy structures. On the other hand the <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> often do not include the most important factors in the life expectancy of a weld namely the weld procedure, the quality of the weld and environmental effects. The paper concludes that a thorough review and unification of the industry <b>design</b> <b>codes</b> is overdue. The issue of manufacture of welds has to be put at the centre of the consideration of fatigue design...|$|R
2500|$|In North America, a {{more pragmatic}} {{approach}} has been adopted and research into compressive membrane action has primarily stemmed {{from the work of}} Hewitt and Batchelor and Batchelor and Tissington in the 1970s. [...] They carried out an extensive series of field tests, which led to the introduction of an empirical method of design into the Ontario Highway Bridge <b>Design</b> <b>Code</b> in 1979. [...] This required minimum isotropic reinforcement (0.3%) in bridge deck slabs, provided certain boundary conditions were satisfied. [...] In the 1990s Mufti et al. extended this research and showed that significant enhancements in the durability of laterally restrained slabs can be achieved by utilising fibre reinforced deck slabs without steel reinforcement. [...] Later, Mufti and Newhook adapted Hewitt and Batchelor’s model [...] to develop a method for evaluating the ultimate capacity of fibre reinforced deck slabs using external steel straps for the provision of lateral restraint.|$|E
