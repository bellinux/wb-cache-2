The reduction of this pollutant emission results from the complete mixing of fuel and air during the combustion process.

Centrifugal {{machines}} {{are widely used}} in all most all industries for variety of purposes ranging from manufacture of household items to the turbo pumps of space vehicles. This wide spectrum of use of these machines {{has given rise to}} spatial restriction in their working environment, which causes non-uniform flow at the entry of their rotors. This non-uniformity is called inlet distortion and it usually degrades the performance of these machines. This paper presents the results of an investigation carried out to experimentally determine the performance of a <b>radial</b> <b>blower</b> with three types of inlet ducts. Attempts has been made to use different methods for the evaluation of the inlet distortion caused by different shapes and the orientation of the inlet ducts and observe its degenerating effects on the performance of the <b>radial</b> <b>blower.</b> Performance in terms of stable operating ranges of the blower and impeller, and pressure rise coefficients for the blower, impeller and the volute, have been evaluated. It has been found that both the stable operating range and the pressure rise coefficient depend on inlet distortion. It has been found out that both these performance parameters decrease with the increase in the inlet distortion. Further it has been found out that both the shape and orientation cause different magnitudes of inlet distortion and hence decrease the performance parameters of the blower to different magnitudes.

S.) : Bilkent University, Materials Science and Nanotechnology Program, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2016. Optical fibers {{have been widely}} used in the past several decades due to their characteristics, such as laser energy transmission, low optical loss and different beam shape. These features make them advantegous for different applications in a number of fields such as telecommunication, imaging, laser cavity systems and medical applications. Fiber optic probes were developed to use optical fiber systems in medicine since they are exible, small in diameter, easy to use and they transmit the laser energy through the target tissue of the body without any additional optical alignment. The tip geometry of the fiber optic probes can be changed so that the laser radiation is emitted with different shapes. Flat-ended, side-firing, <b>radial,</b> <b>double</b> <b>radial</b> and diffusing fiber optic probes, having different beam shapes, were developed by using mechanical polishing and also, CO 2 laser polishing technique was demonstrated for fining radial fiber tips for the first time throughout this study. The probes were analyzed in terms of ray tracing, Zemax modelling, fabrication and light de ection. As a result, the spatial distribution of the fabricated probes were optimized. Different beam shapes originating from each fiber optic probe can serve for specific purposes. One of them is to use the diffusing probe as a cladding light stripper (CLS) in the fiber laser cavity since it improves the beam quality of the fiber laser. On the other hand, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is one of the operations that at, <b>radial</b> and <b>double</b> <b>radial</b> probes are preferred for ablating the varicose vein re ux, which is a common disease seen in 25...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{harvesting}} the fruits, a {{very time}} demanding task is removing old leaves from cucumber and tomato plants grown in greenhouses. To {{be able to}} automate this process by a robot, a leaf detection method is required. One possibility for the detection is to exploit the different dynamic behaviour of leaves and stems in case they are excited by mechanical impulse such as an airstream. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate this technique using a camera and image analysis. For the experiments carried out, images of a tomato crop were used. Images were taken with a digital camera from different distances. To generate an air stream, different <b>radial</b> <b>blowers</b> were used. A sequence of 5 digital images was recorded with a sample rate of 1 second with different settings. To find the differences between the images, the intensity of the images were mathematically subtracted. The resulting binary images were further processed with the aim to extract the leaf positions. These steps included automatic thresh-holding, noise reduction and morphological image analysis operations. It was found that moving objects in the images could be detected using the method described above. Budging objects could only successfully be traced if colour, intensity or structure of the moving object differed with the colour, intensity or structure of the background. The blowing direction had a strong influence on the movements.

The School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering of the North-West University is {{currently}} {{doing research on}} active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems. One of the latest developments is the flexible rotor <b>double</b> <b>radial</b> AMB model. Various studies on the AMB sub-systems are being conducted using the model. The focus {{of this study is}} on AMB power amplifiers (PAS). The aim is to develop a platform to facilitate the analysis of the two-state and the three-state switching techniques that are possible for the AMB switch-mode PAS. An average current controlled PA prototype board is designed to facilitate the study. The design of the switch-mode PA for the two-state and the three-state switching techniques is conducted and analysed based on the design specification. The switching techniques are realised in a digital signal processing (DSP) environment with a TMS 320 P 2812 eZdsp DSP starter kit (DSK). A TMS 320 P 2812 eZdsp DSK is programmed in visSim® development software. The simulation model for the two switching techniques was developed in MATLAB® simulink. The simulation models are used to verify the design specifications, to predict the experimental set-up behaviour and to compare the two-state and the three-state switch-mode PA topologies. The two switching techniques showed good correlation in system performance, small signal bandwidth and power bandwidth. The simulation models' responses are also in agreement with the theoretical analysis. Testing of the PA's switching techniques was conducted on the <b>double</b> <b>radial</b> AMB system. The two switching techniques are analysed on the basis of how well they can regulate the coil current. The power bandwidth as well as the power loss analysis was used to evaluate the two switching techniques. The experimental results showed good correlation with the simulation results in terms of the dynamic response and the power losses. The power bandwidth measurements could not be performed at the specified dc levels due to noise problems. The power bandwidth prediction was however verified by reducing the voltage level to minimum values and the switching frequency to lower value. Recommendations for future improvements on the PAS are given based on the results. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering at the North-West University is in {{the process}} of {{establishing}} a knowledge base on Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). In support of this initiative this project is aimed at characterising an in-house developed <b>double</b> <b>radial</b> heteropolar AMB system. Before characterising the AMB system the acoustic noise problem of the system had to be addressed and reduced to an acceptable level. To reduce the acoustic noise of the system a noise analysis was done to determine the source of the noise. The analysis revealed radiated noise from the electromagnets and power amplifiers (PA) and conducted noise on the signals to and from the controller. The conducted noise is reduced by using anti-aliasing (AAF) and anti-imaging filters (AIF) before and after the controller. The effect of the radiated noise is reduced by synchronising the sampling of the sensor signals with the switching of the PAS. The characterisation of the AMB system starts with a Mass-Spring-Damper (MSD) simulation which is a linear representation of the AMB system. This simulation is used to understand the basic principles of a second order system and to compare its response to the nonlinear AMB simulation. The following step in characterising the AMB system is to determine the effect of filters on the nonlinear AMB simulation and to determine the simulation characteristics. These characteristics are compared to the MSD simulation and the actual AMB system. The characteristics compared between the MSD and AMB simulations are the static, second order and dynamic stiffness. The actual AMB system was characterised before and after the AAF and AIF were implemented. This provided the opportunity to determine the effects of the filters on the actual system and not just from simulations. The characteristics measured on the actual AMB system include the static stiffness, dynamic stiffness, rotor dynamics and system sensitivity. The stiffness characteristics of the actual AMB system showed good correlation with the linear and nonlinear simulations. The measured results showed a decrease in static stiffness and an increase in system sensitivity because of the AAF, AIF and controller pole. It also showed that the effects of the filters can be reduced by moving the controller pole to a higher frequency. The characterisation of the <b>double</b> <b>radial</b> heteropolar AMB system provides a fundamental understanding of the AMB performance aiding the AMB design process. Master...|$|R
