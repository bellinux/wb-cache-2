From a functional perspective, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> is described as supporting laxation, attenuating blood glucose responses and assisting with cholesterol lowering. The problem is different types of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> have different effects, and new effects are increasingly observed, such as the influence on gut microbiota.

To begin this process, a review of individual fibre types and their physiological effects would be helpful. <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> is a complex group of substances, and there is a growing interest in specific effects linked to fibre type.

40|$|<b>Dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> is {{included}} in dog foods primarily to ensure good faecal quality. Too much <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre,</b> however, can have anti–nutritive effects. These effects mainly consist of reduced nutrient and mineral digestibilities and poor faecal quality. Increasing the level of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> {{in the formulation of}} dog food is desirable because these ingredients tend to be inexpensive. Therefore, enhanced breakdown of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> within the gastro–intestinal tract would be advantageous, and may allow increased inclusions of fibrous ingredients in dog foods. One method of achieving this is to add exogenous feed enzymes to the food. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre,</b> phytate and exogenous feed enzymes in dog foods. An increase in the soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> (non–starch polysaccharide, sNSP) content caused reduced nutrient digestibilities, increased fermentation in the large intestine and resulted in poor (moist, loose) faecal quality. The addition of the appropriate feed enzyme reduced these effects at the moderate level of inclusion of sNSP. Increased inclusion of a phytate–rich source of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> caused mild reductions in nutrient digestibilities, firmer faeces and increased phosphorus digestibility. The results of these experiments suggest that the most effective use of exogenous feed enzymes appears to be in degrading moderate inclusions (16. 3 g sNSP/kg DM) of soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{degradation}} of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the large intestine, is monitored using in vitroand in vivostudies. First, an in vitromethod to simulate the conditions in the mouth, stomach and small intestine was adapted for food products, which were used in an in vivosatiation study as well. Alginate, a dietary fibre that is able to form a gel under stomach conditions, {{was found to be}} more satiating than cellulose and guar gum. Next, in vitrofermentation were performed in addition to in vivostudies using pigs as models for humans. The rates and products of dietary fibre fermentation depend on the constituent monosaccharide and linkage compositions, degree of polymerisation and molecular conformation of the <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{as well as on the}} adaptability of the microbiota to the <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres.</b> The <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> investigated in the in vivopig studies included resistant starch, alginate and non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) from other feed components. The large intestinal digesta and faecal samples were analysed to study how <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> are degraded in the large intestine. Resistant starch was found to be preferred by the microbiota over NSPs. Hence, the utilisation of NSPs was delayed in the presence of resistant starch. The alginate used in the study was not fully utilised by the microbiota and more than 40 %(w/w) of the alginate intake was excreted in the faeces. The degradation products of alginate included an insoluble alginate fraction with increased guluronic acid content compared to the parental alginate. In addition, alginate oligosaccharides were formed. The time needed by the microbiota to adapt to different <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> varied. For resistant starch, two weeks of adaptation was sufficient, but more than 39 days was required to adapt to alginate. The fermentability differences among diverse <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> led to the conclusion that consumption of a changing diet containing various <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> may ensure that fermentation occurs throughout the colon.    ...|$|E

40|$|Gestating sows {{are usually}} fed {{low levels of}} feed, which may not provide {{sufficient}} satiety, and does not allow sows to fully fulfil their motivation to express foraging and feeding behaviours. Feed restriction may therefore lead to high occurrences of non-feeding oral activities, including stereotypies, and restlessness and aggressive behaviour in grouphoused sows, which are interpreted as signals of sustained feeding motivation and frustration. Inclusion of fibres in the diet reduces the energy density of diets and therefore allows for larger meal sizes without increasing the energy supplied. Moreover, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> influence the mechanisms that enhance satiation and satiety at the sensory, postingestive and post-absorptive levels. This chapter reviews the impact of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> on behaviour and welfare of gestating sows, and describes their potential consequences for performance. <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> generally reduce the occurrence of stereotypies and decrease restlessness and activity, with some studies also reporting reduced aggression. These effects are most likely related to behavioural and physiological mechanisms underlying the impact of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> on satiety and feeding motivation. The extent of the response to <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> is, however, variable and depends {{on the characteristics of}} the fibrous diet (inclusion rate, fibre source, physicochemical properties), housing and feeding conditions, and characteristics of the sows, especially parity, with greater effects in younger sows. <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> provided during gestation usually result in increased feed intake of sows during lactation, probably due to their effects on the size and capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. Studies on the effects of fibres on reproductive performance are scarce and show variable results, which might partly be attributed to over- or underestimation of the energy content of the diet during pregnancy. In conclusion, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> generally have a beneficial effect on the behaviour and welfare of gestating sows which are restrictedfed.

The present review examines the influence of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> on the digestive processes and the consequences on pig protein and energy nutrition, health concerns and environmental issues. <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> is defined as the plant polysaccharides that are resistant to digestive secretions and are potentially available for bacterial fermentation in the intestines of single-stomached animals. Resistant starch is also considered as a <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre.</b> The short-chain fatty acids released by bacteria contribute to the host energy supply and both regulate the composition of the flora and the growth of epithelial cells, {{especially in the case of}} butyrate. The bacterial growth supported by the fermentation induces a shift of N excretion from urine to faeces. Beside the fermentability, the physical properties of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> such as the water-holding capacity, the viscosity and the solubility influence the digestion, the satiety and the transit time.

AimsTo quantitatively assess the association between <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> intake and mortality from CVD and all cancers. MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase databases for all articles published up to September  2014 and via hand searching. Study-specific estimates adjusting for potential confounders were combined to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), using a random-effects model. ResultsWe found 15  studies that examined the association between <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> and mortality from CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD) and all cancers. The pooled RRs of CVD, CHD and all-cancer mortality for the highest versus lowest category of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> were 0. 77 (95 % CI: 0. 71 – 0. 84), 0. 76 (95 % CI: 0. 67 – 0. 87) and 0. 86 (95 % CI: 0. 79 – 0. 93), respectively. In a dose-response meta-analysis, the pooled RRs for an increment of 10 g/day in <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> intake were 0. 91 (95 % CI: 0. 88 – 0. 94) for CVD, 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 85 – 0. 93) for CHD and 0. 94 (95 % CI: 0. 91 – 0. 97) for all cancers. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that high <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> intake {{is associated with a}} reduced risk of mortality from CVD and all cancers. These results support the current recommendation that high <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> intake should be part of a healthy diet...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the process of extrusion of blends of corn semolina and pea hulls to determine the effect of the share of high-fibre material and of parameters of the process of extrusion eg extruder barrel temperature and material moisture content, on the solubility of dry matter, viscosity, and content of fundamental chemical components &# 8211; proteins, fats, and <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> in the extrudates. Detailed analysis were performed for changes taking place in the <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> fractions. Also analyzed were changes in the content of total <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> as determined with the enzymatic method, including the fractions of soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> and insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre.</b> The study showed that extrusion cooking leads to a reduction in the content of crude fibre and free fats, and to a slight reduction in the level of proteins in the processed material. No significant changes were observed in the content of ash. Extrusion cooking resulted in decreased content of neutral-detergent fibre, acid-detergent fibre and cellulose fractions; {{at the same time a}} reduction was observed in the content of insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> and an increase in the content of soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> fractions. It was found that intensive parameters of the process of extrusion (low moisture content of material and high process temperature) resulted in increased water solubility index values for the extrudates. The highest viscosity (after heating and cooling of suspension to 20 °C) was characteristic of products obtained with the application of process temperature of 125 °C...|$|R
40|$|After {{processing}} of citrus fruits (e. g. lemon, orange, grapefruit, mandarin) for juice and essential oils production, approximately 50 % {{of the original}} fruit mass is left as waste material. Citrus crops processing by-products are valuable components as they contain nutrients such as pectins, saccharides, carotenoids, some vitamins, minerals, polyphenols and substances with antioxidant activity. Utilisation of these kind of side products in the recipe of various cereal product led to enhancement of final product nutritional value and better sensory attributes as well as improvement of product functional properties. In this work was studied the effect of orange and mandarin <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> application at level 5 and 10 % (w/w) in tarhana preparation and the influence on tarhana fermentation process. Chemical analysis showed, that <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> preparations reached higher concentration of ash, fat and total <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> compared to wheat flour. Wheat flour exhibited higher moisture content and protein concentration than citrus <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> preparations. Orange and mandarin <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> preparations showed higher values of water and oil absorption capacity, swelling capacity and least gellation concentration compared to wheat flour. Application of fruit <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> preparations to tarhana recipe caused a rapid decrease in pH from 4. 70 - 5. 02 to values 4. 31 - 4. 51 during fermentation process. Reducing saccharides served as an available source of energy for fermenting microbiota and their concentration decreased from 24. 5 - 32. 8 to 2. 2 - 0. 2 g/kg after 144 h incubation. Fermentation also led to lactic acid (1. 67 - 2. 09 g/kg) and acetic acid (1. 91 - 2. 53 g/kg) production {{as a consequence of}} present microorganisms metabolic activity. Sensory evaluation of samples showed, that higher proportion of citrus <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> preparations (10 %) negatively affected taste, odour, consistency and sourness. Among all prepared tarhana samples with proportion of citrus <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> preparation was the most acceptable tarhana with 5 % of mandarin <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre.</b> <!
