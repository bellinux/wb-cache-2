The modulation conditions should be different from mt-DSC since the sample and test fixture and enclosure is larger thus requiring longer <b>equilibration</b> <b>time.</b> mt-DSC typically uses a period of 60 s, amplitude 0.5-1.0 °C and average heating or cooling rate of 2 °C·min-1.

50|$|On a {{microscopic}} scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring {{some of their}} energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction {{is the most significant}} means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact. Fluids—especially gases—are less conductive. Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. The process of heat transfer {{from one place to another}} place without the movement of particles is called conduction. Example: Heat transfer through Metal rods.

The <b>equilibration</b> <b>time</b> for replica exchange is analyzed for both systems. For the double well system, parallel tempering with a number of replicas that scales as the square root of the barrier height yields exponential speedup of the <b>equilibration</b> <b>time.</b> On the other hand, replica exchange yields only marginal speed-up for the golf course system.
