2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E

She has said, [...] "He was on his deathbed. We knew {{it was the last time}} we were seeing each other; he <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me.

Unharmed, he wandered to Quicken Loans Arena where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting Cavalier fans. [...] "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?.

60|$|And {{after that}} she was all right. At least, you would have said so. She talked a lot at dinner, and chaffed Bobbie, and played us ragtime on the piano afterwards, as if she hadn't {{a care in the}} world. Quite a jolly little party it was--not. I'm no lynx-eyed sleuth, and all that sort of thing, but I had seen her face at the beginning, and I knew that she was working the whole time and working hard, to keep herself in hand, and that she would have given that diamond what's-its-name in her hair and {{everything}} else she possessed to have one good scream--just one.

60|$|Leo {{already had}} his rifle in his hand. I {{called to him}} to wait till they were nearer, and {{meanwhile}} <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> own. Some fifteen feet from us the water shallowed on a bank to the depth of about fifteen inches, and presently the first of them--it was the lioness--got on to it, shook herself, and roared. At that moment Leo fired, the bullet went right down her open mouth and out {{at the back of}} her neck, and down she dropped, with a splash, dead. The other lion--a full-grown male--was some two paces behind her. At this second he got his forepaws on to the bank, when a strange thing happened. There was a rush and disturbance of the water, such as one sees in a pond in England when a pike takes a little fish, only a thousand times fiercer and larger, and suddenly the lion gave a most terrific snarling roar and sprang forward on to the bank, dragging something black with him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was anxious}} I should assent to his theory. And indeed on {{thinking}} it over {{it would have}} been plausible enough if there hadn't been always the essential falseness of irresponsibility in Schomberg's chatter. However, I was not disposed to investigate the psychology of Falk. I was engaged just then in eating despondently a piece of stale Dutch cheese, being too much crushed to care what I swallowed myself, let along bothering my head about Falk's ideas of gastronomy. I could expect from their study no clue to his conduct in matters of business, which seemed to me totally unrestrained by morality or even by the commonest sort of decency. How insignificant and contemptible I must appear, for the fellow to dare treat me like this--I reflected suddenly, writhing in silent agony. And I consigned Falk and all his peculiarities to the devil with so much mental fervour as to forget Schomberg's existence, till he <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> arm urgently.

Well, the American husband is old Dryfoos all over; no mustache; and hay-colored chin-whiskers cut slanting froze the corners of his mouth. He cocked his little gray eyes at me, and says he: 'Yes, young man; my name is Dryfoos, and I'm from Moffitt. But I don't want no present of Longfellow's Works, illustrated; and I don't want to taste no fine teas; but I know a policeman that does; and if you're the son of my old friend Squire Strohfeldt, you'd better get out.'

6000|$|In the {{confusion}} and dim light of bedtime I contrived to throw {{the end of my}} lasso over the horn of a saddle hanging on the wall, with the intention of augmenting the noise I soon expected to create; and I placed my automatic rifle and [...] .38 S. and W. Special within easy reach of my hand. Then I crawled into my bag and composed myself to listen. Frank soon began to snore, so brazenly, so fictitiously, that I wondered at the man's absorbed intensity in his joke; and I was at great pains to smother in my breast a violent burst of riotous merriment. Jones's snores, however, were real enough, and this made me enjoy the situation all the more; because if he did not show a mild surprise when the catastrophe fell, I would greatly miss my guess. I knew the three wily conspirators were wide-awake. Suddenly I felt a movement in the straw under me and a faint rustling. It was so soft, so sinuous, that if I had not known it was the lasso, I would assuredly have been frightened. I gave a little jump, such as one will make quickly in bed. Then the coil ran out from under the straw. How subtly suggestive of a snake! I made a slight outcry, a big jump, paused a moment for effectiveness in which time Frank forgot to snore--then let out a tremendous yell, <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> guns, sent twelve thundering shots through the roof and pulled my lasso.|$|E
