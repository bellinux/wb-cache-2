2500|$|Brian Eno {{wrote of}} Lomax's later {{recording}} career in his notes to accompany {{an anthology of}} Lomax's world recordings: [...] turned his intelligent attentions to music from {{many other parts of}} the world, securing for them a dignity and status they had not previously been accorded. The [...] "World Music" [...] phenomenon arose partly from those efforts, as did his great book, Folk Song Style and Culture. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most important}} books ever written about music, in my all time top ten. It is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a serious, comprehensible, and rational footing by someone who had the experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{introduced}} a [...] "Then and Now" [...] structure, which utilizes flashbacks that bookend the episode; flashbacks {{were used in}} previous seasons of the television series, and were sparsely used in the graphic novels the series is based on. Although Gimple stated that this feature would not be seen throughout the season, he said, [...] "We definitely play with time this season. And we’ll be jumping around a little bit, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> our only Then and Now." [...] Kirkman noted that the audience [...] " [...] so much more about Gareth {{and all of those}} people because of those two very minor scenes." [...] Gimple knew the backstory of Terminus while the characters were traveling there in the previous season, and stated that it echoes what happens next to Rick's group. The writers wanted to divulge and formulate the [...] "whole story" [...] of Terminus that affects the characters of the show; he related the stories of everyone in their universe to [...] "walking ghosts of Christmas Future and ghosts of Christmas Past to [...] characters." ...|$|E

50|$|Park Recordshttps://parkre.secureconnection.com/index.php have re-released Tim Hart's Very Favorite Nursery Rhyme Record; a 2-CD album {{containing}} 32 tracks. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> done to {{help pay}} for his cancer treatment, hopefully the money will now be used towards some sort of memorial for Tim.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] said Hale, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the package}} taken from Colonel Clinch. Is it not?" [...] he added, {{appealing}} to the Colonel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am the new boy, sir," [...] exclaimed this youth, on entering; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the right}} door, and {{you asked for}} these things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a letter}} for Pierre Glendinning," [...] said the stranger, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> he." [...] At the same moment, a letter was drawn forth, and sought his hand.|$|E
60|$|I {{replied that}} <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> so. Then {{he asked me}} {{of the value of}} the gold of which I had spoken. I told him and it was a great sum, for gold was scarce in Egypt. His eyes gleamed for he needed wealth to pay soldiers.|$|R
25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|R

60|$|CHARLES. And {{there are}} two {{brothers}} of his, William and Walter Blunt, Esquires, both members of Parliament, and noted speakers; and, what's very extraordinary, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the first time they}} were ever bought or sold.|$|E
5000|$|I do not {{and shall}} {{not believe that}} Lord Buddha was the {{incarnation}} of Vishnu. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> to <b>be</b> sheer madness and false propaganda.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is true," [...] said Betty. [...] "Indeed <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a healthy}} sleep. See how gently she breathes, how soft and natural her colour is, how cool and fresh her cheek is. I cannot {{believe there is}} serious harm done." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{river is}} not {{extraordinarily}} interesting between Streatley and Wallingford. From Cleve {{you get a}} stretch of {{six and a half}} miles without a lock. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the longest uninterrupted stretch anywhere above Teddington, and the Oxford Club make use of it for their trial eights.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{began by}} saying that one report was false, Mrs. Cadwallader, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> false too," [...] said Dorothea, with indignant energy; [...] "at least, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation. I will not hear any evil spoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already {{suffered}} too much injustice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I daren't--that is, I won't promise. <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> now, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> some trap of your Jewish intrigue, {{just to make}} me commit myself {{against those}} Christians, whom you hate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR FAIRCHILD,--I do {{not live}} in the Post Office; that is only my address; I live at [...] "Baker's," [...] a house upon a hill, and very jolly in every way. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going to do: we have a kind of a garret of a spare room, where hardy {{visitors}} can sleep, and our table (if homely) is not bad.|$|E
6000|$|... "S'nore, si. I {{will keep}} my mind clear {{and tell you}} {{no more than one}} thing at a time. I believe, eccellenza, I am to begin with where I saw her; then I'm to tell you when I saw her; after which you wish to know what she was about. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the way you put it, S'nore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This,' said Mr Pecksniff, {{throwing}} wide {{the door}} of the memorable two-pair front; 'is a room where some talent has been developed <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a room in which an idea for a steeple occurred to me that I may one day give to the world. We work here, my dear Martin. Some architects have been bred in this room; a few, I think, Mr Pinch?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went in {{and there}} was my father fallen forward on the dining-room table, with blood coming from his lips, though <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> caused by a crushed wineglass. His pocket-book was open beneath him, {{in which he had}} been writing figures of his estate, and, I think, {{headings}} for the will he meant to make, but these I could not read since the faint pencilling was blotted out with blood. He was quite dead from some kind of a stroke followed by heart failure, as the doctors said." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} moving line ever installed. The idea {{came in a}} general way from the {{overhead}} trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.|$|R

60|$|Both of {{my parents}} were dead to me. My mother died when I was but five years old. She was of a {{delicate}} nature, and, strange as it may seem, I am inclined {{to believe that it}} was for the best that her death occurred when it did. The reason <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is,</b> because she was thus spared the disgrace that came upon our family several years later.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{a little}} previous," [...] he said. [...] "But come round in another day or so, and I {{may be able}} to do {{something}} for you." [...] He moved with a certain conspirator-like caution to a corner of the room, and, lifting to one side a pile of canvases, revealed a stout barrel, which, he regarded with a fatherly and benignant eye. [...] "I don't mind telling you that, in the fullness of time, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going to spread a good deal of sweetness and light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know yet. I want to {{get hold}} of a good plot. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> very {{necessary}} from an editor's point of view. The only thing I've settled on is the heroine's name. It is to be AVERIL LESTER. Rather pretty, don't you think? Don't mention this to any one, Diana. I haven't told anybody but you and Mr. Harrison. HE wasn't very encouraging--he said there was far too much trash written nowadays as it was, and he'd expected something better of me, after a year at college." ...|$|E
5000|$|... ‘Teach For India is {{becoming}} a force for driving positive change {{in this country as}} it impactsfutures and changes lives. Its story needs to <b>be</b> told and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> book <b>is</b> an importantstep in spreading its message.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Curse Of Dracula" [...] (1979-). Count Dracula {{is alive}} and well and {{teaching}} college in 1979. The series's Director: Jeffrey Hayden, Richard Milton. Lasted one season in length. And this series featured stars were: Michael Nouri (as Dracula), Stephen Johnson, Carol Baxter, Antoinette Stella. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the series that featured flash-back memories of Count Dracula, the vampire using sepia-tone to emphasis it was a different era of time. (Michael Nouri later would star in the popular film of its era [...] "Flashdance" [...] in 1983; and later also in the 1987 Sci-fi movie [...] "The Hidden").|$|R
60|$|No doubt, I ought {{either to}} have left the morning-room, or to have let my aunt know of my {{presence}} there. I did neither the one nor the other. Her first dislike of Michael had, to all appearance, subsided. She had once or twice actually taken opportunities of speaking to him kindly. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to the caprice of the moment. The tone of her voice too suggested, on this occasion, that she had some spiteful object in view, in sending for him. I knew it was unworthy of me--and yet, I deliberately waited to hear what passed between them.|$|R
