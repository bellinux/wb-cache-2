(2016), Fluid dynamic design of an axial rotor for hydrokinetic riverbed turbine-improvement introduced by a high lift <b>foil</b> <b>profile.</b> Environ. Prog. Sustainable Energy, 35 : 1198 – 1206. doi: 10. 1002 /ep. 12320], which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. The main objective {{of this article is to}} achieve a very high lift rotor to take the maximum advantage of the kinetic energy of a slow velocity water flow, which belongs to a lowland river type. Low speed flux and lack of depth are the main obstacles in hydrokinetic operation. The use of a high lift aerodynamic profile and the gain of the rotor number of blades serve to accomplish the task. This work presents the fluid dynamic design for an axial hydrokinetic turbine rotor, studied in a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical simulation by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The use of CFD techniques avoids some physical model assays. For the hydrokinetic turbine rotor design, first a one-dimensional (1 D) theoretical design was carried out, starting with the selection of a suitable airfoil profile to create the hydrofoil blade. Then, the 3 D rotor geometry was defined and studied carefully by means of CFD, to check its hydrodynamic behavior, that is, lift and drag, streamline velocities and pressure fields. The CFD results were obtained using an open CFD code (Kratos) Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic change in}} nation’s climate policies around the world toward a less carbon dependent energy production. This has given rise to a rapid expansion within the renewable energy sector and a wide range of alternative energy technology is in development and in use at this day. One of these upcoming technologies are the Marine Current Turbines (MCT’s) which are currently undergoing extensive research and testing in the UK. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the performance of a novel mooring and station keeping device for a MCT {{in the form of a}} buoyant hydrofoil. The hydrofoil was designed to generate lift in the tidal stream in addition to its buoyancy and is therefore proposed to be a more efficient station keeping device than a submerged buoy. The analysis of the hydrofoil was done by steady- state computational fluid dynamics studies where several different geometrical configurations were compared in terms of the generated mooring angle. The devices were also evaluated in construction complexity and the ratio between generated buoyancy and lift. The study was divided into two parts where the first one was a 2 D study aimed at determining the most suitable <b>foil</b> <b>profile</b> for the device. The second part of the thesis was devoted to finding the approximate dimensions for the hydrofoil using a 3 D analysis setup. The findings showed that the most suitable foil shapes were the Joukowski and the NACA 0025 profiles and the dimensions of the hydrofoil for a 10 m diameter, 250 kW turbine was 7 m in chord length and 17 m in width. The findings also showed that adding circular end plates to the NACA 0025 geometry greatly improved its performance and gave a final mooring angle of 38. 49 degrees. The findings in this thesis should be considered as a ‘proof of concept’ rather than accurate data to base critical design factors on. This is due to several constraints imposed partially by the limited processing power available and the lack of data from the turbulent flow conditions in tidal streams. A lot of research remains to be done before the concept is confidently proven to work in practice, but, according to the author, this thesis provides grounds that there is good reason to further the development of the concept.

40|$|ABSTRACTEnergy is {{a direct}} {{restriction}} to the working life of an underwater mooring platform (UMP). In this paper, a vertical axis water turbine (VAWT) is designed to supply energy for UMPs. The VAWT has several controlled blades, which can be opened or closed by inside plunger pumps. Two-dimensional transient numerical studies are presented to determine the operating performance and power output of the turbine under low ocean current velocity. A standard k-ε turbulence model is used to perform the transient simulations. The influence of structural parameters, including <b>foil</b> section <b>profile,</b> <b>foil</b> chord length and rotor diameter, on the turbine performance are investigated over a range of tip-speed-ratios (TSRs).

40|$|As signal {{frequencies}} {{continue to}} increase, conductor surface roughness losses of interconnects {{are becoming more}} prominent. There is currently no industry standard for separating the dielectric and conductor losses that appear in PCBs. As part of the thesis work, test vehicles composed of six different dielectric materials were fabricated with different trace widths, copper <b>foil</b> <b>profiles,</b> and oxide surface treatments. A Feedback-Based Model was used to simulate and extract the dielectric and conductor losses from measurements made with the different test vehicles. Simulation software such as MATLAB, Agilent ADS, and Polar Si 9000 were utilized. Dielectric material Megtron 4 had the lowest Df of the materials of interest. The Feedback Based Model was able to fit the data well for either low frequencies and high frequencies, but not both. Further, the model was able to model the effects of changes in copper roughness well. Small variations were seen in the extracted Df associated with changes in width of the measurement traces. by Michelle Rybak. Thesis: M.

40|$|In {{flapping}} underwater vehicles the propulsive {{performance of}} harmonically sinusoidal heaving and pitching foil will be degraded by some awkward changes in effective {{angle of attack}} profile, as the Strouhal number increases. This paper surveys different angle of attack profiles (Sinusoidal, Square, Sawtooth and Cosine) and considers their thrust production ability. In {{the wide range of}} Strouhal numbers, thrust production of Square profile is considerable but it has a discontinuity in heave velocity profile, in which an infinite acceleration exists. This problem poses a significant defect in control of flapping <b>foil.</b> A novel <b>profile</b> function is proposed to omit sharp changes in heave velocity and acceleration. Furthermore, an optimum profile is found for different Strouhal numbers with respect to Square angle of attack profile...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{studies on}} the GEM foil {{material}} are performed to measure the moisture diffusion rate and saturation level. These studies are important because {{the presence of this}} compound inside the detector's foil can possibly change its mechanical and electrical properties and, in such a way, the detector performance can be affected. To understand this phenomenon, a model is developed with COMSOL Multhiphysics v. 4. 3, which described the adsorption and diffusion within the geometry of GEM <b>foil,</b> the concentration <b>profiles</b> and the time required to saturate the foil. The COMSOL model is verified by experimental observations on a GEM foil sample. This note will describe the model and its experimental verification results.

40|$|A unique {{strategy}} {{is reported to}} constrain the nucleation centers for multilayer graphene (MLG) and, later, single-crystal graphene domains by gettering carbon source on backside of the flat Cu foil, during chemical vapor deposition. Hitherto, for a flat Cu foil, the top-surface-based growth mechanism is emphasized, while overlooking the graphene on the backside. However, the systematic experimental findings indicate {{a strong correlation between}} the backside graphene and the nucleation centers on the top-surface, governed by the carbon diffusion through the bulk Cu. This understanding steers to devise a strategy to mitigate the carbon diffusion to the top-surface by using a carbon “getter” substrate, such as nickel, on the backside of the Cu <b>foil.</b> Depth <b>profiling</b> of the nickel substrate, along with the density functional theory calculations, verifies the gettering role of the nickel support. The implementation of the backside carbon gettering approach on single-crystal graphene growth results in lowering the nucleation density by two orders of magnitude. This enables the single-crystal domains to grow by 6 mm laterally on the untreated Cu foil. Finally, the growth of large-area polycrystalline single layer graphene, free of unwanted MLG domains, with significantly improved field-effect mobility of ≈ 6800 cm^ 2 V^(− 1) s^(− 1) is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the use of}} thin <b>foil</b> conical <b>profile</b> X-ray mirrors for high energy, large aperture, and {{lightweight}} telescopes is investigated. The telescope performance is studied using analytical solutions and ray tracing simulations. Expressions {{for the number of}} mirrors in a module, the collecting area, the efficiency of aperture utilisation, and the resolution are calculated for on-axis sources. For off-axis sources ray tracing is used and expressions to describe the performance are derived empirically. The sensitivity and effect of singly reflected rays on the image are also investigated, and the comparison is made with Wolter (I) profile optics. A technique for the production of super-smooth surfaces using a layer of acrylic lacquer is described. Several materials have been coated using this method to assess their suitability as potential mirror substrates. To quantitatively assess the quality of both substrate and lacquer finishes a program of X-ray scattering measurements has been carried out. Several different types of surfaces have been examined both before and after lacquer coating. Particular attention has been payed to the ability of the lacquer to remove surface features of different spatial wavelengths. An epoxy replicated test flat is also examined which provides an interesting comparison with the lacquer coating technique for the production of thin X-ray mirrors. As a consequence of the wide range of materials examined it has been possible to compare most of the different techniques for producing thin X-ray mirrors. There is no one solution for all applications and thin foil mirrors are indeed a competitive technology...|$|R
40|$|Research on ADS, related new {{fuels and}} their ability for nuclear waste {{incineration}} leads to a revival of interest in nuclear cross-sections of many nuclides in a large energy range. Discrepancies observed between nuclear databases require new measurements in several cases. A complete measurement of such cross-sections including resonance resolution consists in an extensive beam time experiment associated to a long analysis. With a slowing down spectrometer associated to a pulsed neutron source, {{it is possible to}} determine a good cross-section profile in an energy range from 0. 1 eV to 40 keV by making use of a slowing-down time lead spectrometer associated to a pulsed neutron source. These measurements performed at ISN (Grenoble) with the neutron source GENEPI requires only small quantities of matter (as small as 0. 1 g) and about one day of beam by target. We present cross-section profile measurements and an experimental study of the self-shielding effect. A CeF 3 scintillator coupled with a photomultiplier detects gamma rays from neutronic capture in the studied target. The neutron flux is also measured with a 233 U fission detector and a 3 He detector at symmetrical position to the PM in relation to the neutron source. Absolute flux values are given by activation of Au and W <b>foils.</b> The cross-section <b>profiles</b> can then be deduced from the target captur...|$|R
40|$|For centuries {{scientists}} have looked to nature for inspiration for novel and efficient solutions to engineering problems. Recently, research on {{fish and other}} marine mammals has shown their ability to efficiently extract energy from both steady and unsteady flows. Our research uses this previous work as motivation for experimentally examining the hydrodynamic performance of flapping foils to extract energy in a two-dimensional flow. We focused on identifying the effects that foil motion parameters had on the hydrodynamic energy extraction efficiency and resolving the wake structure downstream of the foil. The primary foil motion parameters investigated were the non-dimensional flapping frequency of the foil, the non-dimensional excursion amplitude of the <b>foil,</b> and the <b>profile</b> of the <b>foil</b> path during a typical energy extraction cycle. The heave and pitch of the fin was approximated by a NACA 0012 foil heaving and pitching sinusoidially 90 ° out of phase at a Reynolds number of 13, 800. Energy extraction efficiencies of up to [eta] = 0. 45 were found within a very small parametric region for small oscillation amplitudes while broad regions of appreciable efficiency were found at large oscillation amplitudes. The highest efficiency regions were all found to exhibit the same 2 P vortex shedding mode. Further, the similitude between experiments for varying oscillation amplitude was not consistent when parameterized by the Strouhal number. This study shows parameterizing the flapping frequency by the reduced frequency results in vortex modes and efficiency contours aligning between varying oscillation amplitudes. by Bradley James Simpson.

40|$|Validation and {{verification}} of numerical experiments require data {{with which to}} compare the results. In particular, hybrid methods that involve grid interfaces between multiple numerical solutions on submerged boundaries or at the free surface require volumetric measurements for validation. In this study, two methods to obtain a comprehensive data set including volumetric three dimensional, three component (3 D 3 C) fluid velocities, free surface profiles and drag force are com- pared for accuracy and economy. For the first method, a NACA 0012 surface piercing foil is evaluated at Froude numbers 0 : 19, 0 : 37 and 0 : 55. Velocity measurements are obtained using Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) with the interrogation plane parallel to the chord line of the <b>foil.</b> Free surface <b>profiles</b> are obtained using a GoPro camera positioned to observe {{the intersection of the}} free surface and the laser sheet. Force data is obtained through a load cell mounted on the tow carriage. The second method positions the SPIV interrogation plane perpendicular to the chord of the foil such that the volume is sliced transversely while the foil passes through the plane in time. Surface elevations for this method are again measured with a GoPro, mounted to capture the intersection of the laser sheet and the free surface. The transverse method is examined at Froude number 0 : 37. Results are presented based on the flow field statistics and the fundamental features of the data sets are compared using dynamic mode decomposition. Comparison between the two methods are made qualitatively, as well as quantitatively using RMSE and Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The difference between the two methods is less than 10 % RMSE...|$|R
