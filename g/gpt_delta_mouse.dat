40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} the 2 nd leading {{cause of cancer death}} {{worldwide}} and the 4 th most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Helicobacter pylori infection is the major risk factor of gastric cancer, and as such, this bacterium has been classified as a type 1, or definite, carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. H. pylori infects the gastric mucosa of {{more than half of the}} world's population and promotes gastric carcinogenesis by inducing chronic inflammation. Over decades of persistent H. pylori infection and chronic inflammation, the stomach goes through a well characterized pathological progression involving chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and ultimately cancer. Interestingly, there are strong gender differences in the development of gastric cancer, as men are twice as likely to develop the disease than women. Given the importance of H. pylori and chronic inflammation in gastric carcinogenesis, this thesis investigated the role of gender in modulating host immune responses to H. pylori. The aims of this thesis explored 1) the effect of gender on H. pylori's ability to induce mutations and 2) the effect of estrogen and the anti-estrogen, Tamoxifen, on H. pyloriinduced gastric cancer. For the first aim, the <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> <b>mouse</b> model, a murine mutational analysis model, was used to study chronic infection with H. pylori. Increased frequency of point mutations was observed in infected female mice at 12 months post infection. These mutations were not observed in infected male mice. Further analysis revealed that H. pylori induced a greater immune response in female mice in this model, as measured by increased severity of gastric lesions, decreased bacterial counts and the higher levels of Th 1 antibodies for H. pylori. The spectra of mutations pointed towards oxidative damage as the underlying cause of induction. This study revealed that gender differences in mutagenesis were mediated by the severity and duration of the immune response. In the second aim, 17 [beta]-estradiol prevented the formation of gastric cancer in the INSGAS mouse model, which develops gastric cancer in a male-predominant manner. Unexpectedly, this study led to the discovery that Tamoxifen may act as an agonist in this model of gastric cancer, as it was able to prevent gastric cancer using mechanisms similar to 17 [beta]- estradiol. Both compounds downregulated pathways associated with cellular movement and cancer. CXCL 1, a murine homolog of IL- 8, was downregulated by treatment at both local and systemic levels, which led to a decreased neutrophilic infiltrate. 17 [beta]-estradiol and Tamoxifen mediated the disruption of a positive feedback loop coupling CXCL 1 secretion with neutrophil recruitment, which dampened the activation of proinflammatory and oncogenic pathways, leading to protection against gastric cancer. In conclusion, these studies provide further insight into the role of gender modulation of host immune response in H. pylori-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. by Alexander Sheh. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{manufactured}} nano/microparticles such as fullerenes (C 60), {{carbon black}} (CB) and ceramic fiber are being widely used {{because of their}} desirable properties in industrial, medical and cosmetic fields. However, there are few data on these particles in mammalian mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. To examine genotoxic effects by C 60, CB and kaolin, an in vitro micronuclei (MN) test was conducted with human lung cancer cell line, A 549 cells. In addition, DNA damage and mutations were analyzed by in vivo assay systems using male C 57 BL/ 6 J or <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic <b>mice</b> which were intratracheally instilled with single or multiple doses of 0. 2 mg per animal of particles. Results In in vitro genotoxic analysis, increased MN frequencies were observed in A 549 cells treated with C 60, CB and kaolin in a dose-dependent manner. These three nano/microparticles also induced DNA damage in the lungs of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice measured by comet assay. Moreover, single or multiple instillations of C 60 and kaolin, increased either or both of gpt and Spi - mutant frequencies in the lungs of <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic <b>mice.</b> Mutation spectra analysis showed transversions were predominant, and more than 60 % of the base substitutions occurred at G:C base pairs in the gpt genes. The G:C to C:G transversion was commonly increased by these particle instillations.

However, several studies have reported over the years of radiation-induced non-targeted/ abscopal effects in vivo that challenge this paradigm. There is evidence that Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2) plays an important role in modulating non-targeted effects, including DNA damages in vitro and mutagenesis in vivo. While most reports on radiation-induced non-targeted response utilize x-rays, there is little information available for heavy ions. Methods and Materials Adult female transgenic <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> <b>mice</b> were exposed to an equitoxic dose of either carbon or argon particles using the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Japan. The mice were stratified into 4 groups of 5 animals each: Control; animals irradiated under full shielding (Sham-irradiated); animals receiving whole body irradiation (WBIR); and animals receiving partial body irradiation (PBIR) to the lower abdomen with a 1 x 1 cm 2 field. The doses used in the carbon ion group (4. 5 Gy) and in argon particle group (1. 5 Gy) have a relative biological effectiveness equivalent to a 5 Gy dose of x-rays. 24 hours after irradiation, breast tissues in and out of the irradiated field were harvested for analysis. Induction of COX 2, 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), phosphorylated histone H 2 AX (γ-H 2 AX), and apoptosis-related cysteine protease- 3 (Caspase- 3) antibodies were examined in the four categories of breast tissues using immunohistochemical techniques. Analysis was performed by measuring the intensity of more than 20 individual microscopic fields and comparing the relative fold difference. Results In the carbon ion group, the relative fold increase in COX 2 expression was 1. 01 in sham-irradiated group (p > 0. 05), 3. 07 in PBIR (p 0. 05), 11. 31 in PBIR (p 0. 05), 8. 41 in PBIR (p < 0. 05) and 10. 59 in WBIR (p < 0. 05). Results for the argon particle therapy group showed a similar magnitude of changes in the various biological endpoints examined. There was no statistical significance observed in Caspase- 3 expression among the 4 groups.

Nanosized-magnetite (MGT) is widely utilized in medicinal and industrial fields, whereas their toxicological properties are not well documented. A safety assessment is thus urgently required for MGT, and genotoxicity {{is one of the}} most serious concerns. In the present study, we examined genotoxic effects of MGT using mice and revealed that DNA damage analyzed by a comet assay in the lungs of imprinting control region (ICR) mice intratracheally instilled with a single dose of 0. 05 or 0. 2 mg/animal of MGT was approximately two- to three-fold higher than that of vehicle-control animals. Furthermore, in <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic <b>mice,</b> <b>gpt</b> mutant frequency (MF) in the lungs of the group exposed to four consecutive doses of 0. 2 mg MGT was significantly higher than in the control group. Mutation spectrum analysis showed that base substitutions were predominantly induced by MGT, among which G:C to A:T transition and G:C to T:A transversion were the most significant. To clarify the mechanism of mutation caused by MGT, we analyzed the formation of DNA adducts in the lungs of mice exposed to MGT. DNA was extracted from lungs of mice 3, 24, 72 and 168 h after intratracheal instillation of 0. 2 mg/body of MGT, and digested enzymatically. 8 -Oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG) and lipid peroxide-related DNA adducts were quantified by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Compared with vehicle control, these DNA adduct levels were significantly increased in the MGT-treated mice. In addition to oxidative stress- and inflammation related-DNA adduct formations, inflammatory cell infiltration and focal granulomatous formations were also observed in the lungs of MGT-treated mice. Based on these findings, it is suggested that inflammatory responses are probably involved in the genotoxicity induced by MGT in the lungs of mice...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{trend in}} current toxicology is the replacement, reduction, and refinement {{of the use}} of experimental animals (the 3 R principle). We propose a model in which in vivo genotoxicity and short-term carcinogenicity assays are integrated with F 344 <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> transgenic rats. Using this model, the genotoxicity of chemicals can be identified in target organs using a shuttle vector l EG 10 that carries reporter genes for mutations; short-term carcinogenicity is determined by the formation of glutathione S-transferase placenta form (GST-P) foci in the liver. To begin validating this system, we examined the genotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of structural isomers of 2, 4 -diaminotoluene (2, 4 -DAT) and 2, 6 -diaminotoluene (2, 6 -DAT).

The tentative protocol for the GPG 46 model was developed {{based on the results}} of dose-response exposure to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and treatment with phenobarbital over time following DEN ad-ministration. Briefly, <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> rats were exposed to various chemicals for 4 weeks, followed by a partial hepatectomy (PH) to collect samples for an in vivo mutation assay. The mutant frequencies (MFs) of the reporter genes were examined as an indication of tumor initiation. A single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 10 mg/kg DEN was administered to rats 18 h after the PH to initiate hepatocytes. Tumor-promoting activity was evaluated based on the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) -positive foci at week 10.

Although recent {{studies suggest that}} COMMD 1 regulates hepatic copper export via an interaction with the Wilson disease protein ATP 7 B, its importance in hepatic copper homeostasis is ill-defined. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of Commd 1 deficiency on hepatic copper metabolism in mice. Liver-specific Commd 1 knockout <b>mice</b> (Commd 1 (<b>Delta</b> hep)) were generated and fed either a standard or a copper-enriched diet.

However, platelet aggregation and secretion in response to any agonist were near normal despite absence of initial platelet contraction.

We compared behavioural responses in two models of acute thermal pain following DPDPE and deltorphin II administration by intracerebroventricular route. In the tail-immersion test, both compounds were fully analgesic in <b>delta</b> knockout <b>mice</b> and totally inactive in mu knockout mice. In the hotplate test, the two compounds again produced full analgesia in <b>delta</b> knockout <b>mice.</b> In mu knockout mice, there was significant, although much lower, analgesia.

Tnnt 2 (+/-) mice relative to wildtype had significantly reduced transcript (0. 82 +/- 0. 06 [SD] vs. 1. 00 +/- 0. 12 arbitrary units; p = 0. 025), but not protein (1. 01 +/- 0. 20 vs. 1. 00 +/- 0. 13 arbitrary units; p = 0. 44). Tnnt 2 (+/-) mice had normal hearts (histology, mass, left ventricular end diastolic diameter [LVEDD], fractional shortening [FS]). Moreover, whereas Tnnt 2 (+/-) /TG(K 210 <b>Delta)</b> <b>mice</b> had severe DCM, TG(K 210 <b>Delta)</b> <b>mice</b> had only mild DCM (FS 18 +/- 4 vs. 29 +/- 7 %; p< 0. 01). The difference in severity of DCM may be attributable to a greater ratio of mutant to wildtype Tnnt 2 transcript in Tnnt 2 (+/-) /TG(K 210 Delta) relative to TG(K 210 <b>Delta)</b> <b>mice</b> (2. 42 +/- 0. 08, p = 0. 03). Tnnt 2 (+/-) /TG(K 210 Delta) muscle showed Ca(2 +) desensitization (pCa(50) = 5. 34 +/- 0. 08 vs. 5. 58 +/- 0. 03 at sarcomere length 1. 9 microm, p< 0. 01), but no difference in maximum force generation. Day 9. 5 Tnnt 2 (-/-) embryos had normally looped hearts, but thin ventricular walls, large pericardial effusions, noncontractile hearts, and severely disorganized sarcomeres. Absence of one Tnnt 2 allele leads to a mild deficit in transcript but not protein, leading to a normal cardiac phenotype. DCM results from abnormal function of a mutant protein, which is associated with myocyte Ca(2 +) desensitization. The severity of DCM depends on the ratio of mutant to wildtype Tnnt 2 transcript. cTnT is essential for sarcomere formation, but normal embryonic heart looping occurs without contractile activity...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{genotoxic}} chemicals at a {{young age}} increases cancer incidence later in life. Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is a potent genotoxin that induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in many animal species and in humans. Whereas adult mice are insensitive to aflatoxin-induced carcinogenesis, mice treated with AFB 1 shortly after birth develop a high incidence of HCC in adulthood. Furthermore, the incidence of HCC in adult male mice treated as infants is much greater than in females, reasons for which are unclear. In this study, treatment with AFB 1 produced similar levels of DNA damage and mutations in the liver of newborn male and female <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> B 6 C 3 F 1 mice. Twenty-four hours after dosing with AFB 1 (6 mg/kg), the highly mutagenic AFB 1 -FAPY adduct was present at twice the level of AFB 1 -N 7 -guanine in liver DNA of males and females. A multiple dose regimen (3 × 2 mg/kg), while delivering the same total dose, resulted in lower AFB 1 adduct levels. Mutation frequencies in the gpt transgene in liver were increased by 20 - to 30 -fold. The most prominent mutations in AFB 1 -treated mice were G:C to T:A transversions and G:C to A:T transitions. At this 21 -day time point, {{no significant differences were found}} in mutation frequency or types of mutations between males and females. These results show that infant male and female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice experience similar amounts of DNA damage and mutation from AFB 1 that may initiate the neoplastic process. The gender difference in the subsequent development of HCC highlights the importance of elucidating additional factors that modulate HCC development...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/+ <b>mice,</b> an animal model of spondylarthritis (SpA) with both gut and joint inflammation. Methods. The frequency and activation of iNKT cells were analyzed on mononuclear cells from the lymph nodes and livers of mice, using flow cytometry with alpha-galactosylceramide/CD 1 d tetramers and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the invariant V(alpha) 14 -J(alpha) 18 rearrangement. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were obtained by expansion of primary cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor followed by coculture with iNKT cell hybridomas, and interleukin- 2 release into the cocultures was then measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cytokine levels were determined by ELISA or cytometric bead array analyses of freshly isolated DCs and iNKT cells in mixed cocultures. TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/+ <b>mice</b> were backcrossed onto J(alpha) 18 (-/-) and CD 1 d(-/-) mice, and disease onset was evaluated by clinical scoring, positron emission tomography, and histology. CD 1 d levels were analyzed on mononuclear cells in paired blood and synovial fluid samples from patients with SpA compared with healthy control subjects. Results. In the absence of iNKT cells, symptoms of gut and joint inflammation in TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/+ <b>mice</b> were aggravated. Invariant NKT cells were activated {{during the course of}} the disease. This was linked to an enrichment of inflammatory DCs, characterized by high levels of CD 1 d, particularly at draining sites of inflammation. A similar increase in CD 1 d levels was observed on DCs from patients with SpA. Inflammatory DCs from TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/+ <b>mice</b> stimulated iNKT cells to produce immunomodulatory cytokines, in the absence of exogenous stimulation. Prolonged, continuous exposure, but not short-term exposure, to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was found to be responsible for the enhanced DC-NKT cell crosstalk. Conclusion. This mode of iNKT cell activation represents a natural counterregulatory mechanism for the dampening of TNF-driven inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils are {{multifunctional}} leukocytes {{implicated in}} numerous inflammatory diseases. The {{present study was}} conducted to clarify the precise role of eosinophils in the development of colitis by using eosinophil-depleted mice and a novel chemokine-binding protein that neutralizes CCL 11 action. Colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to wild-type and eosinophil-deficient <b>Delta</b> dblGATA- 1 <b>mice.</b> Accumulation of eosinophils in the gut of mice given DSS paralleled worsening of clinical score and weight loss. in response to DSS, <b>Delta</b> dblGATA- 1 <b>mice</b> showed virtual absence of eosinophil recruitment, amelioration of clinical score, weight loss, and tissue destruction, and no lethality. There was a decrease in CXCL 1 and CCL 3 production and decreased neutrophil influx in the intestine of <b>Delta</b> dblGATA- 1 <b>mice.</b> Transfer of bone marrow cells from wild-type mice reconstituted disease manifestation in DSS-treated <b>Delta</b> dblGATA- 1 <b>mice,</b> and levels of CCL 11 were increased after DSS treatment and localized to inflammatory cells. Treatment with the chemokine-binding protein evasin- 4 at a dose that prevented the function of CCL 11 greatly ameliorated clinical score, weight loss, overall tissue destruction, and death rates. In conclusion, the influx of eosinophils is critical for the induction of colitis by DSS. Treatment with a novel chemokine-binding protein decreased eosinophil influx and greatly ameliorated colitis, suggesting that strategies that interfere with the recruitment of eosinophils may be useful as therapy for colitis...|$|R
40|$|Ectodomain {{shedding}} of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR 1) provides {{negative feedback}} to the inflammatory loop induced by TNF alpha. As {{the significance of this}} mechanism in obesity-associated pathologies is unclear, we aimed to unravel how much TNFR 1 ectodomain shedding controls the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as its {{role in the development of}} insulin resistance. We used knockin mice expressing a mutated TNFR 1 ectodomain (p 55 Dns), incapable of shedding and dampen the inflammatory response. Our data show that persistent TNF alpha signaling through this inability of TNFR 1 ectodomain shedding contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation, which is confined to the liver. In spite of this, hepatic lipid levels were not affected by the nonshedding mutation in mice fed a chow diet, nor were they worse off following 12 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) than controls (p 55 (+/+)) fed an HFD. We detected inflammatory infiltrates, hepatocellular necrosis, and apoptosis in livers of p 55 (<b>Delta</b> ns/Delta ns) <b>mice</b> fed an HFD, suggesting advanced progression of NAFLD toward nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Indeed, fibrosis was present in p 55 (<b>Delta</b> ns/Delta ns) <b>mice,</b> but absent in wildtype mice, confirming that the p 55 (<b>Delta</b> ns/Delta ns) <b>mice</b> had a more severe NASH phenotype. Despite low-grade hepatic inflammation, insulin resistance was not observed in p 55 (<b>Delta</b> ns/Delta ns) <b>mice</b> fed a chow diet, and HFD-induced insulin resistance was no worse in p 55 (<b>Delta</b> ns/Delta ns) <b>mice</b> than p 55 (+/+) mice. Conclusion: TNFR 1 ectodomain shedding is not an essential feedback mechanism in preventing the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance. It is, however, pivotal in attenuating the progression from "simple steatosis" towards a more serious phenotype with many NASH features. Targeting TNFR 1 could therefore be beneficial in attenuating NASH. (HEPATOLOGY 2013; 57 : 566 - 576) ...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{is a human}} carcinogen, but the {{mechanisms}} evoked in carcinogenesis during this chronic inflammatory disease remain incompletely characterized. We determined whether chronic H. pylori infection induced mutations in the gastric mucosa {{of male and female}} <b>gpt</b> <b>delta</b> C 57 BL/ 6 mice infected for 6 or 12 mo. Point mutations were increased in females infected for 12 mo. The mutation frequency in this group was 1. 6 -fold higher than in uninfected mice of both sexes (P < 0. 05). A:T-to-G:C transitions and G:C-to-T:A transversions were 3. 8 and 2. 0 times, respectively, more frequent in this group than in controls. Both mutations are consistent with DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. No increase in the frequency of deletions was observed. Females had more severe gastric lesions than males at 6 mo postinfection (MPI; P < 0. 05), but this difference was absent at 12 MPI. In all mice, infection significantly increased expression of IFNγ, IL- 17, TNFα, and iNOS at 6 and 12 mo, as well as H. pylori–specific IgG 1 levels at 12 MPI (P < 0. 05) and IgG 2 c levels at 6 and 12 MPI (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001). At 12 MPI, IgG 2 c levels in infected females were higher than at 6 MPI (P < 0. 05) and also than those in infected males at 12 MPI (P < 0. 05). Intensity of responses was mediated by sex and duration of infection. Lower H. pylori colonization indicated a more robust host response in females than in males. Earlier onset of severe gastric lesions and proinflammatory, Th 1 -biased responses in female C 57 BL/ 6 mice may have promoted mutagenesis by exposing the stomach to prolonged oxidative stress.

40|$|Bile acids {{regulate}} {{the expression of}} intestinal bile acid transporters and are natural ligands for nuclear receptors controlling inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile acid transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile acid transporters apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and organic solute transporter a and (3 was analyzed in Caco- 2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, in ileal tissue of TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/WT <b>mice</b> and in inflamed ilea) biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/WT <b>mice</b> and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco- 2 cell monolayers to TNFa impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE/WT <b>mice</b> displayed altered ileal bile acid homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental colitis, we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Spondyloarthritides (SpA) are characterised by both {{peripheral}} and axial arthritis. The {{hallmarks of}} peripheral SpA are {{the development of}} enthesitis, most typically of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia, and new bone formation. This study was undertaken to unravel the mechanisms leading towards enthesitis and new bone formation in preclinical models of SpA. Results: First, we demonstrated that TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE <b>mice</b> show typical inflammatory features highly reminiscent of SpA. The first signs of inflammation were found at the entheses. Importantly, enthesitis occurred equally in {{the presence or absence}} of mature T and B cells, underscoring the importance of stromal cells. Hind limb unloading in TNF <b>Delta</b> ARE <b>mice</b> significantly suppressed inflammation of the Achilles tendon compared with weight bearing controls. Erk 1 / 2 signalling plays a crucial role in mechanotransduction-associated inflammation. Furthermore, new bone formation is strongly promoted at entheseal sites by biomechanical stress and correlates with the degree of inflammation. Conclusions: These findings provide a formal proof of the concept that mechanical strain drives both entheseal inflammation and new bone formation in SpA...|$|R
40|$|Dysfunction {{and loss}} of insulin-producing {{pancreatic}} beta cells represent hallmarks of diabetes mellitus. Here, we show that mice lacking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p 38 delta display improved glucose tolerance due to enhanced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Deletion of p 38 delta results in pronounced activation of protein kinase D (PKD), the latter of which we have identified as a pivotal regulator of stimulated insulin exocytosis. p 38 delta catalyzes an inhibitory phosphorylation of PKD 1, thereby attenuating stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, p 38 <b>delta</b> null <b>mice</b> are protected against high-fat-feeding-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress-mediated beta cell failure. Inhibition of PKD 1 reverses enhanced insulin secretion from p 38 delta-deficient islets and glucose tolerance in p 38 <b>delta</b> null <b>mice</b> {{as well as their}} susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the p 38 delta-PKD pathway integrates regulation of the insulin secretory capacity and survival of pancreatic beta cells, pointing to a pivotal role for this pathway in the development of overt diabetes mellitus...|$|R

The results show that alpha beta T-cell-deficient (alpha-/-) mice, when compared with wild-type control mice, have dramatically increased mortality rate and greater in vivo growth of MoPn. The alpha beta T-cell-deficient mice were as susceptible to MoPn infection as T- and B-lymphocyte-deficient (RAG- 1 -/-) mice. Moreover, both alpha beta T-cell-deficient and RAG- 1 mutant mice failed to mount delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to organism-specific challenge and showed undetectable interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by spleen cells upon in vitro organism-specific restimulation. In contrast, gamma <b>delta</b> T-cell-deficient <b>mice</b> exhibited intact DTH responses and their mortality rate and in vivo chlamydial growth were comparable to those in wild-type controls. More interestingly, gamma <b>delta</b> T-cell-deficient <b>mice</b> showed {{significantly higher levels of}} IFN-gamma production than did wild-type mice.

40|$|The Bel- 1 protein {{of human}} foamy virus (HFV) is a transactivator {{acting on the}} U 3 region of the long {{terminal}} repeat and on an internal promoter (IP) immediately upstream of the bel genes. An HFV transgene called delta gpe, containing both promoters and all bel genes, is expressed in {{the central nervous system}} and induces neurodegeneration in mice. To dissect the role of individual promoters and bel genes on transgene expression and neurotoxicity we generated transgenic mice with a construct termed pL-bel 1, which lacks the IP and the ancillary genes except bel- 1.

We have analyzed the properties of a delta F 508 CFTR mouse model, which we described recently. We show that the mRNA levels of mutant CFTR are normal in all tissues examined. Therefore the reduced mRNA levels reported in two similar models {{may be related to}} their intronic transcription units. Maturation of mutant CFTR was greatly reduced in freshly excised oviduct, compared with normal. Accumulation of mutant CFTR antigen in the apical region of jejunum crypt enterocytes was not observed, in contrast to normal mice. In cultured gallbladder epithelial cells from <b>delta</b> F 508 <b>mice,</b> CFTR chloride channel activity could be detected at only two percent of the normal frequency.

Although ENaC channels provide a major route for Na(+) absorption, the route of Cl(-) transport has been unclear. We applied a series of complementary approaches to define the role of Cl(-) transport in fluid clearance in the distal airspaces of the intact mouse lung, using wild-type and cystic fibrosis <b>Delta</b> F 508 <b>mice.</b> Initial studies in wild-type mice showed marked inhibition of fluid clearance by Cl(-) channel inhibitors and Cl(-) ion substitution, providing evidence for a transcellular route for Cl(-) transport. In response to cAMP stimulation by isoproterenol, clearance was inhibited by the CFTR inhibitor glibenclamide in both wild-type mice and the normal human lung. Although isoproterenol markedly increased fluid absorption in wild-type mice, there was no effect in <b>Delta</b> F 508 <b>mice.</b> Radioisotopic clearance studies done at 23 degrees C (to block active fluid absorption) showed approximately 20 % clearance of (22) Na in 30 min both without and with isoproterenol.
