5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed.

He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging respect for each other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency.

Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow.

Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does not smoke cigarettes, though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to Don in many ways.

Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Dr. Jeremiah Surd. A childhood {{fan of the}} original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's [...] "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something {{he had tried to}} integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, [...] "Jonny is crazy about his dad. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special." [...] Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: [...] " [...] {{is one of the few}} roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us." [...] A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for [...] "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an [...] "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E

[...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E
