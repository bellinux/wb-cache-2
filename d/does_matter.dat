[...] An account in a New York newspaper reported that the Pillar had been [...] lost {{in the destruction of}} the street, but it had sustained only minor damage, chiefly bullet marks on the column and statue itself—one shot is said to have taken off Nelson's nose.|$|E

[...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual...
