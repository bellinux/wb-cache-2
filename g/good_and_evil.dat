5|$|Scholars of {{religion}} Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng {{argued that the}} teachings of Buddhism challenge Augustine's view of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> proposing a dualism in which <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This {{is similar to the}} Manicheist account of good and evil– that the two are equal and in conflict– though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict. Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents {{in the form of the}} serpent's temptation.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as}} the player's was added.|$|E
5|$|Yama is {{aided by}} his {{minister}} Chitragupta, who maintains {{a record of}} all <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> actions of every living being. Yama-dhutas are also assigned the job of executing the punishments on sinners in the various hells.|$|E
50|$|This {{analysis}} of tolerance makes Budziszewski a sharp critic of contemporary liberal theories of toleration, which are commonly based on moral neutrality, on suspension of judgment about <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>evils.</b> Budziszewski insists {{that if we}} were to suspend judgment consistently, we could neither defend the practice of toleration, nor decide which bad things should be tolerated. The true foundation of toleration is not suspension of judgment, but better judgment, and not neutrality about <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>evils,</b> but deeper insight into them. Indeed, argues Budziszewski, the proponents of neutralist theories actually suspend judgment only selectively, using a facade of neutrality in order to smuggle their moral views into policy without having to defend them.|$|R

Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E

They develop a romantic relationship which goes awry after Wang discovers her true identity.

5|$|The War of Souls trilogy {{begins as}} a strange storm courses through Krynn, heralding the War of Souls.

40|$|T. M. Scanlon has {{cited the}} value of {{friendship}} in arguing against a teleological view of value which says that value inheres only in states of affairs and demands only that we promote it. This article argues that, whatever the teleological view s final merits, the case against it cannot {{be made on the}} basis of friendship. The view can capture Scanlon s claims about friendship if it holds, as it can consistently with its basic ideas, that (i) friendship is a higher-level good consisting in appropriate attitudes to other <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>evils</b> in a friend s life, (ii) these <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>evils</b> have agent-relative value, i. e. more value than similar states of strangers, and (iii) the attitudes constituting friendship have less value than their objects. Given these independently plausible claims, the teleological view can agree with Scanlon that, e. g., it is wrong to betray a friend in order to promote more friendships among other people. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evil</b> option. There are also <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evil</b> side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

5|$|The Smallville {{incarnation}} of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks {{a fine line between}} <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b> Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E
5|$|The {{story for}} The Battle for Middle-earth II {{is divided into}} <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evil</b> Campaigns. The Good Campaign focuses on Glorfindel, an Elf who is alerted to a planned attack on the Elven {{sanctuary}} of Rivendell. With help from the Dwarves and other Good forces, the Elves attempt to eliminate Sauron and his army to restore peace in Middle-earth. In the Evil Campaign, Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgûl to muster wild Goblins. With his army, Sauron moves forward with his plan to destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.|$|E
5|$|There is no ethical {{cohesion}} {{within the}} New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff {{argued that the}} central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.

5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
5|$|Dean's other {{dream is}} a major {{turning point in the}} character's storyline, after which he starts gaining self-respect and realizes that he truly wants to live. He begins the season with little self-worth, and the writers {{realized}} that this outlook stems from his father, John Winchester. Initially, they planned to have Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprise his role as John, who would browbeat Dean within the dreamscape. When they learned that Morgan was busy filming Watchmen, the writers instead found inspiration in the junkyard scene from the film Superman III, in which <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> versions of Superman confront one another. Kripke noted, however, that the conversation between the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
