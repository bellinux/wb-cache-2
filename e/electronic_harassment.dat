40|$|Abstract Differences between Traditional and Electronic Bullying amongst College Students by Leeland Dale Durst Fall 2011 This study {{examines}} the prevalence {{and impact of}} electronic and traditional bullying among college students. In this study eighty three {{men and women were}} surveyed in several sections of a large, lower-division psychology course at Central Washington University in the Pacific Northwest. The current {{study examines}} whether there are differences between electronic and traditional bullying among college students. Likert scale format and dichotomous questions are used to assess the students’ experiences of traditional and electronic bullying. In addition, open- ended questions in the survey addressed why students electronically bully. Results reveal high, statistically significant differences in occurrence for each context of bullying which are traditional, text-message, Internet and picture-phone. Significant differences were also found for each type of bullying consisting of five conditions which are physical, verbal, rumor, exclusion and secret exclusion. These findings may help in the establishment of treatments for psychological distress that may occur as a result of <b>electronic</b> intimidation and <b>harassment.</b> Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|People who {{describe}} themselves as undergoing <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment</b> have organized and campaign to stop the use of alleged psychotronic and other mind control weapons. These campaigns have received some support from public figures, including former U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who included a provision banning [...] "psychotronic weapons" [...] in a 2001 bill that was later dropped, and former Missouri State Representative Jim Guest.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>harassment,</b> or psychotronic torture, or {{electromagnetic}} torture is {{a conspiracy}} theory that government agents {{make use of}} electromagnetic radiation (such as the microwave auditory effect), radar, and surveillance techniques to transmit sounds and thoughts into people's heads, affect people's bodies, and harass people. [...] Individuals who claim to experience this call themselves [...] "targeted individuals" [...] and many have joined support and advocacy groups.|$|E
5000|$|Press {{accounts}} {{have documented}} individuals who apparently {{believed they were}} victims of <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment,</b> {{and in some cases}} persuaded courts to agree. In 2008, James Walbert went to court claiming that his former business associate had threatened him with [...] "jolts of radiation" [...] after a disagreement, and later claimed feeling symptoms such as electric shock sensations, and hearing generated tones and other strange sounds in his ears. The court decided to issue an order banning [...] "electronic means" [...] to further harass Walbert.|$|E
5000|$|News {{reports have}} {{described}} how groups of Internet users have cooperated to exchange detailed conspiracy theories involving coordinated activities by {{large numbers of}} people called [...] "gang stalking". [...] The activities involved are described as involving <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment,</b> the use of [...] "psychotronic weapons", and other alleged mind control techniques. These have been reported by external observers as being examples of belief systems, as opposed to reports of objective phenomena. Some psychiatrists and psychologists say [...] "Web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking" [...] are [...] "an extreme community that may encourage delusional thinking" [...] and represent [...] "a dark side of social networking. They may reinforce the troubled thinking of the mentally ill and impede treatment." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{experiences}} {{of people who}} describe themselves as undergoing <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment</b> using esoteric technology, and who call themselves [...] "Targeted Individuals" [...] ("T.I.") varies, but includes hearing voices in their heads calling them by name, often mocking them or others around them, {{as well as physical}} sensations like burning. [...] They have also described being under physical surveillance by one or more people. [...] Many of these people act and function otherwise normally and included among them are people who are successful in their careers and lives otherwise, and who find these experiences confusing, upsetting, and sometimes shameful, but entirely real. [...] They use news stories, military journals and declassified national security documents to support their allegations that governments have developed technology that can send voices into people's heads and cause them to feel things.|$|E
5000|$|Arntfield {{currently}} holds a Canadian federal {{research grant}} {{to study the}} sociolinguistic underpinnings of cyberbullying, trolling, {{and other forms of}} cyberdeviance and <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment.</b> Having collected over 40,000 samples of cyberbullying text from news message board and social media sites and analyzing their contents, Arntfield has published a number of peer-reviewed journal articles and research papers appearing in textbooks in which he argues that cyberdeviance in many cases has a distinct sexual and fantasy-based component. He argues that cyberbullying and acts of trolling should therefore be understood as being more akin to a paraphilia than traditional physical bullying.In 2016, Arntfield will serve as the visiting Fulbright Research Chair in crime and literature at the English department at Vanderbilt University after being selected as part of a rigorously competitive process overseen by the U.S. Department of State. He will be furthering his research on literary criminology and cyberbullying while there, as well as developing a Vanderbilt iteration of his Cold Case Society. He will return to Western in the fall of 2016.|$|E

40|$|M. A. South African {{society is}} {{experiencing}} {{high levels of}} violence against women. Various research studies have been conducted in South Africa and at international universities: they all indicate the presence of violence on campus. The researcher used a quantitative approach to gather information on students‟ perceptions of sexual violence and focused on gender differences and similarities. Both undergraduate and postgraduate students living in residence were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Significant findings of the study are that sexual harassment was rampant on this campus. In addition, there are gender differences in the perception of sexual harassment. Both genders agreed that direct, physical violence and <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment</b> both constitute sexual harassment. However, men and women did not agree that non-violent behaviour constitutes sexual harassment. It is noteworthy that some men reported having experienced non-violent forms of sexual harassment. The study established that rape was not common on this campus. Moreover, different forms of non-violent sexual harassment were widespread and that more women than men experienced various forms of sexual harassment on campus. Both male and females perpetrate sexual harassment. However, perpetrators were predominantly male with a significant number being students, academic and non-academic staff members. The majority of students were not aware of the procedure to follow if sexually harassed on campus and were unaware of the universitiy's sexual harassment policy. Males and females preferred talking to a friend about their sexual harassment and seldom used university resources. Sexual harassment occurred all over campus and the researcher strongly recommend that university management commit themselves to dealing with sexual harassment by clearly stating that sexual harassment is not tolerated on campus and introducing measures to address this problem...|$|E
40|$|With all of {{its many}} {{benefits}} to humanity, one {{of the consequences of}} the Internet age is a far more pervasive and potentially damaging version of bullying called cyberbullying, which can also be referred to as ebullying, electronic bullying, cyberviolence, digital bullying, <b>electronic</b> <b>harassment,</b> and online harassment. Cyberbullying is being cruel to others by sending or posting harmful material or engaging in other forms of social cruelty using digital technologies. Because most children and young adults are computer literate and have access to a range of digital communication tools, cyberbullying has the potential to have more severe consequences than traditional bullying. This potential means that schools must find comprehensive approaches to combat the effects of cyberbullying, as it also undermines school climate and the safe and supportive environment that fosters student learning. The purpose of this research study was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the differing perceptions of cyberbullying based on the views of students, parents, educators, and school administrators. An Internet survey was used to gather information from groups of students, parents, and school staff of varying age groups, backgrounds, and locations. It was adapted from previously conducted surveys with several questions added for this specific project (Hinduja et al., 2009; Rogers, 2010; Trolley & Hanel, 2010; Willard, 2007 b). The results of the study indicated that the perceptions of students, parents, educators, and administrators varied significantly in many issues. The most significant variations between subgroups occurred when looking at students’ willingness to talk to any adult when they or others are being cyberbullied. Another significant variation was seen between administrators and the other subgroups when looking at training of all stakeholders pertaining to cyberbullying and a school staff’s ability to identify and appropriately address cyberbullying. Results indicated that even school staff seemed to be in the dark about what, if any, policy or process their school district had in place to handle cyberbullying. As authority figures who are in the trenches with the students day after day, educators might have a better handle even than parents on students’ school personae, social hierarchies, and the ever-changing affiliations that bloom and wilt before their eyes in classrooms and hallways. This makes it imperative that they know what is in place to help them take care of their students and help keep the school environment safe.
