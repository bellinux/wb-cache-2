25|$|Abernethy {{was ousted}} from AMC on January 9, 1967 and damage control {{fell to the}} new CEO, Roy D. Chapin Jr. (son of Hudson Motors founder Roy D. Chapin). Chapin quickly instituted changes to AMC's offerings and tried to regain market share by {{focusing}} on younger demographic markets. Chapin's first decision was to cut {{the price of the}} Rambler to within US$200 of the basic Volkswagen Beetle. Innovative marketing ideas included making air conditioning standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a <b>delete</b> <b>option).</b> This made AMC the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as Lincoln, Imperial, and Cadillac.|$|E
500|$|Holden's {{emphasis}} on fuel economy extended beyond powertrains, with a fuel consumption vacuum gauge replacing the tachometer throughout the range, although {{this could be}} optioned back with the sports instrumentation package. Visual changes were limited: the relocation of the corporate crest to {{the centre of the}} redesigned grille, black-coloured trim applied to the tail lamp surrounds on sedans, and the embossment of model badging into the side rubbing strips. The previously undesignated base car, was now the Commodore L, opening up the range for a new unbadged sub-level car. This <b>delete</b> <b>option</b> model, was de-specified and available only to fleet customers. On the premium Commodore SL/E, a resurrected [...] "Shadowtone" [...] exterior paint option became available in a limited range of dark-over-light colour combinations. According to contemporary reviews, changes made to the VC's steering produced a heavier feel and inclined understeer, while the revised suspension gave a softer ride and addressed concerns raised while riding fully laden.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} engine on both models was AMC's 3.8L inline-6, {{with the}} 2.5L I4, and 4.2L I6 optional, while the 5.0L AMC V8 engine was offered {{as an option}} only on the liftback. The 1979 model year would mark a (one-year) reprisal for 5.0L V8 availability in the short [...] wheelbase AMC chassis. The last time the two were available together was in the 1976 Gremlin. The four, sixes, and V8 could be mated to either a standard 4-speed manual transmission or an optional 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission with floor shift, depending on trim and options. A 3-speed manual transmission was only available as a <b>delete</b> <b>option</b> on the sixes.|$|E

50|$|In {{educational}} testing, {{the process}} of elimination {{is a process of}} <b>deleting</b> <b>options</b> whereby the possibility of an option being correct is close to zero or significantly lower compared to other options. The process does not guarantee success, even if only 1 option remains.|$|R

50|$|Both the Cutlass Supreme and Calais were {{available}} with T-tops or a factory sunroof, {{even on the}} base Cutlass Supreme coupe with the factory radio <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
5000|$|All GCC-Spec {{vehicles}} were fitted with the High Ambient Temperature and Speed Package, heavy-duty battery, and an auxiliary transmission fluid cooler. Prior to 2002, export vehicles included a catalytic converter <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b> All standard-wheelbase examples were fitted with true dual exhaust.|$|E
50|$|As before, the 5.0L V8 was {{not offered}} above 8500 GVWR and the F-Superduty was 7.5 and diesel only. The diesels and 7.5 were above 8500 GVWR only (F250HD and heavier.) The 4.9 was {{available}} in the F350 through 1996 as a <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the newly}} {{established}} Ford SVT division, the 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra was offered with the 302 cuin L V8 that produced [...] and [...] of torque. Featuring more subdued styling than the GT, the Cobra used Ford's new GT-40 high-performance engine equipment. A Cobra R model was also produced for 1993 that used the same engine as the regular Cobra. It featured larger brakes, Koni shocks and struts, engine oil cooler, power steering cooler, and rear seat <b>delete.</b> <b>Options</b> such as air conditioning and a stereo system were not available on the Cobra R.|$|R

30|$|However, Budescu and Nevo ([1985]), in a partly {{theoretical}} and partly empirical study, attacked {{the assumption of}} proportionality based on recording the time taken to complete tests using different option format items. From a 5 -option university entrance examination of English vocabulary and reading, verbal reasoning and mathematics, they created 4 -, 3 - and 2 -option versions by successively <b>deleting</b> <b>options.</b> Using a group of 1000 Israeli subjects {{they found that the}} 2 -option version of the test was easiest and least reliable with the difficulty of the formats increasing with the number of options, and concluded that the optimum number of options was greater than three.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, {{the engines}} offered were [...] and [...] The Scooter {{hatchback}} included a rear seat, while offering a rear seat <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b> The Sandpiper trim package included a “reef” patterned interior, deluxe door trim, cream gold or antique white exterior colors and an exterior Sandpiper logo just behind each door.|$|E
50|$|Another popular {{cosmetic}} upgrade {{were the}} AMG body kits. These ranged from subtle front spoilers, to an aggressive Wide Body kits for the W126 coupes. Other options included Recaro seats, smaller diameter steering wheels, instrument clusters, chrome <b>delete</b> <b>option</b> (all brightworks colour-coded or painted satin black), refrigerators, shift knobs, hi-fi stereo systems, custom upholstery and enhanced interior wood packages.|$|E
5000|$|Late in the 1980 model year, Ford {{began to}} offer the Thunderbird with a six-cylinder engine for the first time. [...] Technically a <b>delete</b> <b>option,</b> the Thunderbird was now {{available}} with an 88 hp 200 cubic-inch inline-six sourced from the Fairmont/Granada; it was paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission. This would also be {{the last year for}} the 302 V8.|$|E
50|$|The Metaphor {{workstation}} had {{a wireless}} keyboard, wireless mouse, wireless numeric pad, and a wireless 5-function keypad. All these input devices docked in the desktop workstation {{where they were}} recharged. Objects on the desktop and open applications had a uniform command set that could be controlled by the keypad which had Copy, Move, <b>Delete,</b> <b>Options,</b> and Size. Workstations were connected with Ethernet. The industrial design of the workstation was done by Mike Nutall of Matrix Product Design. It {{won a gold medal}} from the IDSA. The workstation itself was engineered by James Yurchenco at David Kelley Design. Both Matrix and David Kelley Design were precursors of IDEO.|$|R
5000|$|The HT Monaro can be {{distinguished}} from the HK by the adoption of plastic grilles (previously metal), a round speedometer instead of [...] "strip" [...] style allowing for bringing the tachometer into the main instrument cluster {{instead of on the}} floor console, rubber front suspension bushes instead of the HK's sintered bronze, and larger taillights where the turn indicators also wrapped around the now slightly undercut edges. Bodywork 'go-faster' stripe designs (<b>delete</b> <b>options)</b> varied for each series; HK stripes were offset to the driver's side of the bonnet (hood) and bootlid (trunk), the HT had two broad stripes down the centre of the car. HT also had twin air scoops / vents incorporated into their bonnet, which served no real purpose in delivering air into the engine bay.|$|R
50|$|The LTD FC {{series was}} updated to and {{designated}} FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine <b>option</b> <b>deleted</b> the following year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{base engine}} was a 4.2 L (255 cu in V8), or an {{optional}} [...] 5.0 L (302 cu in) Windsor V8. A 3.3 L I6 was {{offered as a}} <b>delete</b> <b>option</b> in late built 1980 models and became the standard powerplant in 1981. The 3.8 L V6 was made available as an option in 1982, and the 302 cuin L Windsor 5.0 V8 was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|... 1992: The Town & Country was {{available}} with all-wheel drive and integrated child safety seats. Now standard were a driver's side airbag (from August 1991 production) and quad command bucket seating. On the exterior, the Town & Country {{was available}} with a vinyl woodgrain <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b> If buyers opted for this, the woodgrain siding {{was replaced by}} a gold pinstripe along the beltline. New gold web-design alloy wheels were available.|$|E
50|$|Trim {{levels for}} the second {{generation}} Acadia were carried over from the previous generation; SL, SLE-1, SLE-2, SLT-1, SLT-2, {{as well as a}} Denali trim level, though an All-Terrain Package is available on Acadia SLE and SLT trim levels that will be more rugged in its appearance. The second generation Acadia is also available with Third Row Seat <b>Delete</b> <b>option</b> on SLE and SLT trim levels as part of the All-Terrain Package.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{personalized}} two pass statistical approach that employs existing advance fee spam corpus and personalized filtering {{with support from}} the users to bring down the rates of advance fee fraud spam mails flooding electronic e-mails. The system works in tandem with corpus supplied to it and users classification or behaviour towards spam mails. The framework also provides users with two <b>delete</b> <b>options</b> in their inboxes i. e. delete (normal deletion of good mails), delete as spam (delete a misclassified mail to ensure the system learns from it). For the spam corpus, there is also delete (deletion showing spam mails are unwanted). We also propose the implementation an important feature which most often is neglected by spam filter developers – that is – being able to reclassify spam mails that contains important information. We expect that the overall implementation of the system will assist in addressing the problem of accurately classifying advance fee fraud e-mails...|$|R

50|$|An {{equivalent}} way {{to express}} LIIA {{is that if a}} subset of the options are in consecutive positions in the order of finish, then their relative order of finish must not change if all other <b>options</b> are <b>deleted</b> from the votes. For example, if all options except those in 3rd, 4th and 5th place are <b>deleted,</b> the <b>option</b> that finished 3rd must win, the 4th must finish second, and 5th must finish 3rd.|$|R
50|$|In January 2012, Ford {{announced}} that the formerly automatic-only Titanium model would be offered with a manual transmission. In March 2012, Ford revised the ordering guide for the Titanium models to also have a MyFord Touch <b>delete</b> <b>option,</b> replacing it with the non-touch version of MyFord. Although MyFord Touch is an $995 option on SEL models and the PowerShift automatic a $1095 option on S and SE, no discount is applied to either manual or non-Touch Titanium models.|$|E
50|$|This second {{series was}} sold in {{parallel}} with the AU II series Falcon of 2000-2001, which benefitted from structural and interior upgrades. The TE50, for example, could now be had with the previous car's suede-velour interior or a new leather trim with either red or blue inserts and embroidered logos, matched to the Momo steering wheel, gear knob and door trim. In addition, bumper inserts, rear wing and multi-colour interiors were a <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b> For the first time, these models could also be optioned with satellite navigation.|$|E
50|$|The initial cars {{included}} features that, {{although they}} made the Cosworth a more effective car, did not enhance it as a road vehicle, and once the rules were satisfied Ford attempted to make the car less temperamental and easier to drive under normal conditions. The second generation, starting production from late 1994, were fitted with a Garrett T25 turbocharger, a smaller unit which reduced turbo lag and increased usability in everyday driving situations. With these later models, the 'whale tail' spoiler became a <b>delete</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis of {{dementia}} {{in primary care}} is both difficult and important. The recommendations by several authors to improve the diagnosis {{of dementia}} by general practitioners are important, but insufficient. It is argued that perhaps the disease concept in itself is a cause of confusion for clinicians. Primary care physicians need an adapted procedure, gradually leading to the final diagnosis of dementia. It {{has to be a}} stepwise labelling strategy, using global descriptions and non-disease specific labels in the beginning, ending up with well-defined disease criteria. In this process, there is circularity: previous diagnoses have to be kept in mind because symptoms and signs may gradually change during the progression of the disease, leading to reconsideration of previous <b>deleted</b> <b>options.</b> To frame this properly, the primary care physician needs to adopt a broad "frail elderly" geriatric concept. Implementation of this concept not only helps the diagnostic process, but also stimulates the care for dementing patients and their caregivers. Relevant arguments for early diagnostic involvement of primary care physicians can be put forward on condition that a new concept, adapted procedures and adapted instruments are used. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Released on 26 July 1970, the HG Monaro was {{the last}} of the {{original}} coupé design concept. HG had cleaner lines with brightwork reduced and some re-designed. The HG sported different striping (<b>delete</b> <b>options)</b> which were known as [...] "sidewinder" [...] stripes which ran along the top edge of the fenders, under the windows and finishing just before the rear pillar. The [...] "Monaro" [...] badge on both rear pillars was introduced to all models. For the HG GTS, the [...] "GTS" [...] badges now featured black paint fill, received new black-out paint on rocker panels, with the GTS 350 getting bold treatment with new [...] "sidewinder" [...] stripes and bonnet scoop black-outs. [...] "GTS 350" [...] designations now featured gutsier decals on the fenders and boot lid. Wheel arch moldings were deleted on all models. The [...] "GTS 350" [...] models no longer had the 350 Chevrolet badge on the fender, but rather a bold decal stating [...] "350" [...] as well as blackouts that covered the air-vents on the bonnet. The GTS badge originally above the gills in the fenders would be removed and would now be black instead of red (with the badges being placed on the passenger side of the grille and boot). The taillights had a cleaner look and the grille was redesigned.|$|R
2500|$|For 1988, {{changes for}} the Troféo {{included}} new seats and monochromatic paint; both Toronado and Troféo benefitted from larger climate control buttons and rear three-point seatbelts. Additionally, power increased {{with the introduction of}} the new Buick [...] LN3 V6 engine. Wire wheelcovers were <b>deleted</b> from the <b>options</b> sheet. Other changes were minor and mainly cosmetic.|$|R
50|$|The Lincoln Navigator {{included}} standard features available or optional on the Expedition, including {{power driver}} and passenger bucket seats, 2nd-row bucket seats (with a 2nd-row bench seat as a <b>delete</b> <b>option),</b> floor consoles, and keyless entry. The few options available included a power moonroof, a universal garage door opener, 7 seven to 8 eight passenger seating an electrochromic rearview mirror (filtering out headlight glare from vehicles {{seen in the}} mirror), and a premium audio system (a seven speaker, 290-Watt audio system with a 6-disc front console-mounted CD-changer, and rear seat audio controls), and 17-inch alloy wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} W202 [...] "Baby Benz" [...] came {{standard in}} Germany with a four-speed manual transmission, with five-speed manual and four-speed automatic transmissions optional. In the United States, automatic transmission was standard, with manual {{available as a}} <b>delete</b> <b>option</b> (with few choosing to do so). The four-speed automatic was the 722.4 version of the 4G-Tronic. In 1996, this old transmission—released in 1981—was replaced by a five-speed automatic, the 722.6 or 5G-Tronic, which received a manual shift mode in 1999 (722.6). In 2000, with the T-Model only remaining on sale, the RWD C 240 was available with the optional six-speed G56 manual from the W203.|$|E
50|$|Abernethy {{was ousted}} from AMC on January 9, 1967 and damage control {{fell to the}} new CEO, Roy D. Chapin Jr. (son of Hudson Motors founder Roy D. Chapin). Chapin quickly instituted changes to AMC's offerings and tried to regain market share by {{focusing}} on younger demographic markets. Chapin's first decision was to cut {{the price of the}} Rambler to within US$200 of the basic Volkswagen Beetle. Innovative marketing ideas included making air conditioning standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a <b>delete</b> <b>option).</b> This made AMC the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as Lincoln, Imperial, and Cadillac.|$|E

Initial functionality was designed to sort partition table entries caused by effects of disk imaging, but quickly evolved to include the backup and recovery of the entire MBR, repair of a corrupt Windows MBR record, as well as direct modification of the disk signature. Additional functionality was added to allow partitions to be activated, hidden, and <b>deleted.</b> Later <b>options</b> were added to include disk wipe functionality, shutdown/reboot of the machine, mount/dismount of Windows volumes, and a staging byte utilized to maintain status between reboots.|$|R

40|$|Research on prescreening {{processes}} {{in decision making}} was extended by manipulating task valence {{in a series of}} three experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, half the subjects had the "positive " task of screening and then selecting someone to hire for a job and half had the "negative " task of screening and then selecting someone to fire, where the choice options (worker descriptions) were the same in each task. In Experiment 1 some subjects were instructed to list options they would include for further consideration and some were instructed to list options they would exclude from further consideration. More options were screened out in the inclusion condition than in the exclusion condition and in the firing task than in the hiring task. Subjects in Experiment 2 were allowed to decide for themselves whether to use inclusion or exclusion in screening options. The main results from Experiment 1 were replicated. Also, subjects in the hiring task were more likely than subjects in the firing task to select inclusion as a strategy for prescreening options. In Experiment 3 the positive task involved adding stocks to a portfolio following an unexpected financial gain and the negative task involved disposing of stocks following a financial setback. Again, more options were screened out by subjects selecting the inclusion strategy than by exclusion subjects, but differences between the positive and negative tasks were not found. Results were explained in terms of a "status quo " bias for adding or <b>deleting</b> <b>options</b> that transcends task differences and a positivity bias in judging people that distinguishes judgments in different task domains...|$|R
