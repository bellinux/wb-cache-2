5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
25|$|We {{were in the}} {{universe}} of the teenage movie. Teenage reality. So we said here’s what’s going to be weird about the world of our movie: No one’s {{going to be over}} 30. The world is a high school, essentially. And Tom Cody will be the football hero. And Willem Dafoe is the greaser. Remember: You had John Hughes at the time, and then you had Coppola making two high school movies: The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. So Walter said we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> high school movie that’s also going to be a comic book and also going to be a musical.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

500|$|In 1928 Olivier {{created the}} role of Stanhope in R.C. Sherriff's Journey's End, in which he scored a great success at its single Sunday night premiere. He was offered the part in the West End {{production}} the following year, but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of Beau Geste in a stage adaptation of P. C. Wren's 1929 novel of the same name. Journey's End became a long-running success; Beau Geste failed. The Manchester Guardian commented, [...] "Mr.Laurence Olivier did his best as Beau, but he deserves and will get better parts. Mr.Olivier is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> big name for himself". For the rest of 1929 Olivier appeared in seven plays, {{all of which were}} short-lived.

500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue.
