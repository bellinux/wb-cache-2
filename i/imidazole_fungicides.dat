The use of TDZ (0. 25 - 1 muM) in ovary cultures of Spathiphyllum was required. On the contrary, cytokinins were not crucial during ovule culture; in fact, {{the use of a}} too high TDZ concentration induced diploid parthenogenesis in ovules of `Alfa'. The use of the <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> IMA, PRO or TRI during ovary culture was not critical, though they enhanced the swelling of ovules during ovary culture, making the isolation of the ovules easier. The ovule cultures yielded different plantlets. Flow cytometry and AFLP-patterns showed that two doubled haploid genotypes could be obtained from `Stefanie'. These plants showed a normal phenotype. We concluded that the induction of homozygous Spathiphyllum through gynogenesis is possible and is genotype dependent...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of critical sites {{of interaction between}} pollutants and fish is a major means of investigation {{in order to obtain}} early advance {{knowledge of}} adverse alterations and ecotoxicological risks. In fish, the ovarian secretion of oestradiol- 17 beta has been demonstrated to govern hepatic synthesis of vitellogenin, a lipoprotein corresponding to the major part of embryonic trophic reserves. Oestradiol synthesis is catalysed by aromatase, a cytochrome P 450 -dependent enzymatic activity. Effects of different <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicides,</b> well known as potent inhibitors of cytochrome P 450 s, were tested in vitro. A concentration-dependent inhibition of the microsomal aromatase was observed with an inhibiting potency order as follows: clotrimazole (Inhibition 50 %: 5. 10 (- 7) m) > prochloraz and imazalil (I 50 %: 5. 10 (- 6) M) > ketoconazole (I 50 %: 5. 10 (- 4)).

40|$|International audienceAromatase, a key steroidogenic {{enzyme that}} catalyses the {{conversion}} of androgens to estrogens, represent a target for endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of pollutants on aromatase enzymes in fish. In this study, we first optimized a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) microsomal aromatase assay to measure the effects of 43 substances belonging to diverse chemical classes (steroidal and non steroidal aromatase inhibitors, pesticides, heavy metals, organotin compounds, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) on brain and ovarian aromatase activities in vitro. Our results showed that 12 compounds were able to inhibit brain and ovarian aromatase activities in a dose-dependent manner with IC 50 values ranging from the low nM to the high uM range depending on the substance: steroidal and non steroidal inhibitors of aromatase (4 -hydroxyandrostenedione, androstatrienedione, aminogluthethimide), <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> (clotrimazole, imazalil, prochloraz), triazole fungicides (difenoconazole, fenbuconazole, propiconazole, triadimenol), the pyrimidine fungicide fenarimol and methylmercury. Overall, this study demonstrates that rainbow trout brain and ovarian microsomal aromatase assay is suitable for evaluating potential aromatase inhibitors in vitro notably with respect to environmental screening. The results highlight that methylmercury and some pesticides that are currently used throughout the world, have the potential to interfere with the biosynthesis of endogenous estrogens in fish...|$|E

Similarly to other azole fungicides, prochloraz is an inhibitor of the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1), which is necessary for the production of ergosterol - an essential component of the fungal cell membrane - from lanosterol. The agent is a broad-spectrum, protective and curative fungicide, effective against Alternaria spp., Botrytis spp., Erysiphe spp., Helminthosporium spp., Fusarium spp., Pseudocerosporella spp., Pyrenophora spp., Rhynchosporium spp., and Septoria spp.|$|R
40|$|Pyrodwarf, low {{vigorous}} pear rootstock {{was used}} as a model plant in these investigations. Under the in vitro conditions, successful micropropagation of this genotype is largely based on the nodal transplantation of shoots due to low potential of lateral shoots to form. Therefore, the objective of these investigations was to study the influence of <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> Prochloraz on the multiplication. The commercial chemical SPORTAK 45 -E- 450, which contains active substance Prochloraz (N-propyl-N-[2 -(2, 4, 6 -trichlorphenoxy) -ethyl]imidazole- 1 -carboxamide), {{was used as}} the source of the <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide.</b> The experiment was performed during the multiplication phase, and it involved the study of 19 types of media which included MS macro and micro salts, different prochloraz concentrations, BAP, IBA and GA 3. Prochloraz involved 3 concentrations (1, 5 and 10 µM), either individually or combined with BAP (4. 4 µM), IBA (5 µM) and GA 3 (0. 3 µM). Upon the second subcultures, the parameters of the shoot multiplication, multiplication index and the length and the number of leaves on axial and lateral shoots were determined. Fresh and dry shoot weight, i. e. callus, stem and leaves were also checked. The highest multiplication index (1 : 2. 72) was obtained at the medium which contained 10 µM of prochloraz combined with 4. 4 µM BAP and 0. 3 µM GA 3, individual multiplication index being even up to 1 : 6. Individual or IBA combined application of fungicides affected the shoot rooting of the Pyrodwarf (up to 100 %).

40|$|The {{benzimidazole}} fungicides thiabendazole and carbendazim, and the <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> prochloraz-Mn, {{were tested}} for their efficacy in controlling cobweb disease of mushrooms caused by two Cladobotryum isolates. Isolate 202 A was benzimidazole-sensitive in vitro and cobweb growth on the casing was well controlled by both benzimidazole fungicides in cropping experiments. Carbendazim also controlled {{the development of}} spotting symptoms much more effectively than thiabendazole. A second isolate (192131) was benzimidazole-resistant and was highly resistant to thiabendazole in vitro but it showed some sensitivity to carbendazim in vitro at moderate to high concentrations. Despite this, carbendazim did not control disease symptoms in cropping experiments, confirming that isolate 192 B 1 is cross-resistant to other benzimidazole fungicides. Both isolates showed some sensitivity to prochloraz-Mn in vitro. This fungicide gave between 45 % and 65 % control of cobweb growth on the casing caused by either 202 A or 192 B 1 but gave no control of spotting symptoms. Reducing the fungicide application volume did not give enhanced disease control. The emergence of benzimidazole resistance reduces the value of benzimidazoles in the control of mushroom pathogens. However, the lack of effective alternatives means they continue to have utility in cases where pathogens are still sensitive but this requires regular monitoring of pathogen populations for resistance.

40|$|Background: Triflumizole (TFZ) is an <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> used on many {{food and}} {{ornamental}} crops. TFZ is not {{thought to be}} particularly toxic or carcinogenic, but {{little is known about}} its effect on development. TFZ is identified as a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activator in ToxCast. Because PPARγ is a master regulator of adipogenesis, we hypothesized that TFZ would activate PPARγ, thereby inducing adipogenesis and weight gain in vivo. Objectives: We sought to test the ability of TFZ to activate PPARγ and promote adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We used transient transfection to test the ability of TFZ to activate PPARγ, and we used 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes and human multipotent mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) to study the adipogenic capacity of TFZ in culture. We treated pregnant mice with three doses of TFZ and evaluated the effects on body weight, adipose depot weight, and MSC programming in the prenatally exposed offspring. Discussion: TFZ induced adipogenesis in MSCs and in mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Prenatal exposure to levels of TFZ at approximately 400 -fold below the reported no observed adverse effect level increased adipose depot weight. All doses of TFZ tested increased adipogenic gene expression in MSCs while inhibiting expression of osteogenic genes. Conclusions: TFZ acts through a PPARγ-dependent mechanism to induce adipogenic differentiation in MSCs and preadipocytes at low nanomolar concentrations. Prenatal TFZ exposure increases adipose depot weight and diverts MSC fate toward the adipocyte lineage; therefore, we conclude that TFZ is an obesogen in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms by}} which environmental pollutants including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or widely used <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> prochloraz display their toxic effects in vertebrates is still not well understood. Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites termed dioxin response elements (DREs) in the 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) of efflux transporter ABCG 2 (Accession No. EU 570105) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and prochloraz, we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG 2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. TCDD or prochloraz doubled ABCG 2 -mediated Hoechst H 33342 secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG 2 inhibitor Ko 143. In further mechanistic studies we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG 2 5 -UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicylamide. Induction of AhR by TCDD and prochloraz resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of ABCG 2 gene expression and transporter protein levels. As ABCG 2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk. Through identification of mammary ABCG 2 as a novel target gene of pesticide prochloraz and dioxin our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast-feeding infants and the consumer of dairy product...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we aimed at characterizing {{the effect of}} prochloraz, an <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide,</b> on the oocyte meiotic {{maturation}} process in a freshwater teleost species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Full-grown post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), {{or a combination of}} prochloraz and LH. The occurrence of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after 62 -h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of prochloraz on the production of 17, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17, 20 beta P), the natural maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the effect of prochloraz on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time PCR. Prochloraz (10 (- 5) M) administered alone was able to induce 100 % GVBD in the most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after prochloraz stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17, 20 beta P production by the ovarian follicle. Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17, 20 beta P production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory follicular differentiation such as igf, igf 2, connexin 43, and 20 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsbd 20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH. Finally, our results clearly indicate that the effects of prochloraz and LH on oocyte maturation are synergistic...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} {{chemicals}} {{found in the}} aquatic environment {{have the potential to}} influence endocrine function and affect sexual development by mimicking or antagonizing the effects of hormones, or by altering the synthesis and metabolism of hormones. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the effects of chemicals interfering with sex hormone synthesis may affect the regulation of early ovarian development via the modulation of sex steroid and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) systems. To this end, ex vivo ovary cultures of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) were exposed for 2 days to either 1, 4, 6 -androstatriene- 3, 17 -dione (ATD, a specific aromatase inhibitor), prochloraz (an <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide),</b> or tributyltin (TBT, a persistent organic pollutant). Further, juvenile female brown trout were exposed in vivo for 2 days to prochloraz or TBT. The ex vivo and in vivo ovarian gene expression of the aromatase (CYP 19), responsible for estrogen production, and of IGF 1 and 2 were compared. Moreover, 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and testosterone (T) production from ex vivo ovary cultures was assessed. Ex vivo exposure to ATD inhibited ovarian E 2 synthesis, while T levels accumulated. However, ATD did not affect ex vivo expression of cyp 19, igf 1, or igf 2. Ex vivo exposure to prochloraz inhibited ovarian E 2 production, but did not affect T levels. Further prochloraz up-regulated igf 1 expression in both ex vivo and in vivo exposures. TBT exposure did not modify ex vivo synthesis of either E 2 or T. However, in vivo exposure to TBT down-regulated igf 2 expression. The results indicate that ovarian inhibition of E 2 production in juvenile brown trout might not directly affect cyp 19 and igf gene expression. Thus, we suggest that the test chemicals may interfere with both sex steroid and IGF systems in an independent manner, and based on published literature, potentially lead to endocrine dysfunction and altered sexual development...|$|R
40|$|Some {{chemicals}} are ligands to efflux transporters which {{may result in}} high concentrations in milk. Limited knowledge {{is available on the}} influence of maternal exposure to chemicals on the expression and function of transporters in the lactating mammary gland. We determined gene expression of ABC and SLC transporters in murine mammary tissue of different gestation and lactation stages, in murine mammary cells (HC 11) featuring resting and secreting phenotypes and in bovine mammary tissue and cells (BME-UV). Effects on transporter expression and function of the <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> prochloraz, previously reported to influence BCRP in mammary cells, was investigated on transporter expression and function in the two cell lines. Transporters studied were BCRP, MDR 1, MRP 1, OATP 1 A 5 /OATP 1 A 2, OCTN 1 and OCT 1. Gene expressions of BCRP and OCT 1 in murine mammary glands were increased during gestation and lactation, whereas MDR 1, MRP 1, OATP 1 A 5 and OCTN 1 were decreased, compared to expressions in virgins. All transporters measured in mammary glands of mice were detected in bovine mammary tissue and in HC 11 cells, while only MDR 1 and MRP 1 were detected in BME-UV cells. Prochloraz treatment induced MDR 1 gene and protein expression in both differentiated HC 11 and BME-UV cells and increased protein function in HC 11 cells, resulting in decreased accumulation of the MDR 1 substrate digoxin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that murine (HC 11) and bovine (BME-UV) mammary epithelial cells can be applied to characterize expression and function of transporters as well as effects of contaminants on the mammary transporters. An altered expression, induced by a drug or toxic chemical, on any of the transporters expressed in the mammary epithelial cells during lactation may modulate the well-balanced composition of nutrients and/or secretion of contaminants in milk with potential adverse effects on breast-fed infants and dairy consumers...|$|R

40|$|Transporters {{localized}} in membranes of secreting mammary {{epithelial cells}} {{are involved in}} delivery of essential nutrients into milk. However, drugs and other xenobiotics may be substrates of these transporters and thus be actively secreted into milk, which may pose a health threat to breastfed infants and dairy consumers. Aims of the thesis were to determine expressions of drug transporters in mammary gland tissue and to assess mammary cell models for studies of these proteins. Gene expressions {{of members of the}} ABC (BCRP/ABCG 2, MDR 1 /ABCB 1, MRP 1 /ABCC 1) and SLC (OATP 1 A 2 /SLCO 1 A 2, OCTN 1 /SLC 22 A 4, OCT 1 /SLC 22 A 1) families were measured in murine and bovine mammary tissue and in murine (HC 11) and bovine (BME-UV) mammary epithelial cell lines. BCRP function was assessed by transport experiments with mitoxantrone (MX) in HC 11 cells. Effects of the <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> prochloraz on transporter expression and function in HC 11 and BME-UV cells were examined. Expressions of BCRP and OCT 1 in murine mammary glands were increased during gestation and lactation, whereas MDR 1, MRP 1, OATP 1 A 2 and OCTN 1 were decreased, compared to expression in virgins. All transporters measured in mammary glands of mice were detected in bovine mammary tissue. All transporters investigated in vivo were also detected in HC 11 cells, while only MDR 1 and MRP 1 were detected in BME-UV cells. Differentiation of HC 11 cells resulted in increased BCRP protein expression, while MDR 1 expression was reduced. The BCRP inhibitor elacridar reduced secretion and increased accumulation of MX in both undifferentiated and differentiated HC 11 cells. An increased accumulation of MX was observed in BCRP gene silenced HC 11 cells. Prochloraz treatment induced MDR 1 gene expression and protein function in both differentiated HC 11 and BME-UV cells, resulting in decreased accumulation of the MDR 1 substrate digoxin. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the HC 11 and BME-UV mammary cell models are valuable tools for identifying substrates, inhibitors and inducers of transport proteins expressed in the mammary epithelium during lactation. The models can be used both to examine if chemical compounds are actively transported into milk and if they disrupt the normal function of transporters which may result in a disturbed delivery of essential nutrients into milk...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{production}} {{was investigated in}} the winter oilseed rape variety Capricorn by comparing crops grown under standard husbandry conditions in three seasons (1991, 1992 and 1993 harvest years). Also investigated were {{the effects of the}} phytotonic <b>imidazole</b> <b>fungicide</b> prochloraz on the physiology of yield production. Prochloraz was applied in autumn, spring and summer in all possible combinations (eight treatments), except in the second season (1992), when the autumn application was omitted. Crop growth and development were studied in detail using stratified sampling in 20 cm layers. Detailed growth analysis between flowering and final harvest was restricted to untreated controls and plots receiving all three prochloraz applications. Solar radiation interception was measured using tube solarimeters arranged to correspond with layers of the profile obtained in sampling. The qualitative pattern of growth and development was the same in all three seasons regardless of variations in environmental conditions, and could be divided into the four distinct but overlapping stages described in previous studies. Potential yield (pod number) was determined at flowering and was almost constant between seasons. It did not limit final yield and can never be fully realised. Final seed yield was dependent upon the amount of solar radiation intercepted in Stage IV (seed development), and was manifested in the extent of pod and seed losses and seed growth during this period. The efficiency of radiation use varied between seasons. The main role of leaves was the development of the reproductive framework, and rapid leaf senescence occurred at flowering, particularly in Stage III (pod development). Losses of potential pods and seeds were continuous from flowering onwards but were severe in Stage III. Pod retention was determined by the availability of assimilates which depended on radiation interception and intra-plant competition for assimilates. Regulation of this was probably under hormonal control. Dry matter {{production was}} unaffected by the flower canopy except when radiation levels were unusually low during Stage III. Final yield was not affected by such effects. Seed number per pod is determined genetically, but modified during development by assimilate availability according to position in the canopy and the number of competing pods. Seed growth occurred mainly in Stage IV and depended upon the extent of photosynthesis, largely in pods and branches. Seed yield was independent of growth up to flowering, and no remobilisation of dry matter occurred to support seed-filling. When open canopies were produced, leaf retention (largely {{at the base of the}} pod canopy), radiation interception by leaf, and therefore, assimilation by leaf, were all increased. Under such circumstances, assimilate production by leaf at the base of the pod canopy may have contributed up to 20 % of the dry matter (seed) produced in Stage IV. Pod and seed retention were improved throughout, but particularly higher in the canopy, because seeds that were growing well were more likely to be retained. Disease development in all treatments was monitored using detailed assessments throughout each season. The main fungicidal effects of prochloraz were on light leaf and pod spot and stem canker. Disease incidence was reduced in all seasons, but severity was reduced only in 1993. However, disease severities were generally very low, and these fungicidal effects probably had little or no effect on yield. Large losses of potential yield were caused by severe sclerotinia infection combined with high temperatures, a high soil moisture deficit, and possibly lodging (1992). Sclerotinia was controlled by iprodione in 1993. Disease data were used to form a model to estimate the expected yield losses caused by sclerotinia infection. Heavy infections of stem canker in 1993 did not seriously affect yield. Prochloraz increased seed yield by up to 16 % in 1991 through increased pod numbers largely in the upper and middle regions of the pod canopy. Seed number per pod was increased slightly, largely due to higher retention in lower pods, while 1000 -seed weight was not affected. Effects were negative in 1992 and inconclusive in 1993. Prochloraz increased crop growth from March onwards in 1991, and the differences in green area and dry matter components were maintained to final harvest. There was no effect on harvest index. Leaf senescence was delayed by prochloraz so that during Stage IV (seed development), leaf area index in the pod canopy and just below was greater in treated plots, and the proportion of radiation intercepted by leaf was slightly increased. Total radiation interception was increased due to the increased green area index mainly due to increased pod and stem areas in the top and middle of the canopy. Prochloraz delayed crop senescence and therefore reduced the decline in efficiency in late Stage IV. Total assimilate production in Stage IV was increased partly because of continued assimilate production for longer in all organs including retained leaf. This enabled more pods to be supported throughout the canopy. By prolonging assimilatory activity in the organs at the base of the canopy, prochloraz probably modified the pattern of assimilate movement between layers of the canopy. Seed numbers per pod in lower pods and pods higher in the canopy would, therefore, have been maintained. Reasons for the failure of prochloraz to elicit a similar response in 1992 and 1993, and the nature of the phytotonic effect are discussed. The findings are discussed in relation to the development of an oilseed rape ideotype for maximising yield production...|$|R
