2500|$|As the [...] "Notes" [...] {{section of}} the music braille chart above {{indicate}}s, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note. [...] For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th note) C. Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 128th <b>notes</b> use the same symbols, as do quarter <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 64th <b>notes,</b> half <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 32nd <b>notes,</b> <b>and</b> whole <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 16th <b>notes.</b> [...] Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, <b>and</b> whole <b>notes).</b> [...] For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear. [...] For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.|$|R
