40|$|Current {{technological}} {{challenges in}} materials science and high-tech device industry require {{the solution of}} boundary value problems (BVPs) involving regions of various scales, e. g. multiple thin layers, fibre-reinforced composites, and nano/micro pores. In most cases straightforward application of standard variational techniques to BVPs of practical relevance necessarily leads to unsatisfactorily ill-conditioned analytical and/or numerical results. To remedy the computational challenges associated with sub-sectional heterogeneities various sophisticated homogenization techniques need to be employed. Homogenization refers to the systematic process of smoothing out the sub-structural heterogeneities, leading to the determination of effective constitutive coefficients. Ordinarily, homogenization involves a sophisticated averaging and asymptotic order analysis to obtain solutions. In {{the majority of the}} cases only zero-order terms are constructed due to the complexity of the processes involved. In this paper we propose a constructive scheme for obtaining homogenized solutions involving higher order terms, and thus, <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>higher</b> accuracy and greater robustness of the numerical results. We present a form of homogenization which permits the establishment of a link with conventional Finite Element Method (FEM). © 2008 SPIE...|$|E

Policy-makers propose that this could, {{at least to some}} extent, be achieved through increased consumption of animal products produced under labeling schemes <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>higher</b> standards of animal welfare. Yet considerable uncertainties exist about the ability of the market to promote animal welfare. So far the consumption of most welfare-friendly products has been limited, and the impact of driving and limiting factors is poorly understood. Reviewing market studies, we identify the factors that have shaped the relatively successful market for grass milk in Denmark. We conclude that the positive drivers such as an appealing animal welfare attribute and animal welfare being bundled with other qualities are essentially the same as those operating in connection with less successful animal welfare-friendly products. It is therefore to be expected that other animal welfare-friendly food products marketed via “natural behaviors” in the farm animals will catch the interest of consumers. However, grass milk consumption has been supported by proper labeling, ready availability and low price premiums as well as multifaceted public support. This suggests that successful cases require the joint presence of a number of positive drivers as well as low consumption barriers...|$|E
40|$|In [DF 92], {{we present}} simple conditions, {{which we now}} describe, for <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>higher</b> normal forms for {{relational}} databases. A key is simple if it consists of a single attribute. We show in [DF 92] that if a relation schema is in third normal form (3 NF) and every key is simple, then it is in projection-join normal form (sometimes called fifth normal form), the ultimate normal form with respect to projections and joins. We also show in [DF 92] that if a relation schema is in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) and some key is simple, then it is in fourth normal form (4 NF). These results give the database designer simple sufficient conditions, {{defined in terms of}} functional dependencies alone, that guarantee that the schema being designed is automatically in higher normal forms. In [Bu 93], Buff gives a nice generalization of the second of these results. He defines a set C of attributes to be a cut of a relation schema if every key of the schema intersects both C and its complement. He proves that if a relation schema is in BCNF and has no cut, then it is in 4 NF. Buff’s Theorem is an immediate consequence of the lemma (Lemma 5. 1) that we used in [DF 92] to prove our second result. Therefore, we should have discovered it (but we didn’t!...|$|E
40|$|One {{ultimate}} goal of metabolic network modeling is the rational redesign of biochemical networks to optimize the production of certain compounds by cellular systems. Although several constraint-based optimization techniques {{have been developed for}} this purpose, methods for systematic enumeration of intervention strategies in genome-scale metabolic networks are still lacking. In principle, Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs; inclusion-minimal combinations of reaction or gene deletions that lead to the fulfilment of a given intervention goal) provide an exhaustive enumeration approach. However, their disadvantage is the combinatorial explosion in larger networks and the requirement to compute first the elementary modes (EMs) which itself is impractical in genome-scale networks. We present MCSEnumerator, a new method for effective enumeration of the smallest MCSs (with fewest interventions) in genome-scale metabolic network models. For this we combine two approaches, namely (i) the mapping of MCSs to EMs in a dual network, and (ii) a modified algorithm by which shortest EMs can be effectively determined in large networks. In this way, we can identify the smallest MCSs by calculating the shortest EMs in the dual network. Realistic application examples demonstrate that our algorithm is able to list thousands of the most efficient intervention strategies in genome-scale networks for various intervention problems. For instance, {{for the first time we}} could enumerate all synthetic lethals in E. coli with combinations of up to 5 reactions. We also applied the new algorithm exemplarily to compute strain designs for growth-coupled synthesis of different products (ethanol, fumarate, serine) by E. coli. We found numerous new engineering strategies partially requiring less knockouts and <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>higher</b> product yields (even without the assumption of optimal growth) than reported previously. The strength of the presented approach is that smallest intervention strategies can be quickly calculated and screened with neither network size nor the number of required interventions posing major challenges...|$|E

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{shrinking}} {{state and}} local resources for domestic violence prevention and detection, governments face a critical {{question of how to}} best allocate scarce funds. This paper suggests some answers for treating violence by caregivers and presents a model for evaluating other programs. To reach our conclusions, we analyzed data and survey results supplied by more than 1700 county-level adult protective services (APS) authorities. We found that some expensive programs produce very few results in terms of reporting, investigating, and substantiating elder abuse. For example, requiring a specific education or experience level (and therefore <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>higher</b> salaries) or even instituting an elder abuse training program (expensive in terms of personnel required, record keeping and time taken off field work) in and of themselves made no statistical difference. It also appears to make no difference whether the program is administered on the state or local level, or whether the investigators used screening devices as opposed to a more gestalt approach. However, three factors do apparently contribute significantly to investigator effectiveness. The first, whether the investigator believes that intervention makes elders better off, sounds like a psychological issue. It probably reflects, however, the placement and program alternatives the survey respondents had available. Money could perhaps be saved from reducing education or training requirements and spent instead on services such as respite care and homemaking services for the caretakers. Another very significant group of results involved specialization by APS personnel. Holding constant state effects including laws and socioeconomic characteristics, workers who specialized in elders (rather than doing both child and adult investigations) consistently did significantly better. Similarly, those with longer (as opposed to merely token) training programs also had higher rates of investigation and substantiation. The policy recommendation seems clear. Instead of worrying about training all social workers to detect elder abuse, we urge that the resources should be concentrated on the social workers exclusively focusing on APS...|$|E
40|$|Nanolimes, i. e. dispersions of lime (Ca(OH) 2) {{nanoparticles}} in alcohol, {{have been}} extensively investigated {{over the last}} two decades as consolidation products for calcareous substrates.   The use of nanolimes for consolidation of mural paintings arises from the lack of effective and compatible consolidants for this type of substrates; the use of nanolimes was later extended also to limestone and lime-based mortars, as an alternative for silica-precursor consolidants (e. g. tetraethoxysilan - TEOS), which had shown to have a limited effectiveness and compatibility with calcareous substrates. Nanolime dispersions are characterized by a very small size of the lime particles, which should provide a proper penetration within the porous network of most building materials. In fact, a homogeneous and in-depth penetration of the consolidant is a crucial requirement when dealing with decayed stones and plasters/renders. The effectiveness of nanolime dispersions reported in literature appears controversial. Some authors observed a proper penetration and moderate consolidating action, whereas others report poor penetration, poor consolidation action and sometimes the formation of a white haze on the treated surface.   There is no agreement concerning the factors affecting the transport and deposition of the lime nanoparticles within a porous network, and the causes of the observed drawbacks are not well understood. Therefore, the main research question is:  Is nanolime a suitable alternative to silica-precursor consolidants (e. g. TEOS) for the consolidation of calcareous substrates? More specifically, the following research questions can be formulated: – How and up to which extent can the effectiveness and compatibility of nanolime be improved? How can deposition of nanolime in depth be improved and the appearance of a white haze on the surface avoided? – How can nanolime properties be fine-tuned to improve the effectiveness and compatibility of the treatment? – What is the effect of different application methods on the effectiveness of nanolime consolidation? This research investigates and elucidates the behaviour of nanolime products for consolidation of calcareous substrates. Based on the developed knowledge, it proposes and validates a methodology (including solvent modification and application protocol) for improving the consolidation effectiveness of nanolime dispersions, making these a suitable alternative for TEOS products. Firstly, an experimental campaign was carried out in order to understand the penetration and deposition of commercial nanolimes on coarse porous calcareous substrates (Maastricht limestone). The main cause of the poor nanolime deposition in-depth was identified in the back-transport of the nanoparticles towards the drying surface, as a consequence of the high volatility and low kinetic stability of the dispersions. The modification of the nanolime properties, through the optimization of the solvent, appears thus a feasible strategy to improve the in-depth deposition of the lime nanoparticles. New nanolimes were synthetized and dispersed in a selection of solvents conferring different stability and drying rate to the obtained nanolime dispersions. A conceptual model, correlating the properties (i. e. drying rate and kinetic stability) of nanolimes dispersed in different solvents, to the moisture transport behaviour of the substrates to be treated, was conceived. The model was experimentally validated on coarse porous (Maastricht) and fine-porous (Migné) limestones.   Experimental results confirmed the predictions of the model that nanolimes dispersed in solvent with lower volatility and stability (e. g. water or butanol) have a good in-depth deposition within coarse porous networks. On the other hand, solvents with higher volatility and <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>higher</b> kinetic stability (e. g. ethanol or isopropanol) to the relative dispersions, should be preferred for substrates with fine porous networks. Fine-tuning the properties of the nanolime dispersion (by modification of the solvent) to the moisture transport behaviour of the substrate, is shown to be a successful strategy for improving in-depth deposition of lime nanoparticles.   On the basis of the obtained results, the solvent mixture was further fine-tuned using ethanol-water mixtures. Results proved that ethanol-based nanolime, mixed with a minor amount of water (5 %), can provide better nanoparticles in-depth deposition within coarse porous substrates (e. g. Maastricht limestone), when compared to dispersions in pure ethanol. The application procedure of nanolime dispersions was also studied and optimized, this step being a crucial aspect for a successful consolidation; nanolimes were applied both by capillary absorption (method commonly used for laboratory tests) or by nebulization (method widely used in situ) on a coarse porous limestone and a mortar.   The research showed that results obtained by application through capillary absorption do not always correspond to those obtained by nebulization. The effectiveness and compatibility of nanolimes with improved properties and a fine-tuned application protocol were finally verified. Fresh and weathered Maastricht limestone, as well as lime-based mortars, were treated. Results showed that nanolime dispersions can guarantee an in-depth consolidation both in laboratory mortar specimens and weathered limestone, with only a moderate alteration of the total porosity and of the moisture transport properties of the investigated substrates.   Therefore, nanolime dispersions, provided that they are properly formulated and applied, can be a suitable and compatible alternative to TEOS for the consolidation of coarse porous substrates.   This dissertation contributes to define guidelines to support restorers and professionals in the choice and application of nanolime dispersions for consolidation of calcareous substrates...|$|E
