As production {{has moved into}} deeper water it has proved advantageous to incorporate sections of <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> into the mooring lines. However, this has highlighted torsional interaction problems that can occur when ropes of different types are joined together. This paper describes a method by which the torsional properties of ropes can be modelled and can then be {{used to calculate the}} rotation and torque for two ropes connected in series. The method uses numerical representations of the torsional characteristics of both the ropes, and equates the torque generated in each rope under load to determine the rotation at the connection point. Data from rope torsional characterization tests have been analysed to derive constants used in the numerical model. Constants are presented for: a six-strand wire rope; a torque-balanced fibre rope; and a <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> that has been designed to be torque-matched to stranded wire rope. The calculation method has been verified by comparing predicted rotations with measured test values.

40|$|PublishedOne {{immediate}} {{challenge for}} the Marine Energy Converters (MECs) industry is solving the cost and weight problems of mooring lines in deepwater (> 75 m). <b>Fibre</b> <b>rope</b> taut mooring lines represent a new and interesting option for the mooring of MECs in deepwater. Synthetic fibre ropes offer {{a solution to the}} weight problems of using steel lines in deepwater as they have a very low weight in water. Also, compared to steel, there are a large number of synthetic fibre material compositions {{with a wide range of}} material properties. A synthetic rope can therefore be designed to have properties that match the mooring requirements. Several materials have potential for mooring line application. Yarns of these synthetic materials can be made into ropes using a number of constructions, some of which are suited to particular fibres. As with any new application, research must be conducted to determine how well the fibre ropes satisfy the performance requirements. The effects of aging of fibre ropes will be characterized in the proposed tests. Test facilities at the University of Exeter are unique in the MARINET consortium, as they allow the extensive testing of mooring lines in water. Their testing infrastructure will help us to determine which prospective innovative <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> mooring line is best suited for deepwater MECs. Also, the technological and scientific support offered by the well experienced staff is another reason to propose the access to these two tests facilities.

The marine renewable energy (MRE) sector is now at a stage in its development whereby floating devices are adding new challenges to the moorings industries. Floating MRE devices are smaller than, for instance offshore platforms, and are usually targeted for deployment in highly energetic environments. The extreme conditions and the highly dynamic response of an MRE device present challenges in terms of peak loading within the mooring system itself and load transfer to the floating body. Compliant mooring systems provide advantages by reducing the peak loads and fibre ropes are an important asset in achieving such compliance. However, {{the extent to which}} existing fibre ropes can safely extend axially to provide compliance is insufficient and is strongly associated to the minimum breaking load (MBL) of the rope. A novel <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> mooring tether is presented here that provides advantages over existing ropes. The tether employs a hollow <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> containing an elastomeric core, this mechanism de-coupling the extension properties from the strength of the line. The load path is carried through the polyester rope which is terminated conventionally by eye splices, thus minimising any new risks to reliability. Very low axial stiffness is achieved and is shown to be selectable within limits. For comparison, the prototype tether’s MBL of 222 kN is assigned to polyester and Nylon reference ropes. The axial stiifness of these ropes are 590 kN and 463 kN respectively when measured by a secant between the origin and 30...|$|E
40|$|Highly dynamic {{floating}} bodies such as {{wave energy}} convertors require mooring lines with particular mechanical properties; the mooring system must achieve adequate station keeping whilst controlling mooring tensions within acceptable limits. Optimised compliant mooring systems can meet these requirements but where compliance is achieved through system architecture, {{the complexity of}} the system increases together with the mooring footprint. This work introduces the ‘Exeter Tether’, a novel <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> mooring tether providing advantages over conventional fibre ropes. The tether concept aims to provide a significantly lower axial stiffness by de-coupling this attribute from the minimum breaking load of the line. A benefit of reduced axial stiffness is the reduction of mooring system stiffness providing a reduction of peak and fatigue loads, without increasing mooring system complexity. Reducing these loads improves system reliability and allows a reduction in mass of both the mooring system and the floating body, thus reducing costs. The principles behind the novel tether design are presented here, along with an outline of eight prototype tether variants. Results from the proof of concept study are given together with preliminary findings from sea trials conducted in Falmouth Bay. Results demonstrate that the Exeter Tether can be configured to achieve a significantly lower axial stiffness than conventional <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> and that the stiffness is selectable within limits for a given breaking strength. Strain values greater than 0. 35 are achieved at 30 % of line breaking strength; this represents more than a threefold increase of the strain achievable with a conventional rope of the same material. The tether was subjected to six months of sea trials to establish any threats to its own reliability and to inform future design enhancements in this respect...|$|E
