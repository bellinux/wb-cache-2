50|$|Originally, {{the school}} was {{primarily}} for boarders and {{a large percentage of}} pupils came from military families, hence the names of the houses. The original plan for the houses was to put children of army <b>families</b> <b>into</b> Marlborough house, children of air force <b>families</b> <b>into</b> Churchill house and children from naval <b>families</b> <b>into</b> Nelson house. However, so few children came from naval or air force backgrounds that many of the army children filled in the spaces in the other houses. This plan is no longer used today; pupils are assigned a random house as soon as they join the school.|$|R

France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal <b>family</b> <b>into</b> exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria.

5|$|Baron Franz Nopcsa, in 1902, {{proposed}} a new grouping of dinosaurs, Acanthopholididae, a clade of lightly-built thyreophorans. He included {{in it the}} genera Acanthopholis, Polacanthus, Syngonosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and possibly Nodosaurus. Soon after, he also added Priodontognathus and Palaeoscincus. He considered Acanthopholididae to be the sister clade to Stegosauridae, and also stated that it might include Hylaeosaurus, which he found had most {{of the characteristics of}} the family. Later, in 1915, he rearranged the species included in it. The genera that were later included were Acanthopholis (=Anoplosaurus), Polacanthus, Stegopelta, Stegoceras, and Struthiosaurus. Along with Ankylosaurus, Acanthopholididae was defined to form a subfamily of Nodosauridae. In 1923 he divided up the <b>family</b> <b>into</b> two subfamilies without comment. These two subfamilies were named Acanthopholinae and Struthiosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the <b>family</b> <b>into</b> eight tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, when Ernest was six, Henry Shackleton gave up {{his life}} as a {{landowner}} to study medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, moving his <b>family</b> <b>into</b> the city. Four years later, the family moved again, from Ireland to Sydenham in suburban London. Partly this was in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, but another factor may have been unease about their Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the assassination by Irish nationalists of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the British Secretary for Ireland, in 1882.|$|E

5|$|It was de Jussieu in 1789 {{who first}} {{formally}} created a 'family' (Narcissi), as the seventh 'Ordo' (Order) {{of the third}} class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed. The {{use of the term}} Ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. The family has undergone much reorganisation since then, but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family, Amaryllis, as 'Amaryllideae' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since. Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the <b>family</b> <b>into</b> two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus, omitting N. serotinus.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1815, {{three months}} after his father's death, Cofresí married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arcángel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary {{documents}} are unclear about her birthplace; although it is also listed as Curaçao, she was probably born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff's father, Geraldo. Months later Cofresí's father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the <b>family</b> <b>into</b> debt. Three years after his marriage Cofresí owned no property and lived with his mother-in-law, Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germán, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Matías) who died soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson {{was born}} in Newquay, Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of Henry Wickham Steed, {{journalist}} and editor of The Times from 1919 until 1922. Reverend Stevenson, a Congregational minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the <b>family</b> <b>into</b> economic distress. An uncle who was a solicitor funded Stevenson's ongoing education at Dulwich College in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available {{to allow him to}} attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an articled clerk in his uncle's legal practice. Stevenson was determined to become a barrister, and joined the Inner Temple, of which he became the treasurer in 1972.|$|E

5|$|The <b>family</b> <b>into</b> {{which she}} was born had been steeped in {{political}} agitation for generations. Her mother, Sophia Jane Craine, was a Manx woman from the Isle of Man and counted among her ancestors men charged with social unrest and slander. In 1881 the Isle of Man was the first country to grant women {{the right to vote}} in national elections. Her father, Robert Goulden, came from a modest Manchester merchant family with its own background of political activity. His mother worked with the Anti-Corn Law League, and his father was present at the Peterloo massacre, when cavalry charged and broke up a crowd demanding parliamentary reform.|$|E
5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first <b>family</b> <b>into</b> the second family.

Thereafter, the Vorbunker was used by various military officers and housed men from Hitler's personal bodyguard. In April 1945, as the Battle in Berlin raged on, Joseph Goebbels showed his strong support for Hitler by moving his <b>family</b> <b>into</b> the Vorbunker. He occupied a room in the Führerbunker which had recently been vacated by Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell. Two rooms in the Vorbunker were used for food supply. Constanze Manziarly, Hitler's personal cook/dietitian, made meals in the kitchen, which was equipped with a refrigerator and a wine store.|$|E

40|$|Despite some {{recruitment}} {{success in}} biomedical research among minorities, participation by African-American <b>families</b> <b>into</b> research, specifically genetic research, {{is lower than}} Caucasian families (Bowen and Penchaszadeh Community Genet 11 : 189 – 190, 2008). Such low participation rates by African-Americans prevent the exploration of specific ethnic differences in patterns of diseases and diminish the identification of specific disease risks among ethnic groups (Bowen and Penchaszadeh Community Genet 11 : 189 – 190, 2008). Although African-Americans are heterogeneous, few studies exist to describe effective recruitment strategies across diverse African-American populations, and even fewer studies share effective strategies for the enrollment of African-American <b>families</b> <b>into</b> genetic research.
