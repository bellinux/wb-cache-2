5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out {{of a desire to}} <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something that had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> {{of the hands}} of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E

5|$|In 1794, after a {{successful}} {{campaign in the}} Nha Trang region, Nguyễn Ánh ordered de Puymanel to build a citadel at Duyen Khanh, near the city, instead of retreating south with the seasonal northeasterly breeze. A Nguyen garrison was established there {{under the command of}} Nguyễn Ánh's eldest son and heir, Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, assisted by Pigneau and de Puymanel. The Tây Sơn laid siege to Duyen Khanh in May 1794, but Nguyen forces were able to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> Shortly after the siege ended, reinforcements arrived from Saigon and offensive operations against the Tây Sơn duly resumed. The campaign {{was the first time that}} the Nguyễn were able to operate in Tây Sơn heartland during an unfavorable season. The defensive success of the citadel was a powerful psychological victory for the Nguyễn, demonstrating their ability to penetrate Tây Sơn territory at all times of year. The Nguyễn then proceeded to slowly erode the Tây Sơn heartland.|$|E
5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to {{the width of the}} lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E

25|$|As an {{immediate}} {{consequence of the}} Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the public eye.|$|E
25|$|Before retreating, Romanian troops {{burned down}} the oil wells at Ploiești {{along with the}} {{surrounding}} wheat fields so as to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> {{of the hands of}} the Central Powers. After Falkenhayen's Ninth Army cut off a portion of the Romanian Army, the remainder retreated to the Siret–Putna defensive line, one of the outermost defensive lines of Bucharest.

25|$|Starting {{around the}} mid-19th century, Wigan pit-brow girls scandalised Victorian society by wearing {{trousers}} {{for their work}} at the local coal mines. They wore skirts over their trousers and rolled them up to their waists to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the way. Although pit-brow lasses worked above ground at the pit-head, their task of sorting and shovelling coal involved hard manual labour, so wearing the usual long skirts of the time would have greatly hindered their movements.|$|E

25|$|Du Pont in his {{official}} report asserted that he fully intended {{to renew the}} attack the next day, but his captains were unanimously opposed. Keokuk sank during the night (with no loss of life), {{two or three of}} the monitors had sustained damage that would <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of further action for days if not weeks, and the captains agreed that nothing good could come from prolonging the battle. Even if they could knock out Fort Sumter, the rest of the fortifications remained, and the fleet had not penetrated the first defensive ring.|$|E
25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying to change {{things in the world}} that aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.|$|E
25|$|Dysdera {{are one of}} the few known {{arthropods}} to {{hunt and}} prey on woodlice, which is their main food source. Their wide jaws and large fangs help to overcome woodlice hard armor like shells, as well as their ability to release chemicals to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of harm's way. These adaptations also enable them to prey on other common ground-dwelling invertebrates such as silverfish, earwigs, millipedes, and small burying beetles. Dysdera crocata is the only species from the Dysdera family to prey on other spiders. Dysdera spiders' huge, sharp fangs make them very powerful predators for their size, allowing them to dominate, and sometimes kill, competitors such as centipedes and other spiders.|$|E

25|$|By 1883 the {{membership}} of the SLP had fallen to an estimated 1500 members in just 30 Sections, a depressing atrophy which had led to the abandonment of the organization in April of that year even by its nominal head, Corresponding Secretary Philip Van Patten. Two individuals filled the role on a temporary basis {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in the party's 4th National Convention in December 1883. There the 16 delegates, in an effort to forge links with non-party revolutionary socialists in an effort to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the camp of the rival anarchist movement, decided to steer the organization on a leftward course, curtaining the authority of the governing National Executive Committee and abolishing the centralizing post of Corresponding Secretary altogether in an effort to render the SLP a more decentralized organization amenable to the revolutionary left.|$|E
25|$|As the British advanced, {{the hostages}} in Akbar Khan's hands were treated less {{severely}} than previously, {{although they were}} moved to Bamian to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of reach of the British armies. Nott was urged to send cavalry to rescue the hostages, but he declined to do so (possibly {{as a result of}} a minor disaster on 29 August, when his cavalry had suffered heavy losses in a mishandled attack). Instead, Pollock sent Qizilbashi irregular cavalry under Richmond Shakespeare (his Military Secretary) and infantry under Brigadier Sale to rescue them. They found that when news of the Afghan defeats reached their guards, the hostages, including Sale's own wife, had negotiated their own release in return for payments. In all, thirty-five British officers, fifty-one private soldiers, twelve officers' wives and twenty-two children who had been taken hostage by Akbar Khan were released.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes. In addition to moving towards a more wholistic style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular are focusing their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police now work with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided more education and after-school activities to try and <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of trouble. In addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate army {{experienced}} a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery. Mules pulled the wagons.

After 1863 the invading Union forces had {{a policy of}} shooting all the local horses and mules they did not need - in order to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers {{experienced a}} growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.|$|E
