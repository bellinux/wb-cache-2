5000|$|High Forest (Forgotten Realms) — A vast, densely forested region just to {{the west}} of the Anauroch desert. These {{woodlands}} are home to elves, centaurs, satyrs, wild creatures, and many mysteries. At its southern heart are the towering Star Mounts, from which flows the Unicorn Run to the south to join the River <b>Delimber.</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. We {{compared}} {{the performance of}} a flail/chipper for processing a) whole poplar trees and b) poplar trees that had been roughly delimbed with a pull-through <b>delimber.</b> Production rate was about 10 % higher for the delimbed trees. The reduced cost of flail/chipping would’not cover the additional cost of delimbing with the machine mix tested, but changes to equipment might improve the situation. In the test configuration, the <b>delimber</b> processed 175 trees per productive hour, about half as many as the DDC. Delimbing separated about 35 dry pounds per tree of limbs, which may have higher value than the mixture of limb and bark residues produced by the flail from whole trees...|$|E
40|$|The Pulp and Paper Industry in the Pacific Northwest is obtaining an {{increasing}} share of its fiber supply by chipping small diameter trees from thinnings, insect damaged stands, and stand conversions. Since {{most of the}} mills require pulp grade fiber to contain less than 0. 5 % bark, the timber must be debarked prior to chipping. Traditional single-stem debarking operations {{have proven to be}} expensive compared with multiple-stem alternatives. Thus, three portable chain-flail delimber-debarker systems have recently been developed in the Pacific Northwest. Two of the systems employ self-contained prototypes capable of simultaneously delimbing and debarking multiple whole-tree loads. The third is a two-machine system, with a mobile chain-flail <b>delimber.</b> Chip samples obtained during short-term productivity studies average...|$|E
5000|$|Limbing (also {{known as}} [...] "chasing") in logging {{is the process}} of {{removing}} branches from the trunk of a fallen tree. Options for cutting off the branches include chain saws, harvesters, stroke <b>delimbers</b> and others. Limbing can happen at the stump in log/tree length systems and cut-to-length systems or at the landing in whole-tree logging.|$|R
40|$|Single stem short {{rotation}} plantations in the United States {{are largely}} dedicated to pulp production, with fuel as a secondary product. There are very limited plantings for fuel production, and others where {{the primary purpose}} is treatment of various wastewater’s. All production harvesting of single stem plantations is conducted with conventional forestry equipment. In the west, fellerbunchers. borapple skidders, chain fail delimber/debarker/chippers are used, and pulp furnish is transported in chip vans. Residues are cornminuted. and transported to energy facilities. In the Southeast. felled and bunched trees are deiimbed by skidders with irongate <b>delimbers,</b> and hauled to the pulp mill or a chipping plant in tree length form, where they are drum debarked and then chipped. Limbs and foliage are left on site. So far, there have only been limited trials with other equipment. The Canadian NRCC/HYD-Mech FB- 7 * and FB- 12 continuous-travel feller/buncher heads were tested in short rotation plantations. The FB- 7 worked well. but with trees much smaller than those currently being grown for pulp. The FB- 12, attached to an old carrier with poor hydraulics, was not veq productive with larger trees. The head appeared to have inherent deficiencies, the main one being the accumulation approach: holding trees vertically but loosely. This tended to put overturning moments on the machine and limited the sizes of the bunches that could be built. The Missoula Technology and Development Centre (MTDC) Harvester is a continuous-travel feller/buncher which has a collecting bunk and saw assembly mounted on a Timber/Jack 520 A prime mover (I&sky, 1992). When trees are severed, a rotating “bat ” knocks them into the collection bed where they lay horizontally. Bunches are side-dumped from the bunk. The MTDC Harvester was designed for dense natural stands of small trees; one test was also * The use of name brands and tradenames are {{for the convenience of}} the readers and IS not an endorsement of th...|$|R
40|$|Roadside {{chipping}} is {{a common}} harvesting system to produce chips in Australian plantations. This study investigated the productivity and cost of road-side chipping operation (chipping logs extracted by forwarder to the road side) using a Morbark chipper with flail <b>delimber</b> in a first thinning of Pinus radiata stands. An elemental time study method was used to collect the time working cycles. The regression approach was used to develop the productivity predicting model based on the log size in different wood piles. The statistical analysis yielded an average productivity of 59. 4 GMt/PMH 0 with the corresponding costs of 5. 2 AU$/GMt for the Morbark chipper. The details on work time analysis, relocation time and fuel consumption of the machine are documented in this paper. The results provide basic information for planning roadside chipping operations in pine plantations...|$|E
30|$|Vernon (1921, 1940) {{showed that}} the hourly {{production}} by U.K. munitions workers, working 11 hours per day for a six day week, was up to 37 % lower than when working 8 hours per day. The size of the decrease {{was related to the}} task being undertaken. Nevison (1992), cited in Dawson et al. (2004), reports a 20 % reduction in performance by white-collar workers when 60 or more weekly hours are worked. Hanna et al. (2005) found that hourly productivity of U.S. construction workers declined as the length of the working week increased beyond 40 hours; hourly productivity being 93 % and 79 % for 50 -hour and 60 -hour weeks, respectively. Studies of <b>delimber</b> operators working eight-hour day shifts in eastern Canada showed that productivity starts to decrease much earlier than eight hours; hourly productivity in the post-lunch phase was approximately 11 % lower than in the pre-lunch phase (Golsse 1991, 1992). Lebel et al. (2010) show the same trend for harvester operators working 12 -hour night shifts in eastern Canada; {{the second half of the}} shift being less productive than the first half of the shift. Contrary to Golsse’s findings, however, they report hourly productivity of day shift harvester operators being higher in the second half of the shift than the first half of the shift.|$|E
