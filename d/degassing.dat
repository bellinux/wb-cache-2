5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be <b>degassing</b> of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|Vigorous <b>degassing</b> {{of carbon}} dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are {{in the form of}} small {{isolated}} travertine mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with a steady flow {{of carbon dioxide}}. Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

25|$|In early {{models for}} the {{formation}} of the atmosphere and ocean, the second atmosphere was formed by outgassing of volatiles from the Earth's interior. Now it is considered likely that many of the volatiles were delivered during accretion by a process known as impact <b>degassing</b> in which incoming bodies vaporize on impact. The ocean and atmosphere would, therefore, have started to form even as the Earth formed. The new atmosphere probably contained water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and smaller amounts of other gases.|$|E

To prevent a recurrence, a <b>degassing</b> tube that siphons water from the bottom layers of water to the top allowing the carbon dioxide to leak in safe quantities was installed in 2001, and two additional tubes were installed in 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Cassatt's {{parents and}} sister Lydia had joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, all {{eventually}} {{to share a}} large apartment {{on the fifth floor}} of 13, Avenue Trudaine, (...) , again close to <b>Degas.</b> <b>Degas</b> became a frequent guest at the Cassatts, and likewise they at his soirées. <b>Degas</b> and Cassatt, accompanied by Cassatt's sister Lydia, were often to be seen at the Louvre studying art works together. <b>Degas</b> produced two prints, notable for their technical innovation, depicting Cassatt at the Louvre looking at art works while Lydia reads a guidebook. These were destined for a prints journal planned by <b>Degas,</b> which never subsequently came to fruition. In addition Cassatt frequently posed for <b>Degas,</b> notably for his millinery series trying on hats. She explained to Louisine Havemeyer that she only posed when his usual models could not get the idea of a particular pose demanded of them. At around this time <b>Degas</b> made a portrait in oils of Cassatt, Mary Cassatt Seated, Holding Cards. A circa 1880 Self-Portrait by Cassatt depicts her in the identical hat and dress, leading Griselda Pollock to speculate they were executed in a joint painting session {{in the early years of}} their acquaintance.|$|R
25|$|An example where Henry's law is at play {{is in the}} depth-dependent {{dissolution}} of oxygen and nitrogen {{in the blood of}} underwater divers that changes during decompression, leading to decompression sickness. An everyday example is given by one's experience with carbonated soft drinks, which contain dissolved carbon dioxide. Before opening, the gas above the drink in its container is almost pure carbon dioxide, at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. After the bottle is opened, this gas escapes, moving the partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid to be much lower, resulting in <b>degassing</b> as the dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of solution.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{of liquid}} surface water also {{requires}} a sufficiently thick atmosphere. Possible origins of terrestrial atmospheres are currently theorised to outgassing, impact <b>degassing</b> and ingassing. Atmospheres {{are thought to}} be maintained through similar processes along with biogeochemical cycles and the mitigation of atmospheric escape. In a 2013 study led by Italian astronomer Giovanni Vladilo, it was shown that the size of the circumstellar habitable zone increased with greater atmospheric pressure. Below an atmospheric pressure of about 15 millibars, it was found that habitability could not be maintained because even a small shift in pressure or temperature could render water unable to form as a liquid.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{sources of the}} CO2 are <b>degassing</b> of intruded magma and gas release from limestone-rich {{metasedimentary}} rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and isotopic composition of the CO2 and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along faults to the surface. Measurements of helium emissions support {{the theory that the}} gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain Fumarole. There is evidence that the rate of CO2 discharge has been declining, with emissions peaking in 1991.|$|E
