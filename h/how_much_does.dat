Dick {{pointed out}} the moral {{ambiguity}} of the story, laying out its political implications: [...] "Should we have a leader or should we think for ourselves? Obviously the latter, in principle. But – sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical." [...] This quote became {{part of a larger}} political analysis of Dick's work in <b>How</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Does</b> Chaos Scare You? by Aaron Barlow, Associate Professor of English at New York City College of Technology. In analyzing Dick's short fiction, Barlow presented their themes against the backdrop of post-September 11, 2001 America. In particular, Barlow compared many of the philosophical underpinnings of Neoconservatism, and its rise to prominence during the George W. Bush administration, to the philosophy of Philip K. Dick. [...] "To ," [...] writes Barlow, [...] "the elites were both alien and dangerous. To him, the focus of vision and of political debate should never be on the rulers, but on the little person, the shopkeeper, the mechanic." [...] In his dissection of Dick's work, Barlow compared several stories in which normal humans lose some form of liberty in their society to an elite group. Examples presented include [...] "Autofac", [...] "Null-O", and [...] "Some Kinds of Life". From these stories, Barlow drew three themes important to Dick's anti-government writings: first, that humanity is often doomed by institutions of power created by the humans themselves; second, that paranoia is a natural aspect of governance, as [...] "o elite can ever completely trust the people it governs," [...] and this distrust leaves a governed people in perpetual danger; and third, that the belief that individuality must be sacrificed—either for the sake of social stability or survival—is a constant threat. [...] "To Dick," [...] Barlow adds, [...] "there are few attitudes more dangerous than this." [...] Each of these themes would be revisited in [...] "The Last of the Masters".|$|E

2500|$|The {{substitution}} is not detected and {{corrected by}} the reflective system. For example, when asked [...] "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 {{more than the}} ball. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>does</b> the ball cost?" [...] many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10. An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.|$|E

Therefore, whenever this excess accumulates to about 30 days, or a little more or less, one month is added and the particular year is made to consist of 13 months, {{and this is the}} so-called embolismic (intercalated) year. For the year could not consist of twelve months plus so-and-so many days, since it is said: throughout the months of the year (...) , which implies that we should count the year by months and not by days." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the second}} half of the 18th century Philadelphia had {{developed}} an upper-class society. Many of the families that made up the upper class could trace their lineage to the earliest Quaker settlers, though many of these had subsequently joined the Church of England or Presbyterian denominations. The Philadelphia upper class was exclusive; what mattered was a person's family, not a person's wealth. Inheritance was better than self-made wealth. In the late 19th century Mark Twain observed, [...] "In Boston they ask <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>does</b> he know. In New York, how much is he worth. In Philadelphia, who were his parents." [...] A person could not enter Philadelphia society by acquisition of wealth, but their offspring, if they grew up well and married into the right family, could create a new lineage if the family stayed respectable.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Deming {{suggested}} [...] "There's {{just one}} problem with the gay agenda: it's based on a lie. Homosexuals are not like heterosexuals, nor is the practice of homosexuality innocuous. The single largest problem for the gay agenda is medical science. [...] The fact that about two-thirds of syphilis and AIDS cases occur amongst {{one percent of the}} population tells us something that is immediate and unambiguous: that homosexuality is not an innocuous choice. What gay men do behind closed doors is fundamentally different from what heterosexuals usually do in their bedrooms. [...] We are informed, endlessly, of the costs of gun violence, cigarette smoking, and obesity. What is the cost of homosexuality? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>does</b> it cost to treat syphilis, AIDS, and a whole host of other diseases? What cost will we bear for the reemergence of syphilis, a disease that was almost eradicated? Neither are these plagues limited to gays. Bisexual men spread them into the heterosexual population." ...|$|E
