To identify the causal relation between these variables, the analysis utilizes over-time variation in the supply of skilled labor {{and the extent to}} which this variation affects the skill content of trade given the bilateral distance between im- and exporter. In a panel estimation covering 41 non-OCED members, a one standard deviation higher geographic pressure to import human capital is associated with a 12 % reduction in the national average length of schooling.

The model is based on heterogeneous workers who make educational decisions in the presence of complete markets. When heterogeneous workers invest in schooling, high type agents earn a surplus from their investment. Trade shifts this surplus to rich countries that can use skills more efficiently.

40|$|To date, {{the gold}} {{standard}} for characterizing neurons and assessing the action of drugs on them are voltage clamp protocols in patch clamp recordings [1]. However, {{it is now clear that}} the classical procedure, where measurements performed using constant voltage steps and channel blockers are averaged over several cells, does not typically allow the construction of accurate Hodgkin-Huxley type models [2]. Here we propose to go beyond the classical procedure and rely on optimized stimulation patterns to isolate the effect of different ion channels. We represent stimulation patterns as clamped cubic splines defined by a number of support points. Cubic splines can approximate steps or sinusoids, as well as arbitrary shapes; clamped splines avoid discontinuities around the endpoints. To measure the degree to which a given pattern can isolate the contribution of one channel, a reference neuron is detuned in two different ways. The first detuned neuron has one set of parameters increased by a certain factor, while in the second a different set of parameters is similarly detuned. The separation power of a stimulation pattern for these two sets of parameters is then defined as the ratio of the <b>divergence</b> <b>factors</b> of the two detuned neurons, which are defined as the sum of squared errors between the reference and detuned trans-membrane currents. Optimal patterns are constructed by adjusting the support points to maximize this ratio, typically through a combination of a genetic algorithm for exploring the search space, and gradient descent for fine-tuning. We show that for many parameters pairs in a Hodgkin-Huxley model, there are stimulation patterns which yield a clear dissociation between the effects of the selected parameters.

[...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical refences. Due to an {{increase}} in the use of conformal antennas in military and commercial applications, the study of surface fields excited by a current distribution on material coated perfect electric conductor (PEC) surfaces is becoming more important. These surface fields are useful in the efficient evaluation of mutual coupling of conformal slot/aperture antennas {{as well as in the}} design/analysis of conformal antennas/arrays which can be mounted on aircrafts, missiles, mobile base stations, etc. On the other hand, impedance boundary condition (IBC) is widely used in surface field problems because it can model a thin material coated (or partially coated) PEC geometry and reduces the complexity of the surface field problem by relating the tangential electric fields to the tangential magnetic fields on the surface. Evaluation of surface fields on the circular cylinder and sphere geometries is a canonical problem and stands as a building block for the general problem of surface fields excited on arbitrary smooth convex surfaces. Therefore, high frequency based asymptotic solutions for the surface fields on a source excited PEC convex surface have been investigated for a long time, and surface fields on such surfaces have been obtained by generalizing the surface field expressions of the PEC cylinder and sphere. In this dissertation, a uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) -based high frequency asymptotic formulation for the appropriate Green’s function representation pertaining to the surface fields excited by a magnetic current source located on an arbitrary smooth convex surface with an IBC is developed. In the course of obtaining the final UTD-based Green’s function representation, surface field expressions of cylinder and sphere geometries are written in normal, binormal, tangent [(ˆn, ˆb,tˆ) ] coordinates and their important parameters such as the <b>divergence</b> <b>factor,</b> the Fock parameter and Fock type integrals are generalized according to the locality of high frequency wave propagation. The surface field expressions for the arbitrary convex impedance surface are then written by blending the sphere and cylinder solutions through blending functions, which are introduced heuristically. Numerical results are selected from singly and doubly curved surfaces. Because of the lack of numerical results for the surface fields for impedance surfaces in the literature, obtained results are compared with those of PEC surfaces in the limiting case where the surface impedance,Zs → 0.

40|$|Theoretical seismograms of {{spheroidal}} disturbances on {{the surface}} of an elastic sphere consisting of a homogeneous mantle and a liquid core are calculated when uniform radial stress is applied to a small circle around the pole. The effect of gravity is taken into consideration. Contributions are included from the free spheroidal oscillations of the first few radial modes for all orders with periods larger than 12 sec. The results of these computations are compared with the corresponding quantities for the case excluding the effect of gravity. Noteworthy results from the study of spheroidal disturbances propagating {{on the surface}} of a gravitating elastic sphere with a homogeneous mantle and a liquid core, when the uniform radial stress is applied to a circular area around the pole, are : 1. The difference between non-dimensional frequency for the present case and for the case excluding the effect of gravity is not a simple function. The discrepancy is large for modes lying along the branch specified by i= 1 '; it tends toward negligible values as the order number increases. 2. The corresponding phase and group velocities exhibit their greatest differences for the first three radial modes and for orders less than about 15. The number of maxima and minima for the group velocity curves increases with radial mode number i. Curves connecting corresponding maxima and minima tend toward the value U/VS 0 =≒ 1. 2 as the period decreases to zero; {{in the case of the}} homogeneous sphere these curves approach 1. 3. 3. The amplitudes of the Common Spectrum suggest that higher radial modes with i≠ 10 may still give appreciable contributions to the theoretical seismogram. 4. The Rayleigh wave shows a simple disturbance consisting of approximately one cycle of oscillation. The pattern of wave propagation can be explained by the concept of dispersion. 5. The convergence of the wave form of the P wave by the successive addition of radial higher modes is not so rapid as in the case without gravity. The slower convergence is caused by the difference of the time and space functions of the applied forces and by the minimum values of period employed in the synthesis. 6. The orbital motion of the Rayleigh wave shows a phase advance of π/ 2 near the antipode. 7. In the seismograms showing body waves, the surface-reflected S waves end abruptly near the travel time of a wave propagating along the surface with the shear wave velocity. 8. The variation of amplitude of the body waves as a function of epicentral distance can be explained by the theory of the <b>divergence</b> <b>factor,</b> after accounting for the effect of reflection at the surface.

Pelargonium clades exhibiting higher ecological differentiation along summer precipitation (SPP) gradients also experienced higher diversification rates. Faster rates of niche differentiation in spatially structured variables, along with lower levels of niche overlap among closely related species, suggest recent modification in species niches (e. g. dispersal or range shift) and niche lability.

Germany is chosen to be a benchmark country and thus the development towards Germany is also examined. The results reveal that new member states converge towards the benchmark country. However, {{in the case of}} old member states both convergence and <b>divergence</b> occurs. Furthermore, <b>factors</b> that may have an influence on such a development are investigated. The empirical research shows that GDP, hiring regulations and minimum wage and business regulation were of significance during the examined period, from 2000 to 2009 respectively...|$|R

But employment trends diverged more recently, with employment rising at older ages and falling at younger ages, {{for both men and}} women. This paper seeks to explain this divergence. We estimate labor supply models for men and women, allowing differences in behavior across age groups. The results indicate that changes in the educational composition of the population and Social Security reforms can account for a modest proportion of the <b>divergence.</b> An additional <b>factor</b> for men was the increase in age at first marriage. However, much of the divergence remains unexplained...|$|R

This thesis describes one of the methods predicting the initial diverging speed of a single vortex in a parallel vortex field near wall. The method uses first order potential flow theory to predict the initial speed of one of the vortices. In this study, the center vortex was evaluated to simulate an infinite vortex sheet. A parametric {{study was conducted}} to see how various factors would impact the initial vortex <b>divergence</b> speed. The <b>factors</b> include the circulation strength of the vortices, the vertical distance between the wall to the vortex cores, the distance between each vortex cores, and the perturbation distance of another vortex to create the divergence of the vortex of interest...|$|R
