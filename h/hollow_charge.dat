25|$|Meanwhile, {{the effect}} of very compact <b>hollow</b> <b>charge</b> warheads was being noted {{and a number of}} {{countries}} began producing man-portable anti-tank weapons utilizing this ammunition. The development of man-portable, shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket launchers began in 1941; most could be reloaded, but a few such as the German Panzerfaust were fired from disposable tubes. Unlike anti-tank guns, their light weight made them easily portable by individual infantrymen on the battlefield, and they offered similar degrees of firepower whilst being quicker and cheaper to produce.|$|E

25|$|Anti-tank guns {{deployed}} during World War II were {{manned by}} specialist infantrymen rather than artillery crews, and issued to light infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37mm ammunition, {{except for the}} British Army, which had developed the 40mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder. As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger and more effective armor-piercing shot. The development of the compact <b>hollow</b> <b>charge</b> projectile permanently altered anti-tank warfare, since this type of ammunition did not depend on a high muzzle velocity and could be fired from low-recoil, man-portable light weapons such as the Panzerfaust and the American series of recoilless rifles.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, German {{engineers}} had proposed a new large caliber anti-tank gun which used less propellant than a rocket or recoilless weapon, yet fired similar compact <b>hollow</b> <b>charge</b> shells. German forces subsequently fielded the 8 cm PAW 600, which was an extremely lightweight, low pressure weapon still able to fire the same ammunition types as higher velocity anti-tank guns. In the 1950s, this idea was revived by a Belgian firm, Mecar, which subsequently improved on the concept and developed a low pressure, smoothbore 90mm anti-tank gun. Because of its low recoil forces and light construction, the gun was particularly useful for being mounted on armored cars or small gun carriages. Its design inspired the lightly rifled French DEFA D921 anti-tank gun, which fired fin-stabilized shells and was available on a towed carriage or as a vehicle mount. It was later mated to the AML-90 and EBR series of French armored cars. The Soviet Union also adopted a similar design at around the same time, the 100mm T-12 anti-tank gun, which was smoothbore and fired fin-stabilized shells. Switzerland developed a postwar 90mm anti-tank gun of its own, the Pak 50/57, firing shells with an even lower velocity than the Mecar or DEFA guns. All these weapons could only use HEAT shells for armor-piercing purposes, save for the T-12, which utilized APDS rounds. France did introduce an APFSDS shell for the DEFA D921 {{at some point in the}} 1980s. The last country known to have produced a dedicated anti-tank gun was the People's Republic of China, in 1988. The Chinese gun was known as the Norinco Type 86 and was probably manufactured as a replacement for the ageing Soviet-sourced T-12.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to these}} limitations, a new {{infantry}} anti-tank weapon was required, and this ultimately {{came in the}} form of the Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank, commonly abbreviated to PIAT. The origins of the PIAT can be traced back as far as 1888, when an American engineer by the name of Charles Edward Munroe was experimenting with guncotton; he discovered that the explosive would yield a great deal more damage if there were a recess in it facing the target. [...] This phenomenon is known as the 'Munroe effect'. The German scientist Egon Neumann, found that lining the recess with metal enhanced the damage dealt even more. By the 1930s Henry Mohaupt, a Swiss engineer, had developed this technology even further and created <b>hollow</b> <b>charge</b> ammunition. This consisted of a recessed metal cone placed into an explosive warhead; when the warhead hit its target, the explosive detonated and turned the cone into an extremely high-speed spike. The speed of the spike, and the immense pressure it caused on impact, allowed it to create a small hole in armour plating and send a large pressure wave and large amounts of fragments into the interior of the target. It was this technology that was utilized in the No. 68 anti-tank grenade.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} <b>hollow</b> <b>charges</b> occurred in 1792. Franz Xaver von Baader (1765-1841) was a German mining engineer at that time; in a mining journal, he advocated a conical {{space at the}} forward end of a blasting charge to increase the explosive's effect and thereby save powder. [...] The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the Harz mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive {{at the time was}} gunpowder, which is not a high explosive and hence incapable of producing the shock wave that the shaped-charge effect requires.|$|R

2500|$|In 1979 Dynamite Nobel AG {{received}} a development order, the first troop test began in 1986, and in 1992 Panzerfaust 3 was officially introduced. The improved PzF 3-T replaced the original {{model in the}} late 1990s, introducing a dual <b>hollow</b> <b>charge</b> [...] "tandem" [...] warhead to defeat explosive reactive armour. This means that the spike projecting from the warhead itself also contains an explosive charge to set off reactive armour and free {{the path to the}} main armour for the secondary warhead. The latest incarnation of the Panzerfaust 3, the PzF 3-IT-600, can be fired from ranges up to 600 metres thanks to an advanced computer-assisted sighting and targeting mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|By March and April the {{situation}} had become desperate for German forces. The Soviets had reached the Oder and were encroaching upon Berlin. Fw 190s were now used in unusual ways to destroy the Soviet bridgeheads across the Oder. Focke-Wulfs were attached the upper fuselage of a [...] Junkers Ju 88 [...] "host" [...] by struts which also contained control cables to allow the Fw 190 pilot to fly the combination using his flight controls. The operational versions of the Mistel replaced the cockpit section of the Ju 88 with a shaped, <b>hollow</b> <b>charge</b> warhead weighing, in total, 3,500kg – {{the weight of the}} explosives was 1,700kg. The Fw 190 pilot would approach to within a few kilometers of the target, aim the Ju 88 at the bridges, then release his Fw 190 and escape while the Ju 88 flew into the target. These weapons, which, in some versions, used a Bf 109F-4 instead of an Fw 190, were used against the vital Küstrin bridgeheads. Küstrin was due east of Berlin, and if it could be held, a Soviet advance on Berlin could be prevented. Several Fw 190 strike units from Kampfgeschwader 200 struck at the bridges throughout April; the maximum effort on 16 April succeeded in inflicting damage to the captured bridges, but none were destroyed. One Mistel was shot down by a patrol of Supermarine Spitfires of the Canadian 411(RCAF) Squadron. One Mistel did force a partial collapse of the Steinau railway bridge earlier, on 31 March 1945. On 26 April 1945, one last Mistel attack was carried out; of the seven sent to hit the Oder bridges, just two Fw 190s returned. On 1 May 1945, IV.Jagdgeschwader 3 flew its last combat, losing three out of four Fw 190s over Berlin. On this date the Soviet 16th Air Army claimed seven Fw 190s, its last victories of the war.|$|E

25|$|Delay might {{endanger the}} outcome of the entire campaign, because it was {{essential}} that the main body of Allied troops be engaged before Army Group A established bridgeheads. To overcome this difficulty, the Germans resorted to unconventional means in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. In the early hours of 10 May, DFS 230 gliders landed on top of the fort and unloaded assault teams that disabled the main gun cupolas with <b>hollow</b> <b>charges.</b> The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers. The Belgians launched considerable counterattacks which were broken up by the Luftwaffe. Shocked by a breach in its defences just where they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the KW-line five days earlier than planned. Similar operations against the bridges in the Netherlands, at Maastricht, failed. All were blown up by the Dutch and only one railway bridge was taken. This stalled the German armour on Dutch territory for a time.|$|R

To prove the Fe 3 + ions radial penetration into the hydrophobic core of carbonaceous template, we optimized the ethanol to water ratio. The Fe 2 TiO 5 -TiO 2 yolk-shell hollow spheres exhibited high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate up to 148 mu mol g(- 1) h(- 1) under UV-vis light. This was attributed to the better light harvesting due to the geometry of <b>hollow</b> sphere; <b>charge</b> separation by a thin shell yolk hetero-junction, a void cavity to access reaction solvent to reactive sites and the hetero-junction of Fe-O-Ti in the hollow structure.
