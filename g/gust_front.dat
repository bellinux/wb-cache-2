5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a <b>gust</b> <b>front</b> that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E

An automated method is developed to quantify lightning within an MCS (using a Lagrangian method to follow the storm). Continuous "stripes" of lightning activity, caused by squall lines, emerge in lightning Hovmollers over West Africa and are substantially longer than the typical wavelength of an an African Easterly Wave (AEW). These stripes are used to study the relationships among MCS development, extent, and propagation distance: MCSs with greater squall line lengths propagate greater distances on average, but no evidence is found to show that larger, deeper systems propagate any faster than smaller systems, contrary to results in the literature. Evidence is shown that in many cases continuity within a lightning stripe is mediated by <b>gust</b> <b>fronts.</b> MCSs were found to propagate distances greater than an AEW wavelength, but only {{in the absence of an}} AEW; it is shown that AEWs were absent for many key weeks in summer 2006. by Michael McGraw-Herdeg.

They commonly have anvil clouds.|$|R
500|$|At ground level, shelf {{clouds and}} roll clouds {{can be seen}} at the leading edge of outflow boundaries. [...] Through {{satellite}} imagery, an arc cloud is visible as an arc of low clouds spreading out from a thunderstorm. If the skies are cloudy behind the arc, or if the arc is moving quickly, high wind gusts are likely behind the <b>gust</b> <b>front.</b> [...] Sometimes a <b>gust</b> <b>front</b> can be seen on weather radar, showing as a thin arc or line of weak radar echos pushing out from a collapsing storm. The thin line of weak radar echoes is known as a fine line. [...] Occasionally, winds caused by the <b>gust</b> <b>front</b> are so high in velocity that they also show up on radar. This cool outdraft can then energize other storms which it hits by assisting in updrafts. Gust fronts colliding from two storms can even create new storms. Usually, however, no rain accompanies the shifting winds. An expansion of the rain shaft near ground level, in the general shape of a human foot, is a telltale sign of a downburst. Gustnadoes, short-lived vertical circulations near ground level, can be spawned by outflow boundaries.|$|E
500|$|A gustnado, or <b>gust</b> <b>front</b> tornado, is a small, {{vertical}} swirl {{associated with}} a <b>gust</b> <b>front</b> or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate {{as to whether or}} not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a [...] "rolling" [...] effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.|$|E
500|$|A derecho (from Spanish: [...] "" [...] meaning [...] "straight") is a {{widespread}} and long-lived, violent convectively induced straight-line windstorm {{that is associated with}} a fast-moving band of severe thunderstorms usually taking the form of a bow echo. Derechos blow in the direction of movement of their associated storms, similar to a <b>gust</b> <b>front,</b> except that the wind is sustained and generally increases in strength behind the [...] "gust" [...] front.

50|$|Cumulonimbus {{clouds are}} the final form of growing cumulus clouds.

500|$|An outflow boundary, {{also known}} as a <b>gust</b> <b>front,</b> is a storm-scale or {{mesoscale}} boundary separating thunderstorm-cooled air (outflow) from the surrounding air; similar in effect to a cold front, with passage marked by a wind shift and usually a drop in temperature and a related pressure jump. Outflow boundaries can persist for 24 hours or more after the thunderstorms that generated them dissipate, and can travel hundreds of kilometers from their area of origin. New thunderstorms often develop along outflow boundaries, especially near the point of intersection with another boundary (cold front, dry line, another outflow boundary, etc.). [...] Outflow boundaries can be seen either as fine lines on weather radar imagery or else as arcs of low clouds on weather satellite imagery. From the ground, outflow boundaries can be co-located with the appearance of roll clouds and shelf clouds.|$|E
500|$|The {{two major}} ways {{thunderstorms}} move are via advection {{of the wind}} and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest [...] of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the <b>gust</b> <b>front,</b> or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in {{any type}} of thunderstorms, the surface cold pool of air {{associated}} the downdraft will stabilize the air and form a cloud free area which will end along the <b>gust</b> <b>front.</b> This mesoscale front, when moving into a warm and unstable air mass, will lift it and cumulus clouds appear on satellite pictures. This line is likely the point of further convection and storms. One can notice it {{at the leading edge}} of a squall line, in the southeastern quadrant of a typical supercell (in the northern hemisphere), or different regions around other thunderstorms. They may also be visible as an outflow boundary hours or days after convection and can pinpoint areas of favored thunderstorm development, possible direction of movement, and even likelihood for tornadoes. The speed of forward movement of the outflow boundary or <b>gust</b> <b>front</b> to some degree modulates the likelihood of tornadoes and helps determine whether a storm will be enhanced by its presence or the inflow be choked off thus weakening and possibly killing the storm. [...] Thunderstorms may move along slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries and tornadoes are more likely; whereas fast moving gust fronts in many cases weaken thunderstorms after impact and are less likely to produce tornadoes—although brief tornadoes may occur at the time of impact. Fast moving gust fronts may eventually decelerate and become slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries with the characteristic [...] "agitated area" [...] of cumulus fields previously mentioned.|$|E

40|$|Low-altitude winds on the meso- and {{microscale}} are {{the primary}} focus of study for the Research Applications Program (RAP) of NCAR. Local weather features such as microbursts, microburst lines, <b>gust</b> <b>fronts,</b> and convergent wind boundaries have been observed and documented extensively. A microburst is a strong, small-scale convective storm outflow which diverges horizontally in all directions upon impact with the ground (Fujita, 1981). A microburst line is composed of two or more microbursts which occur either simultaneously or consecutively, and subsequently form a diverging line of outflow. The temporal and spatial scales of these phenomena are shown. Microbursts and microburst lines generally occur on both the meso- and microscale, while <b>gust</b> <b>fronts</b> and convergent wind boundaries overlap into the mesoscale. Microbursts, in particular, not only are small spatially but are also a short-lived phenomenon. Clearly, some of these features are on a much smaller spatial and temporal scale than can be resolved by a global wind measurement. During the past three years, three experiments were held in the Denver, CO, area to observe boundary-layer winds. Their main objectives were observation and documentation of those weather features discussed above. The Joint Airport Weather Studies (JAWS) Project, which ran in the summer of 1982, was set up to study microbursts. The Convective Initiation Project (1984) was designed to document clear-air convergent wind boundaries, including <b>gust</b> <b>fronts,</b> and their role in convective storm initiation. This project was immediately followed by the Classify, Locate, and Avoid Wind Shear experiment that expanded upon the work done in JAWS. Details on the scales of these weather features are presented. The wind sensors used to detect these phenomena are also discussed. Concluding comments address the usefulness of a global wind measurement system as it pertains to our local scale of interest...|$|R
50|$|Many storms contain shelf clouds, {{which are}} often mistaken for wall clouds, since an {{approaching}} shelf cloud appears to form a wall made of cloud and may contain turbulent motions.
