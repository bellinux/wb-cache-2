The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the <b>defrosting</b> time by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the compressor's suction pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method. In addition, when the TES based reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method was used, the mean indoor coil surface temperature during <b>defrosting</b> was about 25 K higher than that when the traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method was used.

25|$|Freezing: In cold {{conditions}} the cooling effect of gas expanding through a valve orifice may cool either {{first or second}} stage sufficiently to cause ice to form.

40|$|Abstract: Air/water {{heat pumps}} for heating systems are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. A major challenge for these systems is the formation of ice and frost in the fin-tube evaporator. <b>Defrosting</b> is usually accomplished by the reverse-cycle or hot-gas <b>defrosting</b> technique. In both <b>defrosting</b> modes, the compressor is in operation. An alternative method is ambient-air <b>defrosting,</b> where the heat pump’s compressor is simply turned off and <b>defrosting</b> is achieved by exposure to ambient air, which is conveyed through the fin tube evaporator by the fan. A model has been developed which permits the calculation of the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the melting of ice and frost deposits. The theoretical results have been validated by numerous <b>defrosting</b> experiments. The theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that both temperature and humidity of the ambient air strongly influence the total heat flow and the time needed for <b>defrosting.</b> Already at an ambient air temperature of 2 °C and a dew point temperature of 0 °C, the heat flow of ambient-air <b>defrosting</b> is {{comparable to that of}} hot-gas defrosting; energy consumption is decreased by a factor of 8 – 10, however. On the other hand, ambient-air <b>defrosting</b> is less effective at air conditions below the extended fog-isotherm at 0 °C.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit {{is used for}} space heating at a low ambient {{temperature}} in winter, frost may be formed on its outdoor coil surface. Over time, frost accumulation on coil surface may become sufficient to restrict air passage through the coil and increase the heat transfer resistance between ambient air and coil surface, leading to performance degradation for the outdoor coil, or even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Therefore, periodic <b>defrosting</b> is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard <b>defrosting</b> method for an ASHP unit is reverse cycle <b>defrosting.</b> During a standard reverse cycle <b>defrosting</b> (SRCD) operation, the indoor coil in an ASHP unit actually acts as an evaporator. Because the indoor fan is usually turned off during <b>defrosting,</b> there is an insignificant amount of energy from indoor coil, leading to a number of associated operational problems such as a longer <b>defrosting</b> duration and the risk of having a lower air temperature inside a heated space during <b>defrosting,</b> etc. To solve the fundamental problem of insufficient heat available during <b>defrosting</b> while ensuring the efficient and safe system operation, a novel reverse cycle <b>defrosting</b> (NRCD) method which is thermal energy storage-based using sub-cooling energy of refrigerant for ASHPs has been developed. Comparative experiments using both the SRCD method and the NRCD method were carried out on an experimental ASHP unit with a nominal 2. 5 kW heating capacity. Experimental results clearly suggested that when using the NRCD method, the discharge and suction pressures were increased by 0. 56 and 0. 12 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the <b>defrosting</b> duration and heating-resumption duration were shortened by 30. 8 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, and the <b>defrosting</b> energy consumption was reduced by 13. 9 %, compared to those when using the SRCD method. Practical application: ASHPs have been widely used worldwide due to their significant energy-saving potentials. However, frost can be formed on the outdoor coil surface when an ASHP unit operates for space heating. Frost accumulation on coil surface reduces the coil's efficiency, or causes even the shutdown of the ASHP unit.

This paper presents the reverse cycle <b>defrosting</b> performance for an ASHP unit with a PCM-HE acting as both a sub-cooler during heating operation and a heat source during <b>defrosting</b> operation, which could help to ensure the safe operation and achieve a higher <b>defrosting</b> efficiency of the ASHP unit.

2500|$|The {{heat pump}} is a {{refrigeration}} based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the {{indoor and outdoor}} coils. [...] This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a [...] "4-way" [...] or [...] "change-over" [...] valve). [...] During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat {{is removed from the}} outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. [...] The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool. [...] Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an [...] "O" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a [...] "B" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. [...] The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. [...] A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. [...] Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. [...] This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. [...] Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional <b>defrost</b> of the outdoor coil. [...] This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements. [...] The electric heat in <b>defrost</b> mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. [...] The elements are then used in the [...] "reheat" [...] function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in <b>defrost</b> and electric heat is activated, the <b>defrost</b> function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail.

Unfortunately it provokes {{a break in the}} heat production and the <b>defrosting</b> energy is drawn from the heat stock previously constituted. This article presents the design of a heat pump prototype for simultaneous heating and cooling (named HPS). Its refrigeration circuit involves a piece of refrigeration circuit that could be modified and implemented to standard air-source heat pumps during retrofit or maintenance in order to carry out <b>defrosting</b> with better performance. It uses a water tank that recovers the subcooling energy of the refrigerant at first and is subsequently used as a cold source for evaporation. The second part of the sequence liberates the air evaporator for <b>defrosting.</b> Between two evaporators (air-to-refrigerant and water-to-refrigerant) at different temperatures, a thermosiphon forms. A supplementary amount of vapour flows out of the water evaporator and migrates towards the colder inside surface of the air evaporator tubes in thermal contact with the frost layer. The vapour, while condensing, brings the <b>defrosting</b> energy. The liquid returns back to the water evaporator by gravity. This <b>defrosting</b> system was observed by means of infrared thermography and tested experimentally on a heat pump prototype. It proved very efficient as <b>defrosting</b> time was short. Using this <b>defrosting</b> technique ensures: - a continuous heat production with even better performance while <b>defrosting</b> thanks to the higher evaporating temperature, - more frequent <b>defrosting</b> sequences because more easily activated, impacting on lower frost thickness and higher mean heat transfer coefficients. A numerical study was carried out to assess the performance improvement achieved on a heating sequence. Simulations show a COP and an exergetic efficiency improvement respectively of 12 % and 18 %...|$|R

Our main goal was to find time of <b>defrosting</b> at the room temperature {{for a group of}} frozen products depending on their shape, size and a presence of yeast. We modeled dough <b>defrosting</b> procedure using the heat equation and Stefan problem - a moving boundary problem. We carried out numerical simulations using Matlab...|$|R
