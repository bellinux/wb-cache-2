40|$|We {{study how}} restricting CO 2 {{emissions}} affects resource prices and depletion over time. We use a Hotelling-style model with two non-renewable fossil fuels that {{differ in their}} carbon content (e. g. coal and natural gas) and in addition are imperfect substitutes in final good production. We show that an economy facing a CO 2 flow-constraint may substitute towards the relatively dirty input. As the economy tries to maximise output per unit of emissions {{it is not only}} carbon content that matters: productivity matters as well. With an announced constraint the economy first substitutes towards the less productive input such that more of the productive input is available when constrained. Preliminary empirical results suggest that it is cost-effective to substitute away from dirty coal to cleaner oil or gas, but to substitute from natural gas towards the <b>dirtier</b> input <b>oil.</b> Climate Policy, Non-Renewable Resources, Input Substitution...|$|R

50|$|Around 1796 Earnshaw, who had {{temporarily}} {{lost interest}} in the Board of Longitude reward, was tempted back {{by the failure of}} Josiah Emery to win it.

Earnshaw was easily proved right in this and his chronometer had a good average rate over a 12-month trial.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} systemic {{flaws in the}} US oil and gas regulation, and BP’s corporate governance that we argue predisposed the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico’s Outer Continental Shelf. This spill resulted in possibly the worst environmental disaster in United States (US) history overseen by the compromised US Minerals Management Service (MMS), which was restructured by the Reagan Administration during 1980 ’s. Regulatory capitalism is a neo-liberal development based on the ideology of reducing reliance on state regulation for expected efficiencies through fundamentalist ‘free-market’ capitalist mechanisms, such as competition, unfettered markets, minimal taxes and little government intervention to grease the wheels of industry. Regulatory capitalism is ostensibly from the government, in this instance the Reagan Administration, which gave the MMS a conflicting and ultimately disastrous mandate to regulate and collect revenue from offshore oil leases. BP and other oil companies have flourished under regulatory capitalism, where self-regulated corporate governance mechanisms {{have been allowed to}} control nature’s destiny. BP Annual Reports 2004 to 2009 and Sustainability Reviews are greenwashed by a company caught up in scandals and the <b>dirty</b> business of <b>oil</b> exploration and extraction.

40|$|Optimal climate {{policy is}} studied. Coal, the {{abundant}} resource, contributes more CO 2 {{per unit of}} energy than the exhaustible resource, oil. We characterize the optimal sequencing oil and coal and departures from the Herfindahl rule. "Preference reversal" can take place. If coal is very <b>dirty</b> compared to <b>oil,</b> there is no simultaneous use. Else, the optimal outcome starts with oil, before using oil and coal together, and finally coal on its own, The "laissez-faire" outcome uses coal forever or starts with oil until {{it is no longer}} profitable to do so and then switches to coal. The optimum requires a steeply rising CO 2 tax during the oil-only phase and a less steeply rising CO 2 tax during the subsequent oil-coal and coal-only phases to avoid the abrupt switch from oil to coal thus leaving a lot of oil in situ. Finally, we analyze the effects on the opitamal transition times and carbon tax of a carbon-free, albeit expensive backstop (solar or wind). Without a carbon tax, a prohibitive coal tax leads to less oil in situ, substantially delays introduction of renewable, and thus curbs global warming substantially. Subsidizing renewables to just below the cost of coal does not affect the oil-only phase. The gain in green welfare dominates the welfare cost of the subsidy if the subsidy gap is small and the global warming challenge is acute.

40|$|The Green Paradox states that, in {{the absence}} of a tax on CO 2 emissions, subsidizing a {{renewable}} backstop such as solar or wind energy brings forward the date at which fossil fuels become exhausted and consequently global warming is aggravated. We shed light on this issue by solving a model of depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels followed by a switch to a renewable backstop, paying attention to timing of the switch and the amount of fossil fuels remaining unexploited. We show that the Green Paradox occurs for relatively expensive but clean backstops (such as solar or wind), but does not occur if the backstop is sufficiently cheap relative to marginal global warming damages (e. g., nuclear energy) as then it is attractive to leave fossil fuels unexploited and thus limit CO 2 emissions. We show that, without a CO 2 tax, subsidizing the backstop might enhance welfare. If the backstop is relatively dirty and cheap (e. g., coal), there might be a period with simultaneous use of the non-renewable and renewable fuels. If the backstop is very <b>dirty</b> compared to <b>oil</b> or gas (e. g., tar sands), there is no simultaneous use. The optimum policy requires an initially rising CO 2 tax followed by a gradually declining CO 2 tax once the dirty backstop has been introduced. We also discuss the potential for limit pricing when the non-renewable resource is owned by a monopolist.
