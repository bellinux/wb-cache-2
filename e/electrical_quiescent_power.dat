The {{purpose of this}} project was to analyze and evaluate the output circuit stages of four non-invasive muscle stimulators. The stimulators were labeled Constant Voltage Transformer Isolated, Constant Current Transformer Amplified, Microstim Plus, and the Constant Current stimulator. The impedance of the human skin under constant current pulses was studied in 10 human subjects, in which the maximum impedances were computed. Accuracy of circuit simulations of the four devices was determined by comparing the output waveforms of the simulation {{to those of the}} hardware through models of passive loads. The evaluation of the four circuits was based on output range, <b>power</b> efficiency, <b>quiescent</b> <b>power,</b> output regulation, cost, weight, volume, and comfort level of the stimulation. The results showed that skin impedance for humans ranged from 5965 ohms to 1270 ohms.

The simulation for the Constant Voltage Transformer Isolated was the most accurate due to the simplicity of the circuit.

40|$|Resolving {{stability}} {{issue is}} one of the major challenges in designing a perfect op-amp, the most widely used analog circuit block. Many compensation techniques have been proposed to improve the stability performance of op amps, but virtually all these techniques were developed for continuous-time applications and subsequently applied to discrete-time applications (e. g., switched-capacitor circuits). Since the early 1980 s, an increasing number of op-amps have been used in switched-capacitor circuits with no special compensation method applied. Consequently, there remains a need to explore the possibility of designing a unique compensation method specifically for switched-capacitor use. A new switched-compensation technique (SCT) is proposed for switched-capacitor circuit applications in which high speed is a critical index of performance. In general, designers must deal with trade-offs among accuracy, speed, and power dissipation. SCT avoids traditional approaches of designing high-speed, high-gain operational amplifiers that are in many cases technology-limited. Instead, it modifies the switched-capacitor circuit structure to use the under-damped response of the system, usually regarded as a drawback. SCT is introduced as a novel solution for achieving fast settling performance and lower <b>quiescent</b> <b>power</b> dissipation while guaranteeing almost equivalent accuracy. SCT can be easily implemented in flip-around switched-capacitor amplifier circuits. This paper explains SCT principle and implementation applied to multiplying-digital-to-analog converters (MDACs) as a proof of concept.

40|$|To {{maximize}} the battery life of portable audio devices like iPods, MP 3 players and mobile phones, {{there is a}} need for audio power amplifiers with low <b>quiescent</b> <b>power,</b> high efficiency along with uncompromising quality (Distortion performance/ THD) and low cost. Despite their high efficiency, Class-D amplifiers are undesirable as headphone drivers in mobile devices, owing to their high EMI radiation, additional costs due to filtering required at the output and also their poor linearity at small signal levels. Almost all of todays headphone drivers are Class-AB linear amplifiers, with poor efficiencies. Here we propose a Class-G linear amplifier, which uses rail switching to improve efficiency. It can be viewed as a Class-AB amplifier operating from the lower supply and a Class-C amplifier from the higher supply. Though the classical definition of efficiency using full-scale sine wave does not show much improvement for Class-G (85. 9 percent) over Class-AB (78 percent), we demonstrate that the Class-G audio amplifiers can have significant improvement of efficiencies (battery life) in the practical sense. By considering the amplitude distribution of audio signals a new realistic definition of efficiency has been proposed. This definition helps in demonstrating the advantage of using Class-G over Class-AB and also helps in optimizing the choice of supply voltages which is critical to maximizing the efficiency of Class-G amplifiers. Two new circuit topologies have been proposed and thoroughly investigated. The first circuit is more like a developmental stage and is designed/fabricated in AMI 0. 5 um.

40|$|We {{describe}} a current-mode circuit for Gabor-type image filtering {{which uses a}} differential representation where positive (on) and negative (off) signals are encoded using separate channels. Previous current-mode implementations represented positive and negative signals as variations around a constant bias at every pixel. However, this bias current has several disadvantages. First, variations in it introduce significant additive fixed pattern noise to the output. Second, it dissipates power even with zero input. Third, if the output is encoded using the Address Event Representation, the bias current sets up a quiescent firing rate which loads the bus. The architecture proposed here alleviates these problems since a zero signal is encoded as nearly zero current in both channels. On the other hand, the transistor count and the address space are doubled.
