5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty <b>acids</b> octonoic and <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acids</b> can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|R

5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty <b>acids</b> (caprylic and <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acids),</b> lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|R

40|$|Abstract During {{treatment}} of winery and distillery wastewater by natural evaporation in ponds, formation of malodorous compounds induces harmful olfactory effects. In this work, we studied {{the origin of}} malodorous compounds and methods to prevent and treat odours. The formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from pure substrates (glycerol, lactic and tartaric acids, ethanol) and complex media (winery and distillery wastewater) was studied. Various anaerobic bacteria ferment the glycerol and produce butyric or propionic acid. Valeric and caproic acids were observed at lower concentrations than butyric and propionic acids, but their malodorous intensities were higher. Microflora produce butyric, valeric, caproic, <b>heptanoic</b> and octanoic <b>acids</b> from ethanol, {{the main component of}} winery wastewater. When nitrate (an electron acceptor) is added, catabolism leads to an anaerobic respiration phenomenon (denitrification). The organic compounds are oxidised to CO 2 and the nitrate is reduced to N 2 (odourless compounds), without VFA formation. The preventive {{treatment of}} odours by nitrate addition was tested on an industrial scale in winery and distillery ponds. Furthermore, the study took the effect of nitrate on VFA degradation into consideration. The results make it possible to consider using nitrate for the curative treatment of pond odours...|$|R

Power ultrasound is used to generate an in situ emulsified medium and to remove reaction products continuously from the electrode surface. A clean and highly efficient process at platinum electrodes with formation of 'one electron' products only occurs {{in marked contrast to}} processes in monophasic media. For hexanoic acid the Kolbe dimer product R-R is formed in up to 75 % yield with 45 % current efficiency at 0. 18 A cm- 2 current density and in the presence of 190 W cm- 2 ultrasound. The mechanism is explained in terms of a dynamically modified electrode surface, at which hydrophobic products are immediately 'trapped' via partitioning into a non-polar organic phase and transported away into the emulsion system. Kolbe electrosynthesis is undertaken both at platinum electrodes and at free-standing polycrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes, in order to minimize the surface erosion effect induced by power ultrasound. The type and yield of products obtained from the biphasic Kolbe electrolysis process at diamond electrodes are essentially identical to those observed at platinum and based on this observation, the presence of a biphasic reaction layer at the electrode surface is postulated to govern the process. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

Subtraction of single acids from the most attractive blend revealed that 3 -methylbutanoic acid had {{a negative effect on}} trap entry response. In the absence of tetradecanoic acid, the blend was repellent. In assays with MM-X traps, both a blend of 7 carboxylic acids + ammonia + lactic acid (all applied from low density polyethylene-sachets) and a simple blend of ammonia + lactic acid + tetradecanoic acid were attractive. The results show that carboxylic acids play an essential role in the host-seeking behavior of An. gambiae, and that the contribution to blend attractiveness depends on the specific compound studied...|$|E

The title 1 : 1 {{stoichiometric}} salt, C 7 H 10 N +C 7 H 13 O 2, {{is formed}} by proton transfer between <b>heptanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and benzylamine. This combination contrasts to the recently published 2 : 1 acid– amine adduct of cation, anion and neutral acid molecule {{from the same}} components [Wood & Clarke (2013). Acta Cryst. E 69, o 346 –o 347]. There are N—H O hydrogen bonds of moderate strength in the structure [the most important graph-set motifs are R 24 (8) and R 4 4 (12) ], as well as weak C—H O interactions.
