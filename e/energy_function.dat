25|$|A {{commonly}} cited counter-example where {{energy is}} not shared among its various forms and where equipartition {{does not hold}} in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. If the system is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, the energy in each normal mode is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the <b>energy</b> <b>function,</b> energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Energy</b> <b>functions</b> (or {{characteristic}} functions) {{and basic}} equations for ferroelectrics {{in use today}} are given by those for ordinary dielectrics in the physical and mechanical communications. Based on these basic equations and <b>energy</b> <b>functions,</b> the finite element computation of the nonlinear behavior of the ferro-electrics {{has been carried out}} by several research groups. However, it is difficult to process the finite element computation further after domain switching, and the computation results are remarkably deviating from the experimental results. For the crack problem, the iterative solution of the finite element calculation could not converge and the solutions for fields near the crack tip oscillate. In order to finish the calculation smoothly, the finite element formulation should be modified to neglect the equivalent nodal load produced by spontaneous polarization gradient. Meanwhile, certain <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> for ferroelectrics in use today are not compatible with the constitutive equations of ferroelectrics and need to be modified. This paper proposes a set of new formulae of the <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> for ferroelectrics. With regard to the new formulae of the <b>energy</b> <b>functions,</b> the new basic equations for ferroelectrics are derived and can reasonably explain the question in the current finite element analysis for ferroelectrics. ...|$|R

Here, we describe a simple procedure to derive and use pairwise distance-dependent potentials that rely on the definition of effective atomic interactions, which attempt to capture interactions that {{are more likely to be}} physically relevant. Based on a difficult benchmark test composed of proteins with different secondary structure composition and representing many different folds, we show that the use of effective atomic interactions significantly improves the performance of potentials at discriminating between native and near-native conformations. We also found that, in agreement with previous reports, the potentials derived from the observed effective atomic interactions in native protein structures contain a larger amount of mutual information. A detailed analysis of the effective <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> shows that atom connectivity effects, which mostly arise when deriving the potential by the incorporation of those indirect atomic interactions occurring beyond the first atomic shell, are clearly filtered out. The shape of the <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> for direct atomic interactions representing hydrogen bonding and disulfide and salt bridges formation is almost unaffected when effective interactions are taken into account. On the contrary, the shape of the <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> for indirect atom interactions (i. e., those describing the interaction between two atoms bound to a direct interacting pair) is clearly different when effective interactions are considered. Effective <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> for indirect interacting atom pairs are not influenced by the shape or the energy minimum observed for the corresponding direct interacting atom pair. Our results suggest that the dependency between the signals in different <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> is a key aspect that need to be addressed when empirical <b>energy</b> <b>functions</b> are derived and used, and also highlight the importance of additivity assumptions in the use of potential <b>energy</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
