5|$|The {{story of}} Dino Crisis {{takes place on}} a fictional {{location}} known as Ibis Island in the year 2009. The Secret Operation Raid Team (SORT) has sent an agent, Tom, to investigate a research facility. During the recon mission, he learns that Dr. Edward Kirk, a world-renowned scientist who was reported dead three years ago, is leading a secret weapons project within the facility. SORT sends four agents (Regina, Gail, Rick, and Cooper) to acquire Kirk and return him to custody. The team arrives on the island under cover of darkness, <b>dropping</b> <b>in</b> via parachute. Cooper is blown off course and lands in the jungle away from the others. Lost in the dark, he is chased down by a Tyrannosaurus rex and eaten. The other three agents, unaware of his death, proceed with the mission.|$|E

5|$|Along the Western front these began quite early {{after the}} war and {{continued}} for several decades, <b>dropping</b> <b>in</b> number in the mid-1920s, when interest in the war temporarily diminished, and again in the Depression years of the early 1930s. Flemish pilgrimages to Belgium graves, particularly the heldenhuldezerkjes, and memorials began in 1919, continuing through the subsequent decades. The Ossuary at Verdun was the centre for many veterans pilgrimages in the 1920s, one of the better known groups being the Fêtes de la Bataille, which travelled to the site to undertake a vigil, processions and lay wreaths. These pilgrimages were typically low-key and avoided military symbolism or paraphernalia. Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit; the Ypres League was established by veterans, and sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a purifying spiritual quest. The Menin Gate memorial became a focal point for British pilgrims to the Western front after it was opened in 1927. Pilgrims could come long distances: in the 1920s Canadians began to journey to Vimy and Australians began visiting Gallipoli from 1925 onwards, bringing back military souvenirs relics.|$|E

The road enters Hackensack with the lanes splitting again for the long interchange with Interstate 80.

The lanes rejoin upon splitting from Interstate 80 with a lane <b>dropping</b> <b>in</b> each direction at the County Route 56 (Essex Street) interchange on the Maywood border.

40|$|Prior {{literature}} {{indicates that}} bid-ask spreads are higher and depths are lower around earnings announcements than during non-announcement periods. This thesis investigates two {{important aspects of}} this <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> market liquidity, namely (a) the ability of management to mitigate the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> market liquidity around earnings announcements by using their discretion to announce the earnings news during non-trading instead of trading hours and (b) the conjecture that the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> market liquidity before earnings announcements relates to {{the richness of the}} information environment. The study confirms the idea that the intraday timing of earnings announcements affects the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> market liquidity.
