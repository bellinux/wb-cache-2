5|$|One major {{advantage}} of genome-scale RNAi screening <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes. With {{the ability to}} generate {{a large amount of}} data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of cell-based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, transfection with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, signal detection, analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 {{is thought to}} define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).|$|E
5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E

50|$|A big {{premise of}} MixRadio <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{download}} mixes offline. This enabled users {{to listen to}} their favourite mixes when not in range of a WiFi or mobile data connection.|$|R
50|$|During {{combat the}} player can also give basic {{commands}} to lancemates which had very simple AI. One interesting {{feature of this}} AI <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> retreat if a certain damage level was reached.|$|R
25|$|Another major {{advantage}} of the liquid core <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> be drained rapidly into a passively safe dump-tank. This advantage was conclusively demonstrated repeatedly {{as part of a}} weekly shutdown procedure during the highly successful 4 year ORNL MSRE program.|$|E
25|$|The carnival's main allure to its {{participants}} <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> change age easily against natural causes. Jim {{wants to}} become an adult by riding the carousel forward, and Charles Halloway initially considers riding the carousel backwards. Even Will is somewhat tempted by the offer for a free trip to adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} constitution of orellanine remained unknown until the Polish chemists Antkowiak and Gessner {{in the last}} half of the 1970s discovered that it was a bipyridine dioxide. Orellanine undergoes tautomerization, and the more stable tautomer is the amine oxide form. An interesting feature of orellanine <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bind aluminium ions to form chelation complexes.|$|E
50|$|An {{article in}} Nature Reviews Cancer in 2010 {{pointed out that}} five of the 'hallmarks' were also {{characteristic}} of benign tumours. The only hallmark of malignant disease <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> invade and metastasize.|$|R
500|$|... 1869:Dmitri Mendeleev {{publishes the}} first modern {{periodic}} table, with the 66 known elements organized by atomic weights. [...] The strength of his table <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> accurately predict the properties of as-yet unknown elements.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} aspect of Thorn EMI's business <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> manufacture, say, one of its Ferguson televisions and then to make it available for rental through its rentals sector or sell it through its retail sector.|$|R
25|$|Another {{emerging}} {{application of}} TALEN <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> combine with other genome engineering tools, such as meganucleases. The DNA binding region of a TAL effector {{can be combined}} with the cleavage domain of a meganuclease to create a hybrid architecture combining the ease of engineering and highly specific DNA binding activity of a TAL effector with the low site frequency and specificity of a meganuclease.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of aprepitant, and a major advantage it has over other chemotherapy-induced side-effect treatments, <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> selectively antagonize NK1 receptors, while having very low affinity to other common receptors such as serotonin, dopamine, and corticosteroid. It is estimated that aprepitant is at least 3,000 times more selective to NK1 receptors compared to these other enzyme transporter, ion channels.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} {{offers a}} number of advantages over other polymerization methods and in general. The most significant advantage of plasma polymerization <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce polymer films of organic compounds that do not polymerize under normal chemical polymerization conditions. Nearly all monomers, even saturated hydrocarbons and organic compounds without a polymerizable structure such as a double bond, can be polymerized with this technique.|$|E
50|$|GetRight is a {{shareware}} {{download manager}} developed by Michael Burford. Burford's company, Headlight Software, first published {{the program in}} 1997. At {{the time of its}} release, one of GetRight's defining features <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> resume an interrupted download.|$|R
50|$|When {{formed into}} a thin plastic film, the {{principal}} advantages of polyvinylidene chloride, when compared <b>to</b> other plastics, <b>are</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adhere to {{itself and its}} very low permeability to water vapor, flavor and aroma molecules, and oxygen. This oxygen barrier retards food spoilage, while the film barrier to flavor and aroma molecules helps food retain its flavor and aroma.|$|R
2500|$|A key {{component}} {{of the success of}} the Rays in 2008 <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hang on late in games. [...] The team took eleven walk-off victories in the 2008 regular season, and one in the postseason, four of which were home runs: ...|$|R
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of press forging, {{as compared to}} drop-hammer forging, <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deform the complete workpiece. Drop-hammer forging usually only deforms the surfaces of the work piece {{in contact with the}} hammer and anvil; the interior of the workpiece will stay relatively undeformed. Another advantage to the process includes the knowledge of the new part's strain rate. By controlling the compression rate of the press forging operation, the internal strain can be controlled.|$|E
25|$|The third {{trait that}} evolved in S. mutans <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> not only survive, but also thrive in acidic conditions. This trait gives S. mutans a {{selective}} advantage over {{other members of}} the oral microbiota. As a result, S. mutans could outcompete other species, and occupy additional regions of the mouth, such as advanced dental plaques, which can be as acidic as pH 4.0. Natural selection is most likely the primary evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this trait.|$|E
25|$|Of course, brutal scenes – witness The Massacre of the Innocents – {{have been}} {{important}} and regularly visited motifs {{in the history of}} art. What makes Helnwein's art significant <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make us reflect emotionally and intellectually on the very expressive subjects he chooses. Many people feel that museums should be a refuge in which to experience quiet beauty divorced from the coarseness of the world. This notion sells short the purposes of art, the function of museums, and the intellectual curiosity of the public.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Robert Scrivener (1855 - 1923) {{recommended}} {{the site for}} Canberra in 1909, {{which was to be}} a planned capital city for the country. One {{of the reasons for the}} location's selection <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> store water [...] "for ornamental purposes at reasonable cost".|$|R
50|$|From the outset, he was {{convinced}} that film's essential feature was also a defining American trait. This <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> capture 'movement, and that happened to be the one dominant characteristic of all American history'. He, therefore, believed that film was vital to America's cultural identity.|$|R
50|$|The KS 150 reactor was {{designed}} in the Soviet Union and built entirely in Czechoslovakia, by Škoda Works. This type of reactor had never been deployed before. One advantage of the design <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use unenriched uranium mined in Czechoslovakia, similar to a CANDU reactor.|$|R
25|$|Another huge {{advantage}} of the liquid core <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> release xenon gas which normally acts as a neutron absorber and causes structural occlusions in solid fuel elements (leading to early replacement of solid fuel rods with over 98% of the nuclear fuel unburned, including many long lived actinides). In contrast Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) are capable of retaining the fuel mixture for significantly extended periods, which not only increases fuel efficiency dramatically, but also incinerates {{the vast majority of}} its own waste as part of the normal operational characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's psychology, {{given in}} his {{treatise}} On the Soul (peri psyche, often {{known by its}} Latin title De Anima), posits three kinds of soul ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> receive forms of other things and compare them.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{multiple}} solutions {{exist for}} such non-linear warping procedures, and to balance appropriately between the potentially opposing requirements for global and local shape fit, ever more sophisticated registration algorithms are being developed. Most of these, however, are computationally expensive if applied with a high-resolution grid. The biggest advantage of DBM {{with respect to}} VBM <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> detect subtle changes in longitudinal studies. However, due to the vast variety of registration algorithms, no widely accepted standard for DBM exists, which also prevented its incorporation into major neuroimaging software packages.|$|E
5000|$|The ERA {{has several}} {{interesting}} features. Most prominent <b>are</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> 'walk' around {{the exterior of}} the Russian segments of the station under its own control, moving hand-over-hand between pre-fixed basepoints, and <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform many tasks automatically or semi-automatically, thereby freeing its operators to do other work. Specific tasks of ERA include: ...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{uric acid}} (UA) has been {{associated}} with increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, the causal mechanisms linking elevated UA levels to cardio-metabolic diseases are still unsettled.

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the process <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems, which is important for workpieces that have a hardness greater than HRC 40. Note that there still is some embrittlement of the workpiece. While this process does not cause problems with hydrogen embrittlement, and electroplating does, it still offers equivalent corrosion protection. There is a great cost savings in using mechanical plating over electroplating on hardened workpieces, because the electroplating processes requires a pre- and post-plating operation to overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems. Moreover, because mechanical plating occurs at room temperature there is no tempering of hardened workpieces.|$|E
25|$|The Contessa 32 is {{seaworthy}} {{enough for}} offshore voyages in extreme weather conditions, but also performs well in races, {{and as a}} one-design racing class is administered by an active Association. The trait most often associated with the Contessa 32 though <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> endure harsh weather and rough seas. A Contessa 32 was the only yacht in the small boat class to finish the disastrous 1979 Fastnet race, in which 15 lives were lost. Production by the Jeremy Rogers boatyard ceased in 1982, then restarted in 1996 and still continues. The qualities and long production span of the Contessa have given the yacht a dedicated 'cult' following.|$|E
25|$|Oiceoptoma noveboracense is {{a member}} of the family Silphidae, or carrion beetles, which feed on {{decaying}} organic matter such as dead animals. Its common name is the margined carrion beetle, from the orange-red margins on the pronotum, which are helpful when identifying this species. The larva is typically light brown to red and also has vertical ridges on its thorax like the adult. This diurnal beetle can be found mainly in the spring into the fall, and it has a strong preference towards a deciduous forest habitat. The primary forensic importance of this beetle <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use the succession of insect fauna to provide confirmation of postmortem intervals.|$|E
40|$|Carnosine {{and related}} dipeptides have been have been {{postulated}} to have numerous biological roles including pH buffering, regulation of enzyme activity, and inhibition of oxidative reactions. Among antioxi-dant mechanisms reported for carnosine <b>are</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inactivate reactive oxygen species, scavenge free radi-cals, and chelate prooxidative metals [1 - 4]. A rather unusual reported antioxidant property of carnosine <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reduced concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) when added to previ-ously oxidized lipids [1, 4]. A potential mechanism for this observation {{would be the}} <b>ability</b> of carnosine <b>to</b> interact with aldehydic lipid oxidation products through Schiff base or Michael addition-type reactions. If carno-sine could interact with aldehydic lipid oxidation prod-ucts, this could potentially help protect biological tissues from oxidation, since aldehydes can form adducts with DNA, proteins, enzymes, and lipoproteins, causing alterations in their biological activity...|$|R
50|$|The Multiface 3, {{released}} in November 1987, {{was designed for}} the later Amstrad-made models of Spectrum that the 128 did not support. It existed in two versions; one with a 'thru-port', for £49.95, and one without, which cost £44.95. Both were later reduced to £29.95. The main feature of the Multiface 3 <b>was</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> save to +3 disk, a useful feature for +3 owners who wanted to avoid the long loading times of tapes.|$|R
