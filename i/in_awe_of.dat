5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Salih quickly {{gained the}} {{allegiance}} {{of the entire}} body of Kilab, who were <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his escape, and moved against Aleppo. Mansur's ghilmān staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmān, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighborhoods, including many Christians and Jews. On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.|$|E
25|$|It is Christmas Eve. Family {{and friends}} have {{gathered}} in the parlor to decorate the beautiful Christmas tree {{in preparation for the}} party. Once the tree is finished, the children are sent for. They stand <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the tree sparkling with candles and decorations.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his second}} {{win in the}} UFC, he faced Matt Hughes at UFC 50 for the vacant UFC Welterweight Championship. Despite a {{competitive}} performance against the much more experienced fighter, St-Pierre tapped out to an armbar with only 10 seconds remaining in the first round. The loss {{was the first of}} St-Pierre's career and he has since admitted that he was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> Hughes going into the title bout.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{his role as}} founder of the Levites, Levi {{is referred to as}} being particularly pious. The Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars attribute to a period just before the deuteronomist, speaks about Levi via an allegorical comparison to Moses himself, which hagaddah take to support the characterisation of Levi (and his progeny) as being by far the greatest of his brothers in respect to piety. The apocryphal Prayer of Asenath, which textual scholars believe dates from some time after the first century AD (scholarship in regards to the dating is currently quite contentious, with dates ranging from near the first century, to the fourth or fifth centuries), describes Levi as a prophet and saint, able to forecast the future, understand heavenly writings (astrology? weather trends?), and someone who admonishes the people to be forgiving, as well as <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> God. The Book of Malachi argues that the Levites were chosen by Yahweh to be the priests, because Levi as minister of God, was specified only the true religious regulations, was reverent, revered Yahweh, was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the God's name, upheld peace, was a model of good morality, and turned many people from sin.|$|E
25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E

25|$|They came fifth for a {{third time}} in four years in 1979, with the {{following}} four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain George Peponis, the Bulldogs disposed of Cronulla, Wests and Parramatta to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his genius. St George won the Grand Final 17-13 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17-2 at the break.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{music critic}} Anthony Tommasini, who ranked Schubert as the fourth {{greatest}} composer, wrote of him:You {{have to love}} the guy, who died at 31, ill, impoverished and neglected except by a circle of friends who were <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his genius. For his hundreds of songs alone – including the haunting cycle Winterreise, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences – Schubert is central to our concert life.... Schubert's first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the Unfinished and especially the Great C major Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Cajamarca, Pizarro sent an embassy, led by Hernando de Soto, with 15 {{horsemen}} and an interpreter; {{shortly thereafter}} he sent 20 more horsemen led {{by his brother}} Hernando Pizarro as reinforcements {{in case of an}} Inca attack. Atahualpa was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> these men dressed in full clothing, with long beards and riding horses (an animal he had never seen). In town Pizzaro set a trap for the Inca and the Battle of Cajamarca began. The Inca forces greatly out numbered the Spanish; however, the Spanish superiority of weapons and tactics {{and the fact that the}} most trusted Inca generals were in Cusco led to an easy defeat and the capture of the Incan Emperor.|$|E
60|$|It chanced that Mr. Carter two {{or three}} days later was dining with the Watsons, and the {{sketches}} were shown him. The following morning he sent for Philip. Philip saw him seldom and stood <b>in</b> some <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|R

25|$|The {{composition}} of the opposing armies explains {{a lot about the}} outcome of the ensuing conflict. The Tibetan soldiers were almost all rapidly impressed peasants, who lacked organisation, discipline, training and motivation. Only a handful of their most devoted units, comprising monks armed usually with swords and jingals, proved to be effective, but they were in such small numbers as to be unable to reverse the tide of battle. This problem was exacerbated by their generals, who seemed <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the British and refused to make any aggressive moves against the small and often dispersed column. They also failed conspicuously to properly defend their natural barriers, frequently offering battle in relatively open ground, where Maxim guns and rifle volleys caused great numbers of casualties.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} reviews given by European {{observers}} to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by westerners) {{and led by}} Ma Clique Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions. The 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army), trained entirely in China without any European help, was composed of Chinese Muslims and fought and severely mauled an invading Soviet Russian army during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damanged the superior Russian force.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was {{by any standard}} extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, {{but the question of}} how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since {{he did not want to}} be accused of nepotism.|$|E
60|$|These—the {{two most}} originative and most {{progressive}} races of Europe—had a faith <b>in,</b> an <b>awe</b> <b>of,</b> the supposed or real {{wisdom of the}} men of old time, which was often exaggerated into a superstition; but never—thanks to their own innate force—degenerated into a bondage.|$|R
60|$|Mr Merevale always rather {{enjoyed his}} {{straight}} {{talks with the}} Headmaster. Unlike most of his colleagues he stood <b>in</b> no <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> him whatever. He always found him ready to listen to sound argument, and, what was better, willing to be convinced. It was so in this case.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is never}} {{explicitly}} indicated whether he's a Nazi sympathizer. He is, however, <b>in</b> utter <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> {{all aspects of}} German lifestyle.

25|$|A banquet {{was soon}} held in Han's honor for this success. During this banquet, Han met his future wife, Liang Hongyu. Liang Hongyu was a {{military}} courtesan and was serving the officers in the banquet. It is said that Liang {{caught the eye of}} Han who was sighing instead of celebrating like the others. Liang approached Han and asked him why he wasn't showing any signs of joy in the banquet which was thrown in his honor. Han replied that this was a small victory and that he was worried about the Jurchens who showed signs of hostility to the Song regime. He stated that it hurt him to imagine the damage that war may bring upon the peasants. Liang was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> Han, and the two quickly become very close to each another. Liang decided to follow Han and the two soon were married.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his {{favourite}} Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum. Ron is {{even more}} excited when Krum, still {{a student at the}} Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts {{to take part in the}} Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe. However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 2006, President Chen {{met with}} Taiwanese Muslims {{who had just}} come back from Saudi Arabia for {{performing}} the Hajj pilgrimage in January 2006. He said that Taiwan needs to have some of the Islamic spirit of standing <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the supreme God, upholding peace and justice, helping the weak and poor, promoting social stability, being content with what one is and working hard. The President urged Taiwanese Muslims to introduce the doctrine and spirit of Islam to their compatriots to enhance exchanges between the Muslim societies and other sectors in Taiwan. He also expressed government's concern for the Islamic development to promote religious harmony and added that the government always pays great attention to religious development and encourages all religions in Taiwan to communicate with one another to promote mutual tolerance and respect and to serve as a driving force for stability, peace and prosperity. He stressed that any minority religion in Taiwan is respected and enjoys full protection under the law.|$|E
60|$|Azim {{had already}} sent two disciples {{to summon the}} Turk to the {{presence}} of the Grand Marabout, and in due time he appeared--a rough, heavy, truculent fellow enough, but making awkward salaams as one <b>in</b> great <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the presence <b>in</b> which he stood--unwilling <b>awe</b> perhaps--full <b>of</b> superstitious fear tempered by pride--for the haughty Turks revolted against homage to one of the subject race of Moors.|$|R
5000|$|Ian Peebles, {{who played}} under Haig at Middlesex, said of him: [...] "He had a witty and active mind, with {{interests}} ranging from bird watching {{to music and}} poetry.

60|$|The Vicomtesse stood <b>in</b> small <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> her husband, but his {{judgment}} upon {{a point of}} honour was a matter {{that she would not}} dare contest. She was ministering to the still prostrate Chevalier who, I think, remained prostrate now that he might continue to make appeal to her sympathy--when suddenly she cut in upon Roxalanne's defence of me.|$|R
500|$|In 1969, Nilsson's album Harry {{ended with}} one of Newman's songs: [...] "Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear". Years later, Nilsson told Paul Zollo that he was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> Newman writing so many songs, ones he thought were better than his own.|$|E
500|$|Hergé also {{declared}} Mark Twain an influence, {{although this}} admiration {{may have led}} him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in Prisoners of the Sun, an error T.F.
