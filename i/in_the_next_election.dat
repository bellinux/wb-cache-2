5|$|In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some {{of their}} lost {{popularity}} {{in one of the}} closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E
5|$|In the Khaki Election of 1900, {{nationalist}} {{concern with}} the Boer War meant that the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British Labour Party in 1906, with Keir Hardie as its first chairman. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name Unionist Party in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Season 3 {{begins with}} Underwood's {{presidency}} {{off to a}} rocky start: six months into his term, he is unpopular with the public, and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward. He plans to secure his legacy with an ambitious jobs bill, America Works, but the Democratic Congressional leadership refuses to support it; they also tell him {{that they will not}} support him if he seeks the presidential nomination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> He nominates Claire for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, but her nomination is defeated after she makes a gaffe during a Senate nomination hearing.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 2017, during <b>the</b> 5th bi-annual Conference of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, Akhil Gogoi {{announced}} that the party would contest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections</b> from 1983 to 1987, he {{was elected}} with 54.72% of the vote {{compared}} to 14.32% for Popular Alliance (the current Partido Popular).|$|R
50|$|Halpert {{was first}} elected to <b>the</b> Knesset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1981 {{elections}} on the Agudat Israel list. However, he lost his seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 1984.|$|R
5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for a victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{his party}} {{merged with the}} VLD, which entered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections</b> as Open VLD. He was elected {{as a member of}} <b>the</b> Belgian Senate <b>in</b> 2007.|$|R
50|$|When Eligio Ayala renounced the {{presidency}} on March 17, 1924, Riart {{took charge of}} the government until August 15, and afterwards presented himself as candidate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
50|$|A small {{economically}} right-wing {{party with}} the same name, Young Finns, was established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s and gained two seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Parliament, but lost them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted they vote for dry laws or face defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election</b> by dry voters.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in {{a period}} of {{rebuilding}} and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring, and the Schutzstaffel (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the party only obtained twelve seats out of an available 491. Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election,</b> the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag. In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{ended in}} 11th place overall, {{receiving}} 6,555 votes nationwide out of over 125 million cast. He thus missed, {{by a large}} margin, the 5 percent needed to qualify the Socialist Party USA for federally distributed public funding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> His best showings were in Tennessee, where he received 1,326 votes out of over 2 million votes cast, and in Ohio, where he managed to receive 2,731 votes. His weakest showings were in Kentucky and Minnesota, where he managed to gain 7 votes in each state. Moore {{was not able to}} enlarge the party's voter base, but instead the voter base shrunk by over 4 thousand votes nationwide from the previous election fronted by Walt Brown.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the party}} was {{defeated}} by the Bulgarian Union of Banat-Romania <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000 elections, losing its seat. It subsequently failed to regain parliamentary representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 2004.|$|R
50|$|During 1996 Assembly elections, {{a record}} 1033 {{candidates}} contested the Modakurachi Assembly seat. To check {{a repeat of}} this, the Election Commission increased the security deposit amount <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 2001, <b>the</b> 69-year-old Chibirov {{received}} less than 20% of the votes, while Stanislav Kochiev {{came in second}} with 25%, and the 38-year-old Eduard Kokoity (Kokoyev) won with more than 48% of the vote.|$|R
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by the new constitution was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the new constitution mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The new constitution also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{chairman}} of the state's Republican Party, McNary campaigned to get the Republican presidential nominee, Charles Evans Hughes, elected in the 1916 presidential election. Hughes, a former US Supreme Court justice and future chief justice, carried Oregon but lost the presidency to the incumbent, Woodrow Wilson. When US Senator Harry Lane died in office, on May 23, 1917, it created an opportunity for McNary to redeem himself after his failed bid for election to the Oregon Supreme Court. McNary was among several possible successors considered by Oregon Governor James Withycombe. The governor preferred someone who supported national women's suffrage and Prohibition, and he shared with McNary an interest in farming. Furthermore, McNary supporters argued that both progressive and conservative factions of the Republican Party would accept McNary and that unity would give the party {{the best chance of}} retaining the Senate seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> Withycombe appointed McNary to the unexpired term on May 29.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election</b> in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.|$|E
