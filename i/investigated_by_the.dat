5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham {{during most}} of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.|$|E

A slice of pizza {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{launched a}} crackdown against {{a number of}} civil society organisations. Several {{tens of thousands of}} organisations were <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E

5|$|The TV rights {{agreement}} between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, {{and a number of}} court cases have arisen as a result. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.

5|$|The idea of deporting Polish Jews to Madagascar was <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Polish {{government}} in 1937, but {{the task force}} sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 families could be accommodated, or even as few as 500 families by some estimates. Because efforts by the Nazis to encourage the emigration of the Jewish population of Germany before World War II were only partially successful, the idea of deporting Jews to Madagascar was revived by the Nazi {{government in}} 1940.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to time {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, and were <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E

5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1973, Agnew was <b>investigated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States Attorney for the District of Maryland on {{suspicion}} of conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew had accepted payments from contractors during his time as a Maryland official, and the payments had continued into his time as vice president. After denying his guilt for months, Agnew negotiated a plea agreement that would involve his resignation from office. On October 10, 1973, Agnew pled no contest to a single felony charge of tax evasion, resigned his office, {{and was replaced by}} House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances. He wrote a novel, and also a memoir defending his actions. He died in 1996.|$|E
