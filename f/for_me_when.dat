They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> no one else was").|$|E

However, before I take this opportunity to thank the many people who have made this thesis possible. I must first apologize to my grandparents to whom I bear the guilt of not been able to fulfill my duties as a grandson. I must gratefully acknowledge my parents <b>for</b> providing <b>me</b> with the opportunity to pursue my selfish endeavours and to my mother for her quiet, everyday support that enabled me to focus on writing my thesis. I must reserve the bulk of my gratitude for my friends Elise, Alister, Ken, Laurence, Jon, Jaq, Bao and Huiming whose friendship, empathy and understanding continues to transcend both time and geography. I must thank my friends in Sydney <b>for</b> keeping <b>me</b> alive and sane.

25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E

A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me.

500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 71 through Sonnet 74 {{are often}} grouped {{together}} as a linear sequence due to their dark, brooding tone, and The Poet's obsession with his own mortality and legacy.

2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} victory, McClellan {{was shaken}} by the experience.

Victory has no charms <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> purchased at such cost." [...] He redeployed all of his army except for the V Corps south of the river, and although he continued to plan for a siege and the capture of Richmond, he lost the strategic initiative. An offensive begun by the new Confederate commander, Gen. Robert E. Lee, would be planned while the Union troops passively sat in the outskirts of Richmond. The Seven Days Battles of June 25 through July 1, 1862, drove the Union Army back to the James River and saved the Confederate capital.|$|E
2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Seder is {{a ritual}} {{performed}} by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling {{of the story of}} the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.

[...] The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: [...] "You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> I came out of Egypt.'" [...] (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient work derived from the Mishnah (Pesahim 10). The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, commentaries from the Talmud, and special Passover songs.|$|E

2500|$|Rabban Gamaliel {{said that}} one needed to mention three things on Passover to {{discharge}} one's duty: the Passover offering, unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah), and bitter herbs (maror). The Passover offering was sacrificed because God passed over the Israelites' houses in Egypt. They ate unleavened bread because the Israelites were redeemed from Egypt. And they ate bitter herbs because the Egyptians embittered {{the lives of the}} Israelites in Egypt. In every generation, all were bound to regard themselves as though they personally had gone out of Egypt, because [...] says, [...] "You shall tell your child in that day: ‘It is because of what the Lord did <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> I came out of Egypt.'" [...] Therefore, it was everyone's duty to thank and praise God for performing those miracles for the Israelites and their descendants.

Therefore, they were to say hallelujah! ...|$|E
