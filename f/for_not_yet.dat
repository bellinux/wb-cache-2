5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E

The PML-N's conservative hardliners also chose to blame the US and NATO for causing terrorism in Pakistan. The peace effort was encountering problems before it had ever really begun. The Pakistani Taliban's Supreme Council released demands for a cease-fire, to also include the release of all its imprisoned militants and the withdrawal of the Pakistani military from all tribal regions. Former and current government officials criticised Sharif <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> laying out a clear vision of how the country should handle its more than 40 militant groups, many of them made up of violent Islamic extremists.|$|E

So, having very blessedly this perch to come to, here I am while the air of superficial summer still reigns. London is agitating but interesting--in certain aspects I find it even quite uplifting--and the mere feeling that the huge burden of one's tension is shared is something of a relief, even if it does show the strain as so much reflected back to one. Immensely do I understand the need of younger men to take refuge from it in doing, for all they are worth--to be old and doddering now is for a male person not at all glorious. But if to feel, with consuming passion, under the call of the great cause, is any sort of attestation of use, then I contribute my fond vibration.... During these few days in town I have seen almost no one, and this London, which is, to the eye, immensely full of people (I mean of the sort who are not here usually at this season,) is also a strange, rather sinister London in the sense that [...] "social intercourse" [...] seems (and most naturally) scarcely to exist. I'm afraid that even your salon, were you here, would inevitably become more or less aware of the shrinkage. Let that console you a little <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> setting it up. Dear little ---- I shall try to see--I grieve deeply over her complication of horrors. We all have the latter, but some people (and those the most amiable and most innocent) seem to have them with an extra devilish twist. Not [...] "sweets" [...] to the sweet now, but a double dose of bitterness. It's all a huge strain and a huge nightmare and a huge unspeakability--but that isn't my last word or my last sense. This great country has found, and is still more finding, certain parts of herself again that had seemed for long a good deal lost. But here they are now--magnificent; and we haven't yet seen a quarter of them. The whole will press down the scale of fortune. What we all are together (in our so unequal ways) [...] "out for" [...] we shall do, through thick and thin and whatever enormity of opposition. We sufficiently want to and we sufficiently can--both by material and volition. Therefore if we don't achieve, it will only be because we have lost our essential, our admirable, our soundest and roundest identity--and that is simply inconceivable to your faithful and affectionate old ...|$|E
