25|$|Yorkshire {{never managed}} to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a {{relatively}} easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis served up some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> matter much – Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked them off to book Hampshire's place in the C Trophy final.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Knowledge {{about the}} {{influence}} of current neuroprotective interventions after sur-vival of cardiac arrest is lacking. AIM: To investigate the effects of mild therapeutic hypothermia on the release of the astroglial protein S- 100 post CPR in survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: Prospective, observational study during a two year period, involving medical emergen-cy services and five collaborating hospitals at the city of Aachen. 70 patients were enrolled by the emergency physician on duty by taking blood samples after successful attempt of resuscitation with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), followed by samples at baseline, 6, 24 and 120 hours post ROSC by the appropriate intensive care unit. Patients were tracked for estimating mortality and gross neurological outcome for 14 days. RESULTS: S- 100 levels in patients not receiving mild therapeutic hypothermia (NT) showed equiv-alent numbers as compared to cooled patients (MTH) on baseline and did not reach statistical significance on any other timepoint. S- 100 levels on baseline were significantly lower in patients with a good neurological outcome at 14 days after the event in comparison to their peers with adverse outcome (p= 0. 017). While the difference in S- 100 levels of MTH Patients with adverse or favourable neurological outcome reached statistical significance at timepoint 24 h and 120 h (p< 0, 05), <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not in <b>NT</b> patients at any timepoint. CONCLUSIONS: MTH had no influence on S- 100 serum levels in survivors of nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the particular setting of this investigation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Th e ABO {{blood group}} {{system is the}} most {{important}} in transfusion medicine. O blood group is common in Chinese Han people, but the distribution of various O alleles is unknown. Sequences of exon 6 and exon 7 of the O allele at the ABO gene locus were studied in 100 individuals of the O phenotype randomly selected from the Chinese Han population. Some samples, when required, were cloned and sequenced spanning exon 6 and exon 7. Eight O alleles were found in the Chinese population. Most have the 2 common O 01 or O 02 alleles. Th e allele frequency of ABO*O 01 was 0. 47, and that of ABO*O 02 was 0. 495. One individual was found to have O 05 allele. Five alleles were found to diff er from all alleles reported to date. Four of these alleles diff ered from either the O 01 allele (1 out of 4) or O 02 allele (3 out of 4) by 1 point mutation at A 468 G, G 489 A, T 526 C, or T 1104 G. Th e fi fth allele diff ered from the O 01 allele since <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have <b>nt</b> 261 G deletion but has C 467 T mutation. Th is novel allele occurred in 2 individuals. O genetic analysis suggests that the O 01 allele prevails, with O 1 v accounting for about 97 % of these in the Chinese Han population. Th e O 03 allele that has been shown to occur with a frequency of < 5 % in other populations was not detected. But the novel O allele without 261 G deletion has been found in Chinese for the fi rst time. Surely more O alleles will be found in the Chinese population...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented for the isogeometric Boundary Element analysis of domains that contain predefine dinclusions with material properties {{that are different}} {{to the rest of}} the domain and which also may exhibit inelastic behavior. The paper is complementary to a paper published recently in this journal, which focused on plane problems. The theoretical framework and implementation are extended to three-dimensional problems here. In our approach the geometry of inclusions is described using NURBS surfaces. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization into cells is required, in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The implementation is verifie <b>do</b> <b>ntest</b> cases by comparison with either exact solutions or ones computed by the Finite Element method...|$|R

40|$|Sensitivity to 6 -n-propylthiouracil (PROP) tasting predicts {{sensitivity}} to food qualities {{as well as}} rejection of some strong tasting foods. Using consumer rejection threshold (CRT) method, this study aimed to assess whether systematic changes in the taste intensities of familiar foods would lead to earlier rejection of these products by PROP tasters than by PROP non-tasters. Subjects rated the intensity of PROP solution and were divided into tasters (Ts) and non-tasters (NTs). And Ts were further divided into medium-tasters (MTs) and super-tasters (STs). Difference thresholds and CRTs were then evaluated for caffeine in coffee, citric acid in orange juice, and for NaCl in beef soup. For each food, Ts were more sensitive to variations in tastants than NTs. Ts also rejected more bitter coffee, more sour orange juice, and less salty beef soup more readily than <b>did</b> <b>NTs.</b> Comparisons among NTs, MTs, and STs gave fewer clear differences...|$|R

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} colony-stimulating factor (CSF) {{have recently been}} described in human tissues and cultured cell lines. Antisera to purified type I and II CSF were prepared in rabbits. Anti-CSF I antibody inhibits CSF I, but {{has no effect on}} CSF II. It cross-inhibits CSF I from several other human sources, but does not inhibit CSF from mouse lung or mouse L cells. Anti-CSF II antibody inhibits the activity of CSF II, but has no effect on CSF I. A radioimmunoassay for CSF I has been established. Competitive binding assay further demonstrated the immunological differences between CSF I and II. When CSF II is used to stimulate human marrow cells fractionated by sedimentation velocity, two populations of CFU-C are separated, one sedimenting at 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 7, and a second sedimenting at 6. 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 13. In contrast, CSF I <b>does</b> <b>nt</b> stimulate colony growth by day 7 but does do so by day 13 in cells sedimenting between 7. 2 - 8. 5 mm/h. These results indicate that CSF I and II are distinct in their biochemical, immunological, and functional properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (NT) {{in the control}} of thymocyte proliferation has been investigated in vivo in the immature rat. For this task, we have studied {{the effects of the}} administration of selective antagonists of the receptors of the three neuropeptides on the mitotic index (% of metaphase-arrested cells after vincristin injection) of thymocytes. Both CCK- and TN-receptor antagonists were ineffective. In contrast, two VIP receptor antagonists (VIP-As) enhanced the mitotic index of thymocytes. VIP reversed the effect of VIP-As, but when administered alone <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not alter the mitotic activity of thymocytes. In light of these findings, we conclude that endogenous VIP exerts a maximal tonic inhibitory influence on the basal proliferative activity of rat thymocytes, while endogenous CCK and <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not play a relevant modulatory role in this process...|$|R
