40|$|Efficient asset {{management}} {{is a key}} performance driver for asset-intensive organizations. Achieving high utilization and return on investment on physical assets are central corporate objectives for public and private organisations alike. Current approaches on {{asset management}} include the engineering and governance perspectives. Both perspectives offer valuable but incomplete insights on the management of asset performance: experience demonstrates that an exclusive focus on {{one or the other}} may lead to sub-optimal asset and organizational performance. In this paper, we investigate how an integrated approach to asset management can be constructed in the context of vehicle fleets. Beginning with an analysis of how the asset management process is operated through the asset lifecycle, we identify key engineering and organizational factors influencing asset performance. The relationships between factors are analyzed to provide an integrated <b>fleet</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> approach...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work at the}} University of Minnesota Duluth on <b>fleet</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> {{determined}} a key shortcoming in {{life cycle}} costing analysis was the poor quality of available data. Automation of data acquisition was recommended to minimize errors inherent in manual data collection and data entry. This project investigates the feasibility of collecting data from engine computers on board Class 330 and 350 snowplows and wirelessly transmitting these data directly into the Maximus M 5 maintenance information system. Wireless modems were evaluated to select models that could function in the physical setting and temperature conditions of northern Minnesota. One modem met all the criteria and was field-tested in several different snowplow units. The modem functioned, but the interface with the on-board computer prevented data transfer due to embedded proprietary software by the engine manufacturers. Third party providers do offer real-time remote data collection from engine computers. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) expressed concern over data protection and cost with this approach, so alternative management strategies were developed. Under these conditions, the recommendation {{is to increase the}} frequency of cable-acquired data from the engines and implement best practices for data acquisition.

40|$|Faghri, ArdeshirThere {{are many}} {{factors in the}} {{decision}} making process which, when taken into account, lend themselves to a reasonable fleet management approach that is both robust and sustainable in a dynamic and technologically rich environment. The {{work in this area}} falls under the general area of Transportation Engineering with a more broad connection to Civil Engineering. ☐ Traditionally, the process used by public transportation entities to determine the acquisition strategy for new vehicle asset is based upon a broad range of criteria. Vehicle cost has been cited as one of the more critical factors which decision makers consider. It is currently a common practice to consider other factors that contribute to a more comprehensive approach. Some of these other factors are as follows: 1. life-cycle cost, fuel efficiency 2. Vehicle reliability 3. Environmental effects ☐ Although federal agencies, e. g. Federal Transit Administration (FTA), have published several reports investigating and comparing alternative fuel buses, those reports do not directly suggest which technology is a dominant choice for a specific state. (Shahpar, 2010) ☐ The determination of the most appropriate alternative fuel bus asset for a given application is not necessarily that straight forward. The typical bus fleet is developed over a broad time horizon with each asset being acquired to meet a certain agency need or to close a perceived gap in the delivery of public transportation service. Therefore; as new assets are considered, it is critical for the fleet manager to consider as many factors of the fleet infrastructure to better ensure the positive impact that the newly acquired asset will have on fleet performance relative to the overall service goals and objectives of the fleet. ☐ This study investigates a broad range of alternative-fuel bus technologies and the associated factors that will inform the decision making process. Further, this work utilizes the inventory and understanding of the range of technology factors and leverages the perspective (knowledge) of industry experts on each of these factors to develop an expert systems decision making philosophy to aid in the adoption of industry standards, best practices, consistency and sustainability in <b>fleet</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> over time. ☐ This study investigates what I believe is the next generation of advancements in decision making tools {{in the area of the}} application of methods to quantify and manage uncertainty. In particular, the uncertainty that comes from the public policy arena where future policy and regulations are not always based upon logical and predictable processes. The fleet decision making process in most governmental agencies is a very complex and interdependent activity. There are always competing forces and agendas within the view of the decision maker. Rarely is the decision maker a single person although, within the transit environment, there is often one person charged with the responsibility of fleet management. ☐ The focus of this research examines the decision making of the general transit agency community via the development of an expert systems prototype tool based upon the Exsys Corvid® software platform. The platform has been selected for its broad capability in capturing expert decision making knowledge and data in an easy to understand user applicable format. ☐ A computer-based prototype system is developed, within the Exsys Corvid® environment, which provide an expert knowledge-based recommendation, based upon variable user inputs. The results shown in this study show that a decision making tool for the management of transit system alternate fuel vehicle assets can be modeled and tested. ☐ The direct user of this research are the transit agency administrations. The results can be used by the management teams as a reliable input to inform their urban transit buses expansion decision making process.

40|$|The growing {{recognition}} amongst local authorities {{of the potential}} of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> to improve property management practice has led to its increased adoption. The growing trend has been supported {{by the development of}} <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> frameworks. However, evidence indicates that local authorities are failing to achieve the full benefits from their <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> implementation. The factors contributing to some of the property management problems such as reactive management, lack of leadership support, ineffective corporate landlord approach, remain. The available frameworks are incapable of mitigating the identified problems by failing to provide understanding of local authority differences. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an adaptable and flexible operational property <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> framework for local authorities in England and Scotland. The strategic management theory, review of existing literature findings and evaluation of available <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> frameworks especially the Total <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> Process model helped to identify, define and establish the causal logic of the <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> concepts underpinning the developed conceptual framework. Face to face semi-structured interviews followed by large scale questionnaire surveys were used to gather primary data. The key research findings are that the following are the key factors limiting <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> practice improvements in local authorities: ineffective leadership support, <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> capabilities and corporate landlord approach; inadequate <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> information systems and performance management arrangements. Principal components factor analysis was utilised to help establish underlying factors that account for flexible and adaptable <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> framework.
