5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the optics of <b>the</b> {{mammalian}} <b>eye</b> is to bring a clear image of the visual world onto the retina. Because of limited depth of field of <b>the</b> mammalian <b>eye,</b> an object at one distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> might project a clear image, while an object either closer to or further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> will not. To make images clear for objects at different distances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> its optical power needs to be changed. This is accomplished mainly by changing the curvature of the lens. For distant objects, the lens {{needs to be made}} flatter; for near objects the lens needs to be made thicker and more rounded.|$|R

5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> made two stars.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of the game's protagonist. The player controls {{the movement of the}} player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are strepsirrhine primates; {{the four}} species {{comprise}} the genus Phaner. Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, {{where they are}} found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> converge {{on the top of}} the head, and run down the back as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

40|$|When a rigid object {{moves toward}} <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> {{it is usually}} {{perceived}} as being rigid. However, {{in the case of}} motion away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>the</b> motion and structure of the object are perceived nonveridically, with the percept tending to reflect the nonrigid transformations that are present in the retinal image. This difference in response to motion to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> observer was quantified in an experiment using wire-frame computer-generated boxes which moved toward and away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Two theoretical systems are developed by which uniform three-dimensional velocity can be recovered from an expansion pattern of nonuniform velocity vectors. It is proposed that the human visual system uses two similar systems for processing motion in depth. The mechanism used for motion away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> produces perceptual errors because it is not suited to objects with a depth component...|$|R

The herb causes irritation of mucous membranes. When ingested, the irritation of the mucosal membranes of the stomach and intestines will cause nausea and vomiting. If the herb is introduced to the nose, this mucosal irritation will cause sneezing and coughing. Ingestion can also cause bradycardia (slow heart rate), hyperactivity, and hypotension (low blood pressure). In high concentrations, topical contact can cause skin irritation, excessive tears <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and redness.|$|E
