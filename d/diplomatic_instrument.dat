Diderot's simplicity and vehemence were as conspicuous and as unrestrained at Tsarskoe-selo as at Grandval or the Rue Taranne. If {{for a moment the}} torrent of his improvisation was checked by the thought that he was talking to a great lady, Catherine encouraged him to go on. [...] "Allons," [...] she cried, [...] "entre hommes tout est permis." [...] The philosopher in the heat of exposition brought his hands down upon the imperial knees with such force and iteration, that Catherine complained that he made them black and blue. She was sometimes glad to seek shelter from such zealous enforcement of truth, behind a strong table. Watchful diplomatists could not doubt that such interviews must have reference to politics. Cathcart, the English ambassador, writes to his government that M. Diderot is still with the Empress at Tsarskoe-selo, [...] "pursuing his political intrigues." [...] And, amazing as it may seem, the French minister and the French ambassador both of them believed that they had found in this dreaming rhapsodical genius a useful <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instrument.</b> [...] "The interviews between Catherine and Diderot follow one another incessantly, and go on from day to day. He told me, and I have reasons for believing that he is speaking the truth, that he has painted the danger of the alliance of Russia with the King of Prussia, and the advantage of an alliance with us. The Empress, far from blaming this freedom, encouraged him by word and gesture. 'You are not fond of that prince,' she said to Diderot. 'No,' he replied, 'he is a great man, but a bad king, and a dealer in counterfeit coin.' 'Oh,' said she laughing, 'I have had my share of his coin.'" ...|$|E

In order to achieve this, UN <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments</b> that included <b>diplomatic</b> negotiations, UN Resolutions, sanctions, and weapons inspections have been rigorously analysed {{within the context of}} ascertaining their diplomatic effectiveness. The report specifically focuses on the impact that was made by the diplomatic tools in an effort to peacefully disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. In addition, the report explores factors that undermined the use of the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments.</b> A number of factors have been responsible for the failure of the UN diplomacy in Iraq. They include, among others, a structural problem in form of an enforcement mechanism in the UN Security Council Resolutions; lack of complementarity {{in the use of the}} <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments,</b> and implemented at an earlier phase of the disarmament crisis; use of the UN by some of its key members to pursue their interests; flaws in the overall US/UN policy toward Iraq; deeply entrenched hostilities between Iraq and the West especially US and Britain; the approach within which sanctions were modelled discouraged key diplomatic dialogue and negotiation; and the nature of the UN of being an association of sovereign countries largely limited diplomatic efforts to resolve the disarmament crisis.

Germany's Federal Foreign Office maintains eight strategic partnerships {{with a broad}} variety of partners. We analyse {{the problems associated with}} strategic partnerships, and offer a five-point proposal whereby Germany could finesse this instrument and use it more effectively. Given the highly divergent group of countries with which Germany maintains formalised strategic partnerships, {{there is a lack of}} clarity as to what a strategic partnership entails. Whereas actual {{bilateral relations}} differ greatly from country to country, two key elements characterise almost all of Germany's strategic partners. They are located outside the transatlantic orbit and they play a growing or continuingly significant role in regional and global governance; many of Germany's partners are indispensable for the solution of 21 st century collective action problems. Germany could put this <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instrument</b> to more effective use: 1) focusing on "ability" and "will" (rather than a resort to moralization) 2) asking the question "which global public goods" is the partner country willing to provide 3) identifying clear red lines and abiding by them 4) building in an incentive structure based on "Reform for Responsibility" and 5) working in coalitions. Being more explicit about the purpose of individual strategic partnerships would make them a more viable <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instrument.</b> Our proposal suggests ways whereby Germany's strategic partnerships could be better targeted. ­Effective strategic partnerships could generate very high gains - not only for Germany, but for the world at large via the attention they pay to the joint provision of public goods, and everyone concerned with questions of global order...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibility}} of multilateral diplomacy, as an instrument, to advance women's rights in the realm of international relations. Multilateral diplomacy has proven to be an effective instrument for managing order and change in the international arena quite effectively. The United Nations, as an international organisation, provides a style of diplomatic interaction that is available for public scrutiny. Sensitive issues, such as the advancement of the status of women, have been prioritised on the global agenda and could be subsequently incorporated into the policies of participating states. The diversity of role players attending an international conference is another positive feature of multilateral diplomacy. By virtue of it's nature, multilateral diplomacy is therefore an effective instrument for focussing globally on the issue of women's rights. The position of women in international political theory is dealt with by theorists from various perspectives. The feminist theorists ensure that social and political debates on the authority, legitimacy, democracy and universal human rights are considered from a woman's perspective. Where women are and where they should be are two questions that are equally important and crucial to dealing with the advancement of women's rights on the global agenda. Global issues, such as war, have had a shift in perspective from security-awareness to humanitarian-awareness. In its partnership with civil society, the United Nations as a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instrument,</b> has become a voice for women internationally. The patriarchic system of apartheid in South Africa managed to entrench discrimination within its legislation based on both race and gender. A particular focus is the national machinery set up within South Africa to ensure that what was agreed on to at the international conferences makes a difference to the lives of women in South Africa. This paper intends to build on the existing body of knowledge currently available on the status of women in international relations theory. From a diplomatic perspective, it examines how the instrument of multilateral diplomacy has contributed to the advancement of women's rights. Thesis (MDips) [...] University of Pretoria, 2003.

40|$|In 1989, the Northeastern {{states of}} Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in the United States and the {{neighboring}} Canadian Provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia embarked upon {{a new form}} of regional marine environmental cooperation when their governors and premiers adopted the Agreement on Conservation of the Marine Environment of the Gulf of Maine Between the Governments of the Bordering States and Provinces. By doing so, they gave birth to an informal regime for the Gulf of Maine (GoM) (i. e. the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment), which to date has withstood the test of time. GoM regime participants undertake transboundary cooperation on the basis of shared ecosystem goals and objectives, as well as through the implementation of quinquennial Action Plans. In doing so, regime participants have effectively cooperated {{on the basis of a}} generally informal framework consisting of soft principles, understandings, and processes reflecting their mutual expectations in the regime’s issue areas. The GoM regime has been the subject of several scholarly reviews in recent years. Chircop et al. noted that the GoM regime: may be viewed as novel in at least three ways. First, the Agreement and Action Plan represent the first attempt to develop a broad regional marine environmental protection regime in North America.... Second, the Agreement is a provincial and state initiative, not a bilateral treaty between two sovereign nations. The Agreement, signed by the governors and premiers of the jurisdictions concerned, is neither a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instrument,</b> nor a formal document. It is, essentially, a non-binding, multilateral, political agreement and therefore the impetus to cooperate is moral, rather than as a result of any legal obligation or commitment. This is in contrast to most regional marine environmental arrangements... which involve countries, such as the 13 Regional Seas Programmes facilitated by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the regional agreements for the Baltic and North-East Atlantic. Third, the Agreement and Action Plan are not limited in coverage to marine waters but adopt an ecosystem approach covering coastal areas and watersheds in the region. The Agreement explicitly provides for consideration of “the shoreline, seabed, waters and associated natural resources of the GoM region, including Georges Bank and the Bay of Fundy. ” The GoM regime has persisted for two decades and has grown to address increasingly more issues. It has evolved to respond to a changing biophysical and socio-economic operating environment in a different manner from other regional environmental regimes, and continues to do so with the release of its fourth and latest Action Plan for the period 2007 - 2012. Against this backdrop, this Article is an assessment of the GoM regime, and further builds on the literature on the subject. This assessment is considered in the context of the GoM’s geography, hydrology, ecosystem, resources, and legal considerations, and the ecosystem challenges faced by the region. The origins and historical evolution of the regime are then set out, followed by a discussion of the main elements of the GoM regime. This assessment is an attempt at explaining the persistence of the GoM regime by offering insights into key factors that have contributed to its endurance, while at the same time raising important questions for future continuity and further growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{interdependence}} among role players {{is one of the}} most important characteristics of the global arena of the twenty first century. The downside of the creation of an integrated and knowledge-driven global society is the increased global inequality, poverty and environmental degradation. Insufficient scientific and technological knowledge to address these challenges {{is one of the most}} pressing concerns for the developing countries and emerging market economies of the global South. To increase their technological capabilities without incurring the costs of technological innovation, these countries use science and technology diplomacy to create new and participate in existing global networks for scientific information exchange. The countries of the South do not perceive themselves to be ‘borrowers’ or ‘adopters’ of ready-made technology but as active participants in the acquisition, generation and management of technological expertise. Developing countries and many emerging economies desperately need to level the global playing field by bridging the scientific and technological gap between them and developed countries. Different needs motivate a developed country, such as Germany to become involved in a bilateral diplomatic relationship with an emerging economy, such as South Africa. Germany aims to increase its access to South Africa’s markets, thereby creating more opportunities for trade and economic growth. South Africa experiences developmental challenges and has since 1994 actively created diplomatic opportunities to ensure the successful transmission of technology to its people. South Africa’s science and technology diplomacy takes place against the background of its national interests related to the transfer of technology to its people. South Africa recognised the necessity of diplomatic specialisation and therefore signed a bilateral science and technology agreement with Germany on 12 June 1996. The broad aim of this case study is to demonstrate how the science and technology diplomacy between Germany, a highly developed country in the global North and South Africa, an emerging economy in the global South, can be instrumental in addressing the developmental challenges of the latter. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to assess the significance of the scientific and technological diplomatic relationship between South Africa and Germany as manifested during the 2012 / 2013 German-South African Year of Science. The main research question is whether the 2012 / 2013 German-South African Year of Science contributed to South Africa’s ability to leverage scientific knowledge and technological skills from Germany. The first subsidiary question asks whether South Africa can use this Year of Science as a blueprint for similar partnerships with other countries. This leads to a second subsidiary question: What does the South African government need to do to establish a permanent, structural framework for the long-term inclusion of non-state role players in its science and technology diplomacy? The study finds the Year of Science to be a highlight, a success and in many aspects a blueprint for future cooperation with other countries. This Year of Science demonstrates what a good and dedicated partnership could offer. It strengthened and supported the already existing relations with various non-governmental stakeholders. This Year of Science served as a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instrument</b> for the inclusion of non-state role players for the promotion of science and technology agreements, the funding of scientific research and the exchange of scientific knowledge. This case study report contributes to the field of science and technology diplomacy in general, but also provides valuable insight in the changes South Africa will have to make to its strategies and policies to benefit more to improve its science and technology diplomacy.

40|$|This article explores defence {{diplomacy}} {{with reference}} to South Africa. Although {{the use of military}} means for diplomatic purposes is an established practice in South Africa, it is argued that as defence foreign relations, South African defence diplomacy approximates a military adjunct to diplomacy rather than a distinct type of diplomacy. At one level, its importance in a changing environment and use for foreign and security policy purposes are recognised in principle, whereas, at another level, defence diplomacy has become an overarching term for defence foreign relations. As a result, defence diplomacy does not receive the recognition it deserves. Conceptually, this is due less to the precarious relationship between various foreign policy instruments, and more to an underestimation of the nature, scope and utility of defence diplomacy. Practically, and due in part to conceptual ambiguity, this underestimation is reinforced by a lack of integration with foreign and defence policy and corresponding military policy and strategy, as well as by defence diplomacy being restricted to its military-defence policy context rather than enhanced by its diplomatic-foreign policy context. These conclusions are based on a brief exposition {{of the relationship between the}} military and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments</b> of foreign policy; an account of the nature and scope of defence diplomacy and related concepts; an overview of what accordingly constitutes South African defence diplomacy; and a concluding assessment and evaluation of its future prospects and constraints...|$|R

40|$|A {{sophisticated}} and high tech form of state-to-foreign population diplomacy {{based on the}} use of the latest communication technologies has developed rapidly in recent years and has acquired an increasingly important position within a significant number of foreign affairs systems. Pioneered by the heavyweights of the international stage, the phenomenon has spread rapidly to secondary powers and is progressively extending itself to varying degrees to all states around the globe. This thesis grapples with the enigma raised by the brisk re-emergence of this foreign policy concentration by attempting to understand the reasons behind both the quantitative increase in public diplomacy activities and the qualitative evolution of these activities in terms of planning, organisation and implementation. The first argument that this thesis broaches is that the sudden growth of public diplomacy is the result of the shift to a new phase of the information revolution (necessary enabling force) which has been amplified by contingent factors: the explosion of global terrorism (accelerator) and the perception of leaders and foreign policy makers of this new environment (prism). The second argument is that, beyond quantitative growth, the new operational context born of the advent of the global information society provoked a qualitative evolution of the public diplomacy inherited from the Cold War towards what is today mass diplomacy. The result is the appearance of a market driven diplomacy employing persuasive techniques borrowed from the world of public relations and marketing. The new diplomacy is an entrepreneurial diplomacy that limits governmental leadership to a necessary minimum and encourages the participation of private and foreign sub-contractors. It is also a cyber-space diplomacy equipped with new <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments</b> such as high-resolution satellite imagery, high-speed networks, digital broadcasting and other marvels of the late twentieth ce...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} case study {{on the relationship between}} language and power during a period when a series of institutions, ideas, and practices surfaced that transformed European society and significantly altered the manner in which rulers governed. The growth of bureaucracies within increasingly centralized monarchies, a gradual process of laicization, and the rapid spread of vernacular writing represent three of these major changes as well as the primary focus of this survey. In it, I analyze systematically what drove the thirteenth-century kings of the Crown of Aragon to begin writing in their realms' spoken vernaculars (Catalan and Aragonese), what these motivations reveal about contemporary mentalities and language ideologies, and how codeswitching (shifting from Latin to the romance and back) figured into the crown's overall governing practices. Using a multi-disciplinary approach that combines historical methodologies with theoretical frameworks from linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, and literary criticism, I conclude that the kings appropriated codeswitching strategies as <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments</b> in the administration of their realms. The practical impulse to reach a larger, Latin-illiterate audience influenced all vernacular writing at some level during the Middle Ages, including within the royal chancery. Yet, {{in the vast majority of}} cases the kings appropriated vernacular writing strategically as a symbolic instrument. In these instances, the switch from Latin to a vernacular language alone signaled a change in tone, usually denoting displeasure or urgency. Employing language as a political tool betrayed the kings' weakness rather than their strength. Like their contemporaries throughout Western Europe, the kings of the Crown of Aragon were in the initial stages of consolidating and expanding their power over a recalcitrant nobility through a combination of violence, better organized bureaucracies, and the support of urban elites. Language choice between writing in Latin and the romance offered the kings an effective and simple means to communicate more forcefully with their subjects, and, in doing so, better exert their relatively fragile authority...|$|R

40|$|The {{security}} {{dilemma is}} known {{to be one of the}} most important concepts in the field of International Relations and is often used to describe the causes of conflict in the international system. Insecurity concerning the motives of the other states creates incentives for each state to build up its own defense. As a consequence, this security dilemma can lead to a negative spiral of arms race and war, which none of the states actually prefer or benefit from. One of the other important concepts of International Relations is the deterrence model. The model is often described as an alternative explanation of the security dilemma-model, in which the causes of conflict and arms race is said to be actions put forward to deter an aggressive state. In the last couple of years, Russia has proved to the world that it is as a strong military capable state, which NATO and the U. S. are bound to take into account. After the military actions in Georgia in 2008, Russia made once again use of its military capacity against Ukraine. In March 2014, in a relative bloodless invasion, Russia took control over Crimea and, after a referendum, the area was included in the Russian Federation. The European states, NATO and the U. S. were shocked by the Russian military actions and by the short amount of time Russia used to mobilize and take control over the situation. The following period was characterized by a civil war in southeastern Ukraine, military buildup on both sides of the conflict, sanctions against Russia and an extensive diplomatic effort in the west to organize a response against what they consider to be Russian aggression. My research question is: are NATO/the West and Russia caught in a security dilemma? Can the security dilemma explain the relationship between Russia and NATO in 2014 and 2015, or is deterrence theory and balance of power better suited to explain why Russia and the West acts as they do? Through an empirical study of the actions initiated by Russia, NATO and the West in 2014 and 2015, I seek to uncover which of these two models that best describes the relationship. My findings show that there are elements of both sets of mechanisms in the period: Russia seems to be more motivated by an urge to change status quo than by fear, while NATO and the West seems to be primarily motivated by what they perceive as Russian aggression, which they ultimately want to deter. The data clearly shows that: 1) the states’ actions follow as a reaction to each other, indicating a tit-for-tat pattern. 2) NATO primarily uses economic or II <b>diplomatic</b> <b>instruments,</b> while Russia rely more heavily on military instruments. 3) NATO changed its strategy to a more military approach in 2015. 4) There is a difference in the weight given to and the effectiveness of NATO deterrence strategies between NATO member states and non-member states.
