25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> {{in the morning and}} goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up,</b> {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} {{entertainment}} industry magazine Variety praised The Projected Man, writing that the screenplay [...] "is a mosaic compiled from other films but the pieces hang together fairly well." [...] However, Variety criticised the character's motives, saying that [...] "the origin and motives {{of the third}} party are never fully explained." [...] The magazine wrote that the performances in the film were [...] "generally good," [...] and that [...] "the characters do not fall prey to the usual cliches." [...] Writing for Ottawa Citizen, Gordon Stoneham, reviewing the double bill of The Projected Man and Island of Terror, called The Projected Man [...] "dreadful stuff," [...] saying that the film was [...] "badly written, woodenly acted, and abounding in the cliches of the horror film genre." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "it is short and to the point" [...] and wrote that [...] "although it trods a familiar path, {{every now and then}} <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> with some arresting bit of cinematic coloring that rivels the attention." [...] Comparing the two films, he stated that The Projected Man was [...] "the best." [...] A TV Guide review wrote that the [...] "characters are better portrayed than usual in films of this nature, keeping the actors from becoming mere stereotypes" [...] and that [...] "subtle artistic direction and first-quality special effects give this picture a strong visual presence." [...] The review graded The Projected Man with two stars out of four. The anonymous reviewer for the British Kinematograph Weekly called the cast [...] "competent" [...] and noted that, while the [...] "plot [...] at least as old as H. G. Wells", {{there was something about the}} film that would challenge the [...] "hard-boiled child of today".|$|E

2500|$|Determining the player's best {{strategy}} {{within a given}} set of other rules the host must follow {{is the type of}} problem studied in game theory.

2500|$|Gamezebo's Erin Bell {{praised the}} game's {{animated}} sequences and highly detailed environments, {{which made the}} game easy on the eye, its character voice-overs, and pleasant soundtrack rounded out the high production values that {{she had come to}} expect from a Dream Chronicles game. But mostly in her review, Bell cited that The Book of Air lacked some of the outstanding factor of previous games in the series as she said that most of the mini-games were variations on things she had seen dozens of times before. Bell also felt that the story ultimately fell a bit flat as players were simply searching for a bunch of keys. Concluding the review, she said: [...] "The Book of Air is still an enjoyable casual adventure/HOG, but compared to the high standards set by previous games in the series, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> a little short. Let's hope that Lyra's next adventure is a more memorable one" [...] and eventually gave it 3.5 stars out of 5.|$|E

In the book, she calls heads; <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> tails, and he shoots and kills her. In the film adaptation, she refuses to call the toss, saying [...] "The coin don't have no say. [...] It's just you." [...] The movie then cuts to a shot of Chigurh leaving the house, checking the soles of his boots, implying that he has killed her. [...] While driving away from her house some three blocks away, Chigurh is badly injured in a car accident, sustaining a compound fracture of his left ulna and walking away with a limp. At the collision scene, before the authorities arrive, he offers $100 to a teenager on a bicycle to give him his shirt, seeking to use it to bind up his wounds himself. Chigurh then flees the scene before the ambulance arrives.|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to judge {{the degree to which}} ordinary people change to using metric in their daily lives. [...] In countries that have recently changed, older segments of the population tend to still use the older units. [...] Also, local variations abound in which units are round metric quantities or not. [...] In Canada, for example, ovens and cooking temperatures are usually measured in degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius. [...] Except for in cases of import items, all recipes and packaging include both Celsius and Fahrenheit, so Canadians are typically comfortable with both systems of measurement. [...] This extends to manufacturing, where companies are able to use both imperial and metric units, since the major export market is the U.S., but metric is required for both domestic use and for nearly all other export. [...] This {{may be due to the}} overwhelming influence of the neighbouring United States; similarly, many English Canadians (unlike most French Canadians) still often use non-metric measurements in day-to-day discussions of height and weight, and for clothing sizes, which are invariably measured in inches, though most driver's licences and other official government documents record weight and height only in metric (Saskatchewan driver licences, prior to the introduction of the current one-piece licence, indicated height in feet and inches but have switched to centimetres following the new licence format). [...] In Canadian schools, however, metric is the standard, except when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> in recipes, where both are included, or in practical lessons involving measuring wood or other materials for manufacturing. [...] In the United Kingdom, degrees Fahrenheit are seldom encountered (except when some people talk about hot summer weather), while other metric units are often used in conjunction with older measurements, and road signs use miles rather than kilometres. [...] Another example is [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] metric. [...] Canada converted liquid dairy products to litre, 500mL, and 250mL sizes, which caused some complaining at the time of the conversion, as a litre of milk is slightly over 35 imperial fluid ounces, while the former imperial quart used in Canada was 40ounces. [...] This is an example of a [...] "hard" [...] metric conversion. [...] Conversely, butter in Canada is sold primarily in a 454g package, which converts to one Imperial pound. This is considered a [...] "soft" [...] metric conversion. [...] Such countries could be said to be [...] "semi-metric". [...] However, unlike in the rest of Canada, metrication in the Francophone province of Quebec has been more implemented and metric measures are more consistently used in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada.|$|E
