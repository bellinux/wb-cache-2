60|$|Professor P. Smyth goes, I think, {{a little}} too far in making this contemptible feature compose such a quarrel as that between the English eruptionist and the Continental upheavalist. Deciding a disputed point, that {{elevation}} is a force and a method in nature, he explains the cave by the explosion of gases, which blew off the surface of the dome, 'when the <b>heavy</b> <b>sections</b> of the lava-roof, unsupported from below, fell downward again, wedging into and against each other, so as nearly to reform their previous figure.' But the unshattered state of the stones and the rounded surfaces of the sides show no sign of explosion. The upper Piton is unfitted for retaining water, which must percolate through its cinders, pumices, and loose matter into many a reservoir formed by blowing-holes. Snow must also be drifted in and retain, the cold. Moisture would be kept in the cavern by the low conducting power of its walls; so Lyell found, on Etna, a bed of solid ice under a lava-current. Possibly also this cave has a frozen substratum, like many of the ice-pools in North America.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Uniformity of {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} properties {{is required for}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> steel. In the present work, a <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> wind tower flange was manufactured by controlled ring-rolling. Post-rolling heat treatment was employed to optimize the microstructure and mechanical properties. The chemical composition, microstructure and mechanical properties in different zones of the flange were investigated. The results showed that the chemical composition and microstructure were uniformly distributed in the flange. The tensile strength showed similar values in different sampling locations. The strain and impact energies of specimens prepared along the longitudinal direction were higher than that prepared along both the radius and thickness directions. Notch direction did not have noticeable effect on the impact energy. It is demonstrated that the designed process is effective for producing <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> steel with improved quality...|$|R

50|$|The first {{rail rolling}} mill was {{established}} by John Birkenshaw in 1820, where he produced fish bellied wrought iron rails in lengths of 15 to 18 feet. With the advancement of technology in rolling mills the size of rolling mills grew rapidly along with the size products being rolled. Example of this was at The Great Exhibition in 1851 a plate 20 feet long, 3 ½ feet wide, and 7/16 of inch thick, weighed 1,125 pounds was exhibited by the Consett Iron Company. Further evolution of the rolling mill came {{with the introduction of}} Three-high mills in 1853 used for rolling <b>heavy</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{composition}} and heat treatment of <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> forging steel for {{reactor pressure vessel}} were optimized applying physical and numerical simulation methods, including numerical simulation to calculate temperature distribution during quench of model forging, artificial neural network to predict CCT diagrams of steels and small sample control cooling to simulate specific heat treatment. And the influence of compositon and heat treatment on microstructure and properties were discussed. Results showed that the experimental steel obtained satisfactory properties based on optimization of chemical {{composition and}} heat treatment. It is estimated that the hardenability and temper stability of experimental steel were improved by tungsten alloyment and higher temperature temper was good for superior microstructure, proper strength and better toughness. In the present work, application of simulation methods is proved to be reasonable for study on <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> forging steel...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the current work is to investigate the influence of different inoculation conditions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> ductile iron (DI) castings. Inoculation treatment was done via one step and double step treatments with different amounts of inoculants. The mechanical properties of the fabricated samples were evaluated. The best inoculation procedure in terms of graphite nodules characteristics and mechanical properties was double inoculation with 0. 8 % inoculants added at first and 0. 2 % in the late inoculation step. The presence of Sb {{in one of the}} cast alloys controlled the growth of graphite nodules in these <b>heavy</b> <b>section</b> ductile iron castings; however low impact toughness was recorded. The matrix structure of ductile cast iron showed a significant influence not only on the strength and impact properties but also on the fracture mode during testing...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} form the spherical-shaped nodules of graphite (called temper graphite nodules or temper carbon nodules) in the annealing process, {{care must be}} taken to ensure that the iron casting will solidify with an entirely white iron cross section. Thicker sections of a casting will cool slowly, allowing some primary graphite to form. This graphite forms random flake-like structures and will not transform to carbide during heat treatment. When stress is applied to such a casting in application, the fracture strength will be lower than expected for white iron. Such iron is said to have a 'mottled' appearance. Some countermeasures can be applied to enhance the formation of the all white structure, but malleable iron foundries often avoid producing <b>heavy</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sledgehammers {{are often}} used in {{destruction}} work, for breaking through drywall or masonry walls. Sledgehammers are seldom used in modern mining operations, particularly hand steel. Sledgehammers are also used when substantial force is necessary to dislodge a trapped object (often in farm or oil field work), or for fracturing concrete. Another common use is for driving fence posts into the ground. Sledgehammers are used by police forces in raids on property to gain entry by force, commonly through doors. They were and still are commonly used by blacksmiths to shape <b>heavy</b> <b>sections</b> of iron.

50|$|The {{steel is}} first {{annealed}} at approximately 820 C for 15-30 minutes for thin sections and for 1 hour per 25 mm thickness for <b>heavy</b> <b>sections,</b> to ensure {{formation of a}} fully austenitized structure. This is followed by air cooling to room temperature to form a soft, heavily-dislocated iron-nickel lath (untwinned) martensite. Subsequent aging (precipitation hardening) of the more common alloys for approximately 3 hours at a temperature of 480 to 500 °C produces a fine dispersion of Ni3(X,Y) intermetallic phases along dislocations left by martensitic transformation, where X and Y are solute elements added for such precipitation. Overaging leads {{to a reduction in}} stability of the primary, metastable, coherent precipitates, leading to their dissolution and replacement with semi-coherent Laves phases such as Fe2Ni/Fe2Mo. Further excessive heat-treatment brings about the decomposition of the martensite and reversion to austenite.|$|E

50|$|After merger the {{adjacent}} Appleby and Frodingham works both produced pig iron, with the Frodingham works specialising in bars and sections, and the Appleby works plates and slabs. In 1937 each site had four blast furnaces each, each with two relatively modern builds, {{with a maximum}} diameter of 17 ft in three; capacities of the four modern furnaces were two at 2,300 tons, one at 2,000 tons and one at 1,650 tons per week. Blast furnace gas was used at both sites to power electrical generators, and further energy recovery from the residual hot gas obtained from water tube boilers heated by the gas, or for heating in the steel works. Both works contained similar melting shops - the Appleby works had five tilting furnaces (open hearth) of 250 or 300 ton capacity. Employment over both sites was 6,500 in 1937. In {{the context of the}} wider United Steel group, rationalisation during the 1930s led the Appleby Frodingham works to be specialised in plates and <b>heavy</b> <b>sections,</b> whilst lighter section, bars, rod and wire were produced at the group's Steel, Peech and Tozer and Samuel Fox works in Yorkshire, with rails and ferroalloys at the Workington site., In 1945 the works was the largest in Britain, with a capacity of 700 million tons pa (5.5% national production), and occupied a 1700 acre site.|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of heavy section ductile iron castings is {{strongly influenced by}} the risk of graphite degeneration under slow cooling rates.
