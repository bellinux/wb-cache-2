They believed art teachers needed a periodical to help them develop and use emerging art curricula. Contributing writers have included Arthur Wesley Dow, Viktor Lowenfeld and John Dewey. SchoolArts articles have been used for movements such as Picture Study, the Arts and Crafts movement, and multiculturalism. SchoolArts grew and started publishing books. In 1958, Davis Publications was incorporated as a separate company that continued to publish SchoolArts.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of three pedagogical researches with students of the Architecture and Urbanization, Electrical Engineering and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Drawing</b> courses at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná. The Architecture and Urbanization students had a bimodal teaching. In the classroom teaching, theoretical and practical classes, tutorial and scenarios of collaborative learning activities based on projects were offered. In the virtual teaching, a site at the Internet was built to introduce the learning program, the didactic contract and the didactic material, and to help the apprentices on the new knowledge construction. To help the collaborative learning growth in a pedagogical approach of network learning community, the students' group used the Eureka interface. For the Electrical Engineering students three activities were proposed. The first one was an environmental heating project activity, accomplished in the classroom. The second was a bibliographical research using the forum tool of the Eureka system. The third activity consisted of implementing a proto-board plate electrical circuit to make the printed circuit plate. For the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Drawing</b> course students the developed activities with projects were established from the collaborative learning, seeking a form of using the teaching with research, which placed the students in front of a team situation that simulated the professional experience of Internet pages creation. The results of the researches indicated that with the collaborative learning new forms of teaching and learning could be developed and placed the students in the intersection of an enormous range of interactions...|$|E

40|$|The College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota {{is today}} {{one of the}} finest {{technological}} institutions in the country. It all began in 1851, when the Territorial Legislature founded the Minneapolis-based university as a preparatory school where, for the munificent sum of 4 a quarter, an elderly clergyman instructed a handful of local children in the three Rs. The technical subjects developed in fits and starts, spurred by the passage of the Morrill Act in 1862, which offered states (Minnesota had taken its first baby steps as a state in 1858) large grants of land in exchange for college-level work in agriculture and vocational training in engineering, <b>industrial</b> <b>drawing,</b> and other “mechanic arts” subjects. With the financial backing of state senator and flour magnate John Sargent Pillsbury, who joined the university’s board of trustees in 1863, school officials effectively shelved plans by the state’s agricultural interests to create a second campus elsewhere.

40|$|This study imparts a {{scientific}} {{perception of a}} phosphorous-producing submerged arc furnace never seen before; a proverbial fingerprint that can improve problem identification, disturbance diagnostics, process prediction, dynamic modelling and model predictive control {{of this type of}} furnace. It successfully incorporates accurate, multi-field thermodynamic-, kinetic- and industrial data with computational flow dynamic calculations; thus further unifying the sciences of kinetics and equilibrium thermodynamics. The true power of this study is the extensive and methodical validation that ensures industrially endorsed results. To facilitate all this the author spent six uninterrupted months at an industrial plant (Thermphos International), twice walked inside a cold submerged-arc furnace, gathered and analysed more than thirty-four mineralogical samples, managed an extensive and insightful sampling campaign on the slag streams, performed feed material porosity tests and had thirteen additional temperature probes installed inside the furnace lining. The author also scrutinised over years of industrial data, inspected many <b>industrial</b> <b>drawing</b> and partook in countless valuable conversations with industrial and technical experts to guarantee, not only a valuable scientific contribution, but one that is deep-rooted in authentic engineering principles.

40|$|Abstract Emerging from my {{interest}} in past methods of drawing instruction, and personal experiences of being taught drawing in the 1960 ’s by an industrial arts teacher, {{led me to the}} study of teaching methods of Walter Smith (1836 - 1886) in the 1870 ’s. This historical study of drawing methods used in the public schools in Massachusetts when Smith was hired by the state, to implement drawing into the public schools, revealed instructional methods based on simple elements and principles of design. Smith used six methods of drawing instruction: drawing from printed copies, drawing from the blackboard, drawing from dictation, drawing from memory, drawing from objects and drawing decorative designs. His use of personal slates and small cards with step by step directions for each day of the week all followed a sequential order for students and teachers to follow. Beginning with lines, geometric shapes, and proportions, students would understand, know, and be able to accomplish assignments successfully. Students were taught how to draw and were able to retain what they had learned through clear understanding and continual practice. This study argued that Smith’s methods would benefit public middle school classrooms today. By combining methods of the past with current practices and current technological advantages this study will offer teachers an alternative way to approach drawing instruction for the diverse middle school classrooms in the present time.

The purpose of this biographical {{study was to examine the}} development of the educational philosophy and practices of Josephine C. Locke, supervisor of drawing for the Chicago public schools, 1891 [...] 1900. The narrative focused on how an influential late nineteenth-century educator attempted to reform elementary education. Within the last decade of the nineteenth-century, Locke transformed drawing instruction in the Chicago public elementary schools by introducing ambitious ideas about self-expression to thousands of students. Locke was a spur in the side of traditional educators. Unlike teachers of the past, Locke placed the child's imagination at the center of art instruction while she discouraged teaching through imitation. Initially, Locke founded her early philosophy on Froebel's theories. Eventually, she moved away from instruction in <b>industrial</b> <b>drawing</b> for elementary children toward art education that allowed children to express their thoughts and feelings. Evolving attitudes and methods of art education are analyzed through the exploration of primary resources [...] -annual reports from the St. Louis and Chicago public school systems, National Educational Association proceedings and addresses, and articles published in the Central Art Association's journal Arts for America. Also discussed is the culmination of Locke's work as represented by the school children's drawing exhibitions held at the Art Institute of Chicago and her later endeavors to reform education through movements like women's suffrage. The study concludes with commentary as to why some educational issues persist today [...] -such as the prominence given to product and results rather than process and growth; deficiencies in teacher preparation in art; overcrowded classrooms which limit opportunities for individualized and hands-on instruction; dependence upon textbooks rather than child-relevant experiences; and insufficient importance given to the affective domain [...] -even though Locke was once at the cutting edge of educational change...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of digital representation, which began in the 60 s and {{continued}} to evolve, has developed many tools that today the designer can use to give a shape to hist houghts. The panorama is so vast that it may appear confusing: the creation of a specific form in the virtual digital space can be achieved by moving along different paths. However, even though, apparently, several methods can produce the same formal result, only a few of them are qualitatively significant from the point of viewof the model’s computational versatility and topological quality; these are characteristics that are necessary and indispensable to conduct subsequent trials and elaborations on the model. deFormare was written with the purpose of highlighting the main and most significantdigital modeling techniques, organising the theoretical principles with simplicity,and providing information and examples on their possible applications. The book’stitle expresses a set of concepts that inspired its writing. The echo of the“de” from the Latin language followed by the digital “dot” and then the verb “formare” (to form) stress the desire to talk about “giving shape” to digital objects with the same spirit of application that characterized the ancient treatises on architecture and painting. At the same time, the word in its entirety, which reads as “deforming”, wants to highlight how, in digital sense, the “forming” process is frequently characterised by processing operations of a pre-existing model. Indirectly, the book is also an image of the teaching experience attained in the courses“Digital Modeling” and “Science of Representation,” which are associated to the degrees in <b>Industrial</b> <b>Drawing</b> and in Architecture and Construction Technology, respectively,at the Department of Architecture “Ludovico Quaroni” of the University of Rome“La Sapienza”. This experience has shaped the logical succession of the presentation of the digital techniques: noting where the theoretical path of the syllabus,which was based on traditional logic, moved away from the autonomous pathssought by the students, who were motivated by a different dynamics of learning; mediating the results of the analysis, and finally establishing a common paththat appears to converge towards operational practices that are similar to buildingin the real world. Therefore,the digital modeling techniques are presented - at least in the initial phase - accordingto a logical path of learning that proceeds from the bottom to the top, and that takes its cue from the needs that each of us would have in the real world if we were tobuild a physical model with traditional tools and techniques. The applications should be interpreted as “easy pieces” of modeling that are useful to understand a certain technique so that that technique can then be systematically applied to objects that are more complex. Wherever possible, the applications refer to forms that can be found indesign objects that can are apt to be described concisely; however, the writer believes that the same applications are equally useful for modeling in Architecture...|$|E
