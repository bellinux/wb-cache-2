5|$|In 922 the Bulgarians renewed their {{offensive}} in Thrace {{to divert the}} Byzantines from the clandestine negotiations with the Fatimid Caliphate to form a Bulgarian–Arab alliance for a joint assault of Constantinople. Simeon <b>I</b> <b>remained</b> at the siege of Adrianople while another army {{was sent to the}} Byzantine capital. In June 922 the Bulgarians engaged and defeated yet another Byzantine army. A few weeks later Adrianople surrendered. In the meantime, the Byzantines captured the ship with the Bulgarian and Fatimid envoys on its way back to Bulgaria. Romanos I thus learned about the negotiations and outbid the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>remained</b> on {{the wreck}} until she went down; the suction took me down some way, {{and a man}} got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; {{hundreds}} of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
25|$|Around 1090, Conrad's grandson, Emperor Henry IV, {{conducted}} an ambitious reconstruction {{in order to}} enlarge the cathedral. He had the eastern sections demolished and the foundations enforced {{to a depth of}} up to eight metres. Only the lower floors and the crypt of Speyer <b>I</b> <b>remained</b> intact. The nave was elevated by five metres and the flat wooden ceiling replaced with a groin vault of square bays, one of the outstanding achievements of Romanesque architecture. Each vault extends over two bays of the elevation. Every second pier was enlarged by adding a broad pilaster or dosseret, which formed a system of interior buttressing. Engaged shafts had appeared around 1030 in buildings along the Loire (St. Benoit-sur-Loire, Auxerre, Loches) from where the technique spread to Normandy and the Rhineland.|$|E

25|$|On July 22, 1969 Arrúe {{recorded}} {{the second of}} the two most emotional moments in his political career: in an open, one-by-one Cortes voting in front of Franco he voiced against Juan Carlos de Borbón as the future king of Spain. Paradoxically, at that time he was increasingly alienated by the pro-democratic turn of the dynasty he remained loyal to. Though when in 1970 Carlos Hugo established his Gabinete Ideologico, Arrúe joined its foral commission, he remained in this body no longer than until 1971. Following a scandal related to re-election negotiations of the Navarrese MPs, he broke up with Partido Carlista, now firmly controlled by the socialist progressists, and did not run in the 1971 elections. He kept considering himself a Traditionalist and an immense portrait of the Carlist king Javier <b>I</b> <b>remained</b> in his office.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, <b>I</b> <b>remained</b> for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E
500|$|Dieskau {{had already}} made several {{contributions}} {{to the development of}} the artillery. Although the King despised artillery men in general, Frederick recognized the value of the units and had brought in Field Marshall Samuel von Schmettau as the artillery [...] "grand master." [...] By 1741, Frederick had formed a second battalion that included a bombardier and five cannon companies. [...] The bombardiers manned the howitzers and mortars, the most specialized tasks; the cannon companies were distributed throughout the army. [...] In 1742, he created an additional artillery garrison at Breslau. [...] In 1744, two battalions received the title of Field Regiment Artillery, under command of Schmettau, although the aging General Christian Nicolaus von Linger, the artillery master of Frederick Wilhelm <b>I,</b> <b>remained</b> in nominal command.|$|E

500|$|McClintock {{began her}} studies at Cornell's College of Agriculture in 1919. There, she participated in student {{government}} and {{was invited to}} join a sorority, though she soon realized that she preferred not to join formal organizations. Instead, McClintock took up music, specifically jazz. She studied botany, receiving a BSc in 1923. Her interest in genetics began when she took her first course in that field in 1921. The course {{was based on a}} similar one offered at Harvard University, and was taught by C. B. Hutchison, a plant breeder and geneticist. Hutchison was impressed by McClintock's interest, and telephoned to invite her to participate in the graduate genetics course at Cornell in 1922. McClintock pointed to Hutchison's invitation as the reason she continued in genetics: [...] "Obviously, this telephone call cast the die for my future. <b>I</b> <b>remained</b> with genetics thereafter." [...] Although {{it has been reported that}} women could not major in genetics at Cornell, and therefore her MA and PhD—earned in 1925 and 1927, respectively—were officially awarded in botany, recent research has revealed that women did earn graduate degrees in Cornell's Plant Breeding Department during the time that McClintock was a student at Cornell.|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, [...] and [...] España (originally named Alfonso XIII), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of El Ferrol, fell into Nationalist hands in July 1936. The crew aboard Jaime <b>I</b> <b>remained</b> loyal to the Republic, killed their officers, who apparently supported Franco's attempted coup, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units. In April 1937, España ran into a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, Jaime I was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On May 29, 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship [...] outside Ibiza, causing severe damage and loss of life. [...] retaliated two days later by bombarding Almería, causing much destruction, and the resulting Deutschland incident meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.|$|E

Andrey Pervozvanny was called out for active operations twice, in April and November 1916.
