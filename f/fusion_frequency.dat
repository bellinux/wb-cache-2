5000|$|Different {{points in}} the visual system have very {{different}} critical flicker fusion rate (CFF) sensitivities; the overall threshold frequency for perception cannot exceed the slowest of these for a given modulation amplitude. Each cell type integrates signals differently. For example, rod photoreceptor cells, which are exquisitely sensitive and capable of single-photon detection, are very sluggish, with time constants in mammals of about 200 ms. Cones, in contrast, while having much lower intensity sensitivity, have much better time resolution than rods do. For both rod- and cone-mediated vision, the <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> increases {{as a function of}} illumination intensity, until it reaches a plateau corresponding to the maximal time resolution for each type of vision.

50|$|In contrast, though {{other species}} have low larynges, their tongues remain {{anchored}} {{in their mouths}} and their vocal tracts cannot produce the range of speech sounds of humans. The ability to lower the larynx transiently in some species extends {{the length of the}}ir vocal tract, which as Fitch showed creates the acoustic illusion that they are larger. Research at Haskins Laboratories in the 1960s showed that speech allows humans to achieve a vocal communication rate that exceeds the <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> of the auditory system by fusing sounds together into syllables and words. The additional speech sounds that the human tongue enables us to produce, particularly i, allow humans to unconsciously infer the length of the vocal tract of the person who is talking, a critical element in recovering the phonemes that make up a word.|$|E
5000|$|The flicker fusion {{threshold}} {{is proportional}} to the amount of modulation; if brightness is constant, a brief flicker will manifest a much lower threshold frequency than a long flicker. The threshold also varies with brightness (it is higher for a brighter light source) and with location on the retina where the perceived image falls: the rod cells of the human eye have a faster response time than the cone cells, so flicker can be sensed in peripheral vision at higher frequencies than in foveal vision. This is essentially the concept known as the Ferry-Porter law, where it may take some increase in brightness, by powers of ten, to require as many as 60 flashes to achieve fusion, while for rods, it may take as little as four flashes, since in the former case each flash is easily cut off, and in the latter it lasts long enough, even after 1/4 second, to merely prolong it and not intensify it. [...] From a practical point of view, if a stimulus is flickering, such as computer monitor, decreasing the intensity level will eliminate the flicker.The flicker fusion threshold also is lower for a fatigued observer. Decrease in the critical <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> has often been used as an index of central fatigue.|$|E

The electroretinogram of both species changes from the scotopic type in the dark-adapted state to the photopic type after strong light adaptation. For the scotopic response <b>fusion</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to 18 flashes per sec. are obtained in both species. For the photopic response <b>fusion</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to 50 flashes per sec. are seen in Tarentola, and up to 25 flashes per sec. in Hemidactylus. Proceeding from dark to light adaptation the increment threshold (dI) is measured at different levels of adaptive illumination (I). At low levels of illumination the dI/I ratio is found to be small and at high levels of illumination to be large. No difference in the dI/I ratio is obtained for test lights of 462 and 605 mµ. During dark adaptation the change of threshold after exposure to moderate and weak lights (up to 103 times dark threshold) is rather fast. After light adaptation to strong light (106 times dark threshold) duplex dark adaptation curves are seen with a break separating a fast and a slow phase of dark adaptation.

Their bright and sharp light pulses also hold {{the promise to}} be effective stimuli of visual evoked potentials. By mixing flickering red/green/blue (RGB) lights of different intensity like what the LCD panels with LED backlights have been doing, one can embed invisible VEP stimuli into color displays and use those stimuli for various brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of inducing steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEPs) using polychromatic LED lights flickering above the critical flicker fusion and color <b>fusion</b> <b>frequencies</b> of human vision. Jiang et al. showed that polychromatic lights flickering above human color/flicker <b>fusion</b> <b>frequencies</b> can activate distinct visual cortical areas observable using fMRI [1]. This study performed a parallel experiment to compare the SSVEP responses induced by the same combination of red and green lights. Leveraging on high temporal resolution of EEG signals, this study compared the SSVEP responses towards red/green stimuli with different duty cycles (20 %, 50 %) and relative phases (0 °, 90 °, 180 °). The same equipment and darkened shielded room for our other experiments [2] were used, but two LED stroboscopes were employed to produce red and green light pulses at identical frequencies but different intensity of 51 cd/m 2 and 102 cd/m 2 respectively. Nine healthy subjects (7 male and 2 female) participated in this experiment. Their 64 -channel EEG signals were analyzed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) techniques.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the mean critical <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> and the short-term fluctuation, {{to analyze the}} influence of age, gender, and the learning effect in healthy subjects undergoing flicker perimetry. METHODS: Study 1 - 95 healthy subjects underwent flicker perimetry once in one eye. Mean critical <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> values were compared between genders, {{and the influence of}} age was evaluated using linear regression analysis. Study 2 - 20 healthy subjects underwent flicker perimetry 5 times in one eye. The first 3 sessions were separated by an interval of 1 to 30 days, whereas the last 3 sessions were performed within the same day. The first 3 sessions were used to investigate the presence of a learning effect, whereas the last 3 tests were used to calculate short-term fluctuation. RESULTS: Study 1 - Linear regression analysis demonstrated that mean global, foveal, central, and critical <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> per quadrant significantly decreased with age (p 0. 05), {{with the exception of the}} central area and inferonasal quadrant (p= 0. 049 and p= 0. 011, respectively), where the values were lower in females.

The mean global short-term fluctuation was 5. 06 ± 1. 13 Hz, the mean interindividual and intraindividual variabilities were 11. 2 ± 2. 8 % and 6. 4 ± 1. 5 %, respectively.

However, it remains poorly understood how the central processing controls the <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency.</b> Here we show that the <b>fusion</b> <b>frequency</b> can be elevated by extra-retinal signals during smooth pursuit. This eye movement can keep the image of a moving target in the fovea, but it also introduces a backward retinal sweep of the stationary background pattern.

This temporal improvement cannot be ascribed to a general increase in contrast gain of specific neural mechanisms during pursuit, since the improvement was not observed with a pattern flickering without changing position on the retina or with a pattern moving in the direction opposite to the background motion during pursuit. Our findings indicate that chromatic fusion is controlled by a cortical mechanism that suppresses motion blur. A plausible mechanism is that eye-movement signals change spatiotemporal trajectories along which color signals are integrated so as to reduce chromatic integration at the same locations (i. e., along stationary trajectories) on the retina tha...|$|E
