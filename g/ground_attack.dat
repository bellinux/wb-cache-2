5|$|The Polikarpov design bureau (OKB) was ordered, in 1936, {{to begin}} {{development}} of a fast twin-engined aircraft {{that could be used}} for <b>ground</b> <b>attack</b> duties and as a heavy fighter. It delivered the <b>ground</b> <b>attack</b> version the following year for evaluation, although it could be modified as necessary for other roles. The VIT-1 was reasonably successful, but it was decided to give it more powerful engines and modify its structure. The improved aircraft was designated as the VIT-2.|$|E
5|$|Development V/STOL <b>ground</b> <b>attack</b> and {{reconnaissance}} fighter, six {{built as}} pre-production evaluation aircraft before the type was ordered into production as the Harrier GR.1. First aircraft flew from Dunsfold on 31 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber raids, VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with <b>ground</b> <b>attack</b> missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 <b>ground</b> <b>attack</b> raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E
