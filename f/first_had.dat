5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the <b>first</b> <b>had</b> been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk, {{the series}} {{that the writer}} had pitched {{to him at the}} beginning of the decade. Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat's three years as an English teacher. The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the <b>first</b> <b>had</b> aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that he might get attacked in the street.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting <b>first</b> <b>had</b> accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the <b>first</b> <b>had</b> {{almost as soon as}} its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the tests}} in Oslo, a {{delegation}} {{was sent to}} look at compatible systems outside Oslo. After it had returned, the company went into negotiations with three manufacturers: Duewag, Bautzen and Ansaldo/Firema. Oslo Sporveier {{signed a contract with}} Ansaldo/Firema for delivery of 17 units in 1997–98, with options for additional 15 units. The first 17 units cost , or NOK20million per vehicle. The option rights were later exercised, and the total order was increased to 32. This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated, and would give a maximum age in the tram fleet to 18 years. While Oslo Sporveier at <b>first</b> <b>had</b> planned to debt-finance the purchase, by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E

5|$|For {{the return}} match between NSW and the British Isles on 25 June, each side made four changes. In the opening period, the sides were evenly matched but {{eventually}} the British scored a try in the corner, which was converted, and a second try soon after took them eight points clear. The visitors were up 13–0 at half time after another converted try: the home side had made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line. The second half started as the <b>first</b> <b>had</b> ended, with NSW dominating, but they failed to score; instead, the British managed to counter-attack to score another converted try. NSW then managed to score a try but Verge failed to convert. The tourists then scored another three tries, one of them converted. With Britain leading 3–29 in the closing minutes, NSW scored a second try; this time Wickham missed the conversion. The final score was 6–29.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, {{but by the}} first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the <b>first</b> <b>had</b> been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy <b>first</b> <b>had</b> to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 Solti {{was invited}} to become music {{director}} of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The <b>first</b> <b>had</b> been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent <b>first</b> <b>had</b> to acknowledge his crime, and then {{would have to}} go to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} their first meeting since Alabama {{defeated}} the Tigers 38–28 during the 1978 season, and their first as conference foes, Alabama won 42–10 at Missouri on a stormy afternoon. The Crimson Tide opened the scoring on their second offensive play when Eddie Lacy had a 73-yard touchdown run for an early 7–0 Alabama lead. After each team traded punts, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted a Corbin Berkstresser pass that set up Alabama's second scoring drive from the 50-yard line. AJ McCarron <b>first</b> <b>had</b> a 44-yard completion to Kenny Bell, and then Lacy scored his second touchdown of the afternoon on a three-yard run two plays later for a 14–0 lead. The third Crimson Tide touchdown {{of the first quarter}} was set up after Landon Collins blocked a Trey Barrow punt that was recovered at the Missouri 17-yard line. Three T. J. Yeldon runs later, Alabama led 21–0.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he <b>first</b> <b>had</b> {{to wait for}} his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, {{and then he was}} forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|Rosas {{desired to}} {{recreate}} the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He aimed to build a powerful, republican state with Argentina placed at the center. The defunct Viceroyalty had shattered into several separate nations following the Argentine War of Independence {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. To achieve reunification, the Argentine government needed to annex the three neighboring countries - Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay, as well as to incorporate a portion of the southern region of Brazil. Rosas <b>first</b> <b>had</b> to gather allies across the region who shared his vision. In some instances, this meant that he had to become involved in the internal politics of neighboring countries, backing those sympathetic to union with Argentina, and occasionally even financing rebellions and wars.|$|E

5|$|Sanger {{returned}} to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She <b>first</b> <b>had</b> to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77. Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.Sanger, Autobiography, pp. 183–189.Engelman, p. 61–62: Sanger also gained sympathy from the public when her five-year-old daughter died immediately before the trial. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned their attention to other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding of Yorkshire Council {{is based}} in Beverley, in the former {{headquarters}} of Humberside County Council, and East Riding County Council before that. There are 26 wards electing a total of 67 councillors in the District. The council elects on a four-yearly cycle with all seats up for election at the same time.
