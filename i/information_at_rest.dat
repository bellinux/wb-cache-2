40|$|This Master's {{dissertation}} explored {{whether a}} rapid orienting of attention toward {{or away from}} social stress information during a restful state, relates to the magnitude of glucocorticoids (GC) released {{in response to a}} stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). It also assessed whether childhood rearing in a low socioeconomic status (SES) context mediates this relationship. Subjects rested for 45 minutes during which time they completed a modified version of Posner's attention paradigm, comprising social stress words. Immediately following, participants were exposed to the stressor. Results indicated that a rapid attentional engagement toward social stress words associated with pronounced GC responses to the TSST. Fast engagers displayed lower self-esteem and did not differ in terms of their past SES. These findings demonstrate that attentional biases for social stress <b>information</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> combine with diminished self-esteem to predict the magnitude of GC released during psychological stress irrespective of early SES conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Interventions for {{improvement}} of cognitive problems in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) include electroencephalography biofeedback, also known as neurofeedback. Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) patterns are assessed in TBI patients and then compared to a database obtained from a normative popu-lation. Deviations in QEEG patterns from the normative group are the basis for an intervention plan. While QEEG patterns, obtained under an eyes closed, resting condition, provide <b>information</b> about deviations <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> QEEG pat-terns obtained while the patient engages in cognitive tasks reflect specific deficiencies in brain functioning. This paper reviews and assesses QEEG patterns collected under both resting conditions as well as cognitive tasks.

This can provide noninvasive <b>information</b> <b>at</b> the earliest stage. In this work, the problem of categorising – in a quantifiable manner – information content of microvascular blood flow signals recorded in healthy participants and patients with varicose veins is addressed. For this purpose, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) signals – that reflect microvascular blood flow – recorded both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and after acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation (an endothelial-dependent vasodilator) are analyzed. Each signal is processed with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). An entropy measure of each IMFs is then computed. The results show that IMFs of LDF signals have different complexity for different physiologic/pathological states. This is true both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and after ACh stimulation. Thus, the proposed framework (EMD + entropy computation) {{may be used to}} gain a noninvasive understanding of LDF signals in patients with microvascular dysfunctions. </p...|$|R

The second research question is whether subjective outcome (VAS/WOMAC) after hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (TKA) differs in patients with or without nocturnal pain and pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> preoperatively compared to those who do not. METHODS: A consecutive group of 189 TKAs and 189 THAs was evaluated. The influence of pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and nocturnal pain preoperatively on the outcome was evaluated by means of a one-way ANOVA. Outcome measurements used were WOMAC, VAS pain and VAS Satisfaction. RESULTS: The results show that satisfaction at follow up was not influenced by the presence of nocturnal pain or pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> preoperatively. The presence of nocturnal pain and pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> preoperatively did result in a poorer WOMAC pain score WOMAC physical impairment score and a higher VAS pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and activity after surgery for both THA and TKA. CONCLUSION: The results show that the presence of pain at night and pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> in symptomatic osteoarthritic patients results in worse VAS and WOMAC scores, but with similar amounts of satisfaction at follow up.

Hydralazine, 50 to 100 mg orally every 6 hours, produced significant increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during exercise (p < 0. 01) and in left ventricular stroke work index <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> (p < 0. 01) and during exercise (p < 0. 05), significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during exercise (p < 0. 01) and significant increases in radionuclide angiographic left ventricular ejection fraction <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> (control 0. 21 ± 0. 06 vs. hydralazine 0. 26 ± 0. 07, p < 0. 01) and during exercise (control 0. 21 ± 0. 08 vs. hydralazine 0. 24 ± 0. 09, p < 0. 05). However, there were no statistically significant correlations between changes in radionuclide ejection fraction with hydralazine and changes in hemodynamic variables with hydralazine, either <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> or during exercise. Patients responding hemodynamically to hydralazine could {{not be separated from}} those not responding {{on the basis of the}} radionuclide ejection fraction <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> or changes in ejection fraction with hydralazine. It is concluded that: 1) hydralazine exerts beneficial effects on cardiac index, stroke volume index, left ventricular stroke work index and systemic vascular resistance both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during exercise; 2) hydralazine therapy is associated with improvement in the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during exercise; but 3) the radionuclide ejection fraction response to hydralazine does not correlate with and cannot be used to predict the hemodynamic response to hydralazine in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To clarify whether {{assessment}} of the acoustic properties of the myocardium <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> can predict contractile reserve in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction.  METHODS— 23 patients (mean (SD) age 63  (12) years) with chronic left ventricular dysfunction were studied. The magnitude of cardiac cycle dependent variation of integrated backscatter (CVIB) of the myocardium was measured <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> in the basal and mid segment of the septum and posterior wall of the left ventricle, using a real time two dimensional integrated backscatter imaging system. The results were compared with the percentage wall thickening and the wall motion <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during low dose dobutamine infusion. The wall motion was graded as normal, hypokinetic, or akinetic and contractile reserve was considered present when an akinetic or hypokinetic segment improved during dobutamine infusion.  RESULTS—The CVIB <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> correlated with per cent wall thickening <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during dobutamine infusion (<b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> r =  0. 61, p <  0. 0001, during dobutamine, r =  0. 76, p <  0. 0001). Of the 76  segments examined, 27  showed contractile reserve. The mean CVIB <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> was significantly greater in segments with contractile reserve than in those without (p <  0. 0001). CVIB above 3  dB <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> predicted segments with contractile reserve with a sensitivity and specificity of 81 % and 60 %, respectively (p <  0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—CVIB reflected not only myocardial contractility but also the functional capacity of the myocardium. It predicted segmental contractile reserve in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction.    Keywords: contractile reserve; acoustic properties of myocardium; cyclic variation of integrated backscatter; left ventricular dysfunctio...|$|R

During exercise, myocardial O 2 consumption increased from 167 +/- 18 micromol/min <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> to 399 +/- 27 micromol/min at 5 km/h (P </= 0. 05), which was paralleled by an increase in O 2 delivery, so that myocardial O 2 extraction (76 +/- 1 and 78 +/- 1 % <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and 5 km/h, respectively) and coronary venous PO 2 (24. 5 +/- 1. 0 and 22. 8 +/- 0. 3 mmHg <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and 5 km/h, respectively) remained unchanged. After adenosine receptor blockade with 8 -phenyltheophylline (5 mg/kg iv), the relation between myocardial O 2 consumption and coronary vascular resistance was shifted toward higher resistance, whereas myocardial O 2 extraction rose to 81 +/- 1 and 83 +/- 1 % <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and 5 km/h and coronary venous PO 2 fell to 19. 2 +/- 0. 8 and 18. 9 +/- 0. 8 mmHg <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and 5 km/h, respectively (all P </= 0. 05).

METHODS: Primiparous women were examined 3 months postpartum by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) assessment and for LAM avulsion clinically by digital palpation and by transperineal TUI performed <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and on pelvic floor muscle contraction. LAM avulsion was diagnosed on TUI when the three central slices were abnormal. A comparison was made between LAM avulsion diagnosed <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and on maximum contraction. Two independent blinded investigators performed the analyses and a third investigator resolved discrepancies. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety primiparae were analyzed providing 380 results for comparison, as right and left LAM were analyzed independently. LAM avulsion was found in 36 (9. 5 %) images obtained <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and in 35 (9. 2 %) on contraction, revealing moderate correlation between the two (ICC, 0. 58 (95 % CI, 0. 51 - 0. 64)). Twenty-two cases of LAM avulsion were identified both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and on contraction. One woman had LAM avulsion on palpation, which was seen on TUI as LAM avulsion on contraction, but not <b>at</b> <b>rest.</b> More cases of anterior and posterior compartment prolapse were found in women with LAM avulsion diagnosed on contraction only compared to LAM avulsion observed <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> only (POP-Q assessment point Ba, - 1. 8 vs - 2. 5 (P = 0. 075) and point Bp, - 2. 5 vs - 2. 8 (P = 0. 072)). CONCLUSIONS: Findings on transperineal TUI performed in women <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and on contraction correlate reasonably well.
