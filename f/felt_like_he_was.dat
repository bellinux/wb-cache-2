But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, André Gomes and Paco Alcácer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought in. Pako Ayestarán was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four-straight defeats at the {{beginning}} of the 2016–17 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director Jesús García Pitarch also resigned, saying he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 13th place. On 27 March, Mateu Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.|$|E

In 2009, Lens was called up for Suriname's squad by national team coach Wensley Bundel, for the Parbo Bier Cup. He scored two goals in three matches and helped Suriname finish second in the tournament. Since the tournament was not under the auspices of FIFA, Lens was still eligible for a call-up for the Netherlands.|$|R

25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E

500|$|Jim Morrison, a self-professed [...] "acid-evangelist of rock", {{had been}} {{fascinated with the}} public media outlets and {{frequently}} coined buzzwords and phrases to generate attention for the Doors. The band's rise to stardom and publications drawing Morrison as a sex symbol, however, drastically modified his outlook on pop culture. Throughout 1968, Morrison's behavior became increasingly erratic: he began drinking heavily and distanced himself from studio work to focus on his more immediate passions, poetry and film making. At the time, Morrison was also struggling with anxiety, and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{on the brink of}} a nervous breakdown.

50|$|Jackson {{became a}} {{champion}} racing cyclist of Austria {{at an early}} age. Later he became a trick bicycle rider and traveled over much of Europe. While appearing at the Crystal Palace in London, the handlebars of his bicycle came off. He waved the handlebars wildly {{as a gesture of}} despair. The laughs from the audience brought down the house and it gave Jackson the idea for his famous act. From then on <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a comedian. In all his years on the stage, Jackson did his act in pantomime. Preferring intimate settings, Jackson worked almost exclusively in vaudeville and European one-ring circuses. His act took him to England, Europe, Russia, Siberia, Turkey, and the United States. During the New York World's Fair, he appeared in the American Jubilee. Shortly afterward, he opened a restaurant and dance hall in Greenwood Lake, New York, where he made his home. In his late years he devoted most of his time to managing his eatery, making only infrequent stage appearances, mostly in New York, when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> also a capable magician.|$|R

500|$|Writer Gareth Roberts {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he was considering bringing the character of Craig back when he saw James Corden's performance in [...] "The Lodger", saying that [...] "it already <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> one of the Who family". Showrunner Steven Moffat was pleased with [...] "The Lodger", an episode he called [...] "quite close to my heart", and wanted to bring Craig back. He commented that it was a change of pace for Corden, who usually was cast as [...] "the funny one"; as Craig he is [...] "the straight man to the wacky Doctor". Director Steve Hughs compared the Doctor and Craig to famous comedic duos such as Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Though most of the episode is intended to be fun, it also sets the stage for the finale and the Doctor's upcoming death. The [...] "serious" [...] final scene, written by Moffat, concluded events in River's life that had been hinted since [...] "Flesh and Stone". Other episode titles suggested by Roberts included [...] "Everything Must Go", [...] "The Last Adventure", and [...] "Cyberman and a Baby".

500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss <b>was</b> <b>he!</b> His sins lay elsewhere. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> the father. [...] The power. The glory. And <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, no question about it." [...] she said. [...] "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until I really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, music student Michael [...] "Miguel" [...] Happoldt {{offered to}} let the band record in the studio at the school where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> studying, {{although}} without the school's knowledge. The band agreed, and sneaked into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning. That recording session resulted in the popular cassette tape, Jah Won't Pay the Bills, released in 1991. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California. It was during this time that Nowell became involved with drugs. For years, Nowell refused to try heroin; however, as he entered his twenties and witnessed his band's success, he decided to try the drug. Nowell's father explained, [...] "His excuse for taking the heroin <b>was</b> that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had to <b>be</b> larger than life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> leading the band, leading his fans, {{and he had to}} put on this persona.

500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
500|$|Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} C+, {{describing}} the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent Warcraft movie adaptation: {{he said that the}} visuals [...] "offer a deep dive into the Uncanny Valley", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak. Meghan Sullivan, writing for IGN, gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie [...] "gorgeous", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework [...] "solid", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up Kingsglaive as [...] "a very beautiful and very confusing movie". Andrew Barker for Variety frequently questioned whether Kingsglaive could count as a movie, as he often <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> watching a recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and too full of throwaway characters. Wired's Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of Final Fantasy XV. His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it [...] "a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice".|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1992 season, Zolak also looked {{unlikely}} to appear, being behind Hodson and Millen on the depth chart. Millen started the first five games before being injured, and then Hodson became the starter. In early November, Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints. Relieving Hodson, he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost, 3114. The next week, Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the Patriots' first win of the season, 3734. As a result of his performance, he was named the American Football Conference (AFC) Player of the Week. The next week, Zolak led his team to their second victory of the season against the New York Jets. He completed seven of 16 passes for 102yards, getting help from Jon Vaughn who had 110 rushing yards, and the Patriots won, 243. However, the following week's performance against the Atlanta Falcons was less impressive. He completed nine of 16 passes for 58yards and two interceptions in the Patriots' losing effort, and he said it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "on a desert island by myself." [...] After Zolak's performance against Atlanta, he lost the starting job, and Millen again filled that role. However, Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts, and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis, he again became the starter for the game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Zolak injured his ankle {{at the end of the}} third quarter, making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as Jeff Carlson took over quarterbacking duties. Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts, 561yards, two touchdowns, four interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 58.8.|$|E

40|$|Unlike prior {{research}} that has confined customer rage to a single point in time, this article explores the unfolding of rage over three time periods, at the initial service failure (Episode 1) and two ineffective service recovery attempts (Episodes 2 and 3). In each episode, we examine the association between loss, or a threat of loss, of personal resources (e. g., self-esteem, sense of jus-tice, sense of control, and economic resources such as time and money) and negative emotions. We empirically demonstrate {{for the first time}} that although rage may sometimes take place at the initial service failure (Episode 1), rage does not tend to be an immediate reaction. Rather, it is when service failures remain unresolved that residual negative emotions are carried forward into the next episode, so that rage is dominant in Episodes 2 and 3. This carryover of negative emotion spirals with more resources being threatened, propelling the customer into rage. The authors offer a methodological contribution demonstrating the dynamic nature of appraisals and emotions in a sequence of related episodes in the elicitation of rage. Finally, differences between U. S. and Thai responses are discussed with important theoretical and managerial implications.
