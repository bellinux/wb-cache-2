40|$|For just {{perceptible}} interference, an FM <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> {{interfering with}} another FM <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> {{must have an}} average signal power that is 26 to 37 db less than the wanted signal power. For an AM-VSB <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> interfering with an FM <b>television</b> <b>signal,</b> the AM-VSB television's sync peak average power must be 18 to 31 db below the FM <b>television</b> <b>signal's</b> average power. Also, when an FM <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> interferes with an AM-VSB signal, the average signal power of the FM signal should be 56 to 59 db below the sync peak average power of the AM-VSB <b>television</b> <b>signal.</b> The range of power ratios occur {{as a result of}} different TV scenes used in the tests and different FM-signal frequency deviations used. All tests were performed using 525 line, system M, color-television signals...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{transmission}} of a wideband high-definition <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> involves data rate reduction. Three dimensional subsampling can be applied. In {{order to avoid}} aliasing when reconstructing the signal in the receiver, pre- and postfiltering is performed {{with respect to the}} sampling pattern. Motion adaptive filter accommodate the three dimensional spectrum of the <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> under consideration of the human visual system. The paper describes work on motion-detection in the postfilter. An algorithm for improved motion detection by applying three dimensional signal processing is presented. Thus the performance of the motion-detector and consequently the movement adaptive reconstruction of subsampled <b>television</b> <b>signals</b> have been significantly improved...|$|R
