2500|$|The USAF SR-71 Blackbird {{strategic}} {{reconnaissance aircraft}} made {{frequent use of}} air-to-air refueling. Indeed, design considerations of the aircraft made its mission impossible without aerial refueling. Based at Beale AFB in central California, SR-71s had to be forward deployed to Europe and Japan prior to flying actual reconnaissance missions. These trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights during deployment were impossible without aerial refueling. The SR-71's designers traded takeoff performance for better high-speed, high-altitude performance, necessitating takeoff with less-than-full fuel tanks from even the longest runways. Once airborne, the Blackbird would accelerate to supersonic speed using afterburners to facilitate structural heating and expansion. The magnitude of temperature changes experienced by the SR-71, from parked to its maximum speed, resulted in significant expansion of its structural parts in cruise flight. To allow for the expansion, the Blackbird's parts had to fit loosely when cold, so loosely, in fact, that the Blackbird constantly leaked fuel before heating expanded the airframe enough to seal its fuel tanks. Following the supersonic dash, and to stop the fuel leaks, the SR-71 would then rendezvous with a tanker to fill its now nearly empty tanks before proceeding on its mission. This {{was referred to as}} the LTTR (for [...] "Launch To Tanker Rendezvous") profile. [...] LTTR had the added advantage of providing an operational test of the Blackbird's refueling capability within minutes after takeoff, enabling a Return-To-Launch-Site abort capability if necessary. At its most efficient altitude and speed, the Blackbird was capable of flying for many hours without refueling. The SR-71 used a special fuel, JP-7, with a very high flash point to withstand the extreme skin temperatures generated during Mach 3+ cruise flight. [...] While JP-7 could be used by other aircraft, its burn characteristics posed problems in certain situations (such as high-altitude, <b>emergency</b> <b>engine</b> starts) that made it less than optimal for aircraft other than the SR-71.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the tight}} filming schedule, Universal Studios {{decided to build}} the vehicle entirely from scratch {{according}} to the Los Angeles County Fire Department's specifications at that time. After the filming of Emergency!, Universal Studios donated Squad 51, and it {{was used as a}} reserve paramedic vehicle by the LACOFD. In 1999 the title was transferred, and Squad 51 was then donated to the Los Angeles County Fire Museum in Bellflower, California. In the same year it was thoroughly and completely restored by the museum, at a cost of approximately $10,000. Squad 51 is now residing with its co-star in <b>Emergency!,</b> <b>Engine</b> 51, which completed restoration in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Large Betriebswerke {{often had}} two or three roundhouses with their {{associated}} turntables. The roundhouse was reliant on the turntable; if it became incapacitated the entire shed was out of commission because locomotives could not be run {{in or out of}} it. The turntable therefore had an <b>emergency</b> <b>engine</b> which used compressed air. Over the course of time, a standard turntable with a 26m long track was adopted.Turntables were always {{at the mercy of the}} weather and in very heavy use, so they had to be serviced at regular intervals. In fact every Bahnbetriebswerk with a turntable should also have had a triangle or wye, so that if the turntable was out of action, locomotives could still be turned. However, because wyes needed a lot of space they were only rarely built.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the Luftwaffe had at its {{disposal}} a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed 13mm (.51in) MG 131 in the now fully enclosed dorsal position (B-Stand); the gunner in the latter was now protected with armoured glass. The single MG 15 in the ventral C-Stand or Bola was also replaced, with a belt-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained the single MG 15s, but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z as well; this latter arrangement was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed, and an 835L (221US gal) fuel tanks installed in its place. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five 250kg (550lb) bombs. Additional armour plating was fitted around crew spaces, some {{of it on the}} lower fuselage and could be jettisoned in an <b>emergency.</b> <b>Engines</b> were two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a 2,000kg (4,410lb) payload to a range of 2,340km (1,450mi). Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by {{the summer of}} 1943.|$|R
40|$|Noise and {{performance}} test {{results are presented}} for a full-scale advanced design rectangular array lobe jet suppressor nozzle (plain wall and corrugated). Flight design and installation considerations are also discussed. Noise data are presented in terms of peak PNLT (perceived noise level, tone corrected) suppression relative to the existing airplane and one-third octave-band spectra. Nozzle performance is presented in terms of velocity coefficient.

30|$|A very {{important}} engineering problem is estimating the deformation and stresses in polymer O-rings. O-rings are sealing elements {{that can be}} used in demanding seal applications over a broad pressure and temperature range. They are easy to assemble, and readily available but require some attention to prevent application problems. See, for example (Ritcher 2016), for a list of specific O-rings failure traces with the damage-causing mechanisms. Polymer O-rings are widely used as seal elements in engineering practice in general and in airplane engines in particular and their deformation is {{very important}}, especially due to the fact that seal breakage could lead to the severe oil leakage. As an example from the aerospace industry, failure of the seals could result in engine shutdown and flights that must continue on one remaining engine. During installation, O-ring seals are usually stretched and twisted. Twist can result in an elastic instability for which the shape of the deformed O-ring has more than one equilibrium state. If the O-ring is set on a rigid cylinder, its shape is defined and additional stresses, sometimes very localized, arise. Any instability can place the O-ring in a higher energy state than the original zero deformation reference state that is nevertheless stable. The deformed state of this elastic material causes residual stresses well above what would be predicted for a lower energy state which can lead to cracking of the O-ring. Of course, additional thermal stresses may appear due to heating. This is especially important because the thermal expansion coefficient for rubber-like materials is negative, and the heating of the installed ring will cause additional non-proportional stretching. Hence, for example, in gas turbine engines improper installation can lead to premature seal failure followed by an <b>emergency</b> <b>engine</b> shut down.|$|E

30|$|Communications {{are shown}} {{here to be}} a {{valuable}} tool {{that can be used}} to analyse team dynamics, and develop an understanding of how information flows between operator stations. In this research, we have demonstrated a clear pattern of communications surrounding an <b>emergency</b> event (<b>engine</b> failure), and have identified the Pilot and Tugs as the parties most active during the emergency. It should be noted here, however, that the collection of communications data were relatively effort-intensive, and that standard methods of analysis have yet to be developed. The methodology used in the present Simulation 2 required five researchers for data collection, and considerable time transcribing verbal dialog; the recording phase was especially tricky given the speed at which communications were carried out during the emergency manoeuvres. An analysis of the recorded audio could facilitate this process, but would have its own drawbacks, accordingly.|$|R
50|$|During your flight, {{you control}} {{every aspect of}} the bomber from each of the seven crew {{positions}}: Pilot, Front Gunner, Tail Gunner, Bomb Aimer, Navigator, Engineer, and Squadron Leader.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of a proposed configuration of a high-speed civil transport was conducted by using NASA and industry research pilots. The assessment was conducted to evaluate operational aspects of the configuration from a pilot's perspective, with the primary goal being to identify potential deficiencies in the configuration. The configuration was evaluated within and at {{the limits of the}} design operating envelope to determine the suitability of the configuration to maneuver in a typical mission as well as in emergency or envelope-limit conditions. The Cooper-Harper rating scale was used to evaluate the flying qualities of the configuration. A summary flying qualities metric was also calculated. The assessment was performed in the Langley six-degree-of-freedom Visual Motion Simulator. The effect of a restricted cockpit field-of-view due to obstruction by the vehicle nose was not included in this study. Tasks include landings, takeoffs, climbs, descents, overspeeds, coordinated turns, and recoveries from envelope limit excursions. <b>Emergencies</b> included <b>engine</b> failures, loss of stability augmentation, engine inlet unstarts, and emergency descents. Minimum control speeds and takeoff decision, rotation, and safety speeds were also determined...|$|R
25|$|The first {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} original Tu-154, the A model, in production since 1974, added center-section fuel tanks and more <b>emergency</b> exits, while <b>engines</b> were upgraded to higher-thrust Kuznetsov NK-8-2U. Other upgrades include automatic flaps/slats and stabilizer controls and modified avionics. Max. takeoff weight – 94,000 kg (207,235 lb). There were 15 different interior layouts for the different domestic and international customers of the airplane, seating between 144 and 152 passengers.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{the details of}} a sensitivity study in which the variation in a commercial aircraft engine's outputs is observed for perturbations in its operating condition inputs or control parameters. This study seeks {{to determine the extent to}} which various controller limits can be modified to improve engine performance, while capturing the increased risk that results from the changes. In an <b>emergency,</b> the <b>engine</b> may be required to produce additional thrust, respond faster, or both, to improve the survivability of the aircraft. The objective of this paper is to propose changes to the engine controller and determine the costs and benefits of the additional capabilities produced by the engine. This study indicates that the aircraft engine is capable of producing additional thrust, but at the cost of an increased risk of an engine failure due to higher turbine temperatures and rotor speeds. The engine can also respond more quickly to transient commands, but this action reduces the remaining stall margin to possibly dangerous levels. To improve transient response in landing scenarios, a control mode known as High Speed Idle is proposed that increases the responsiveness of the engine and conserves stall margi...|$|R
