5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} a {{familiar}} figure {{in the streets of}} Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students <b>knew.</b> <b>When</b> word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E
5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> we were making it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works”.|$|E
25|$|Other open {{questions}} of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals {{are responsible for}} the direction of shoal movement. In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of golden shiner (a kind of minnow) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> and where food was available.|$|E

25|$|Having {{seen the}} disaster, Henry Charles ran to Rocky Point, {{where there was}} a {{telephone}} link to the quarantine station at William Head. The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. They blew the emergency whistle, and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam up, because they never <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> a ship might arrive.) When they got there, they cruised around in the dark for about two hours looking for bodies or wreckage, but found none.|$|E

500|$|For {{the main}} characters, Bigelow {{made a point}} of casting {{relatively}} unknown actors: [...] "it underscored the tension because with the lack of familiarity also comes a sense of unpredictability." [...] Renner's character, Sergeant First Class William James, is a composite character, with qualities based on individuals whom screenwriter Boal <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> embedded with the bomb squad. Bigelow cast Renner based on his work in Dahmer, a film about Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious serial killer whose victims were boys. To prepare for the film, Renner spent a week living and training at Fort Irwin, a U.S. military reservation in the Mojave Desert in California. He was taught to use C4 explosives, learned how to render safe improvised explosive devices, and how to wear a bomb suit.|$|E

[...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background.

I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told me about how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E

[...] About six weeks after the semester began, Giovanni {{wrote a letter to}} then-department head Lucinda Roy, who removed Cho from the class. Roy alerted the student affairs office, the dean's office, and the campus police, but each office responded that there was nothing they could do if Cho made no overt threats against himself or others.

500|$|The final {{color was}} violet, a color Meyer disliked {{but had to}} go ahead with, because his first choice—red—would almost {{certainly}} earn the film an [...] "R" [...] rating from the MPAA. The initial killing of the Klingon in the transporter room as the assassins beam aboard was the testing ground for tweaking {{the color of the}} blood and how it would move around the room. Most of the blood droplets were [...] "blobbies", groups of spheres smoothed together by computer, creating a continuous shape. The further apart the spheres, the more the shape could stretch and even break apart. The phasers used in the scene and throughout the film were redesigned versions of earlier models and were first used in The Final Frontier. The props featured blue lights that turned on when the trigger was pressed, so effects artists <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> to add the phaser beam effects.|$|E

[...] McCay was to make use of such framing devices throughout his career, as in Little Nemo where the reader could rely on the protagonist awakening in the closing panel each week. Scott Bukatman and Thierry Smolderen saw the monotony of Sammy Sneeze as an attempt by McCay at parody—one that, in Smolderen's words, [...] "chuckles at the absurdity of... doing the same thing ad nauseam". Noah Berlatsky objected to the idea, calling the strip [...] "excessive and infantile, linked, not to a sense of irony, but a sense of wonder", which he compared to the [...] "eternal appetite of infancy" [...] that G.K. Chesterton in Orthodoxy (1908) attributed to the Christian God.|$|E

500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, ABC {{announced}} that Dick Clark {{would return to}} New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would {{be joined by a}} new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> I was on other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve." [...] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.|$|E

[...] In a December 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lee acknowledged that she had transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for Frozen to having to apologize when they said [...] "we're still listening to those songs" [...] (with their children). Lee also said that she used the film and its strong female characters to inspire her own daughter, who had experienced bullying at school, and admitted that she herself as a child was bullied as well; thus, they had managed to be true to themselves like Anna and Elsa.|$|E
