5|$|The Grand Tour is an Amazon Video {{original}} {{series and}} is exclusive to Amazon Prime members. It {{was scheduled for}} a 18 November 2016 release at 00:01 GMT, but was released an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> on 17 November at 23:00 GMT instead. The opening weekend for the episode attracted about 1,954,000 viewers in the 18–49 age range, tripling that of The Man in the High Castle, another show on Amazon Video. Non-Prime members were able to watch the episode for free from 23 to 26 December.|$|E

While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier,</b> at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E

The third and fourth episode were viewed by 2.5 million viewers each, while the final, aired an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> at 8:00pm Eastern Standard Time, drew 2.1 million viewers.

5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Graduados was a ratings success, scoring nearly 28 points. Subsequent episodes {{continued}} to receive high ratings and El Trece, Telefe's main rival for prime-time ratings, competed with Graduados by moving its blockbuster program Showmatch an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> (opposite Graduados). The move was unsuccessful, with Graduados more highly rated than Showmatch {{before and after}} the change. Showmatch returned to its original time slot and El Trece aired a new series, Sos mi hombre, opposite Graduados. Sos mi hombres premiere episode was outscored by Graduados, 26 to 18.4; according to El Trece this was not a disappointment, since its target rating was 17-19 points. Graduados maintained its lead in the ratings {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Hutchinson chose Gromek as {{his opening}} day starter for the 1954 season against the former St. Louis Browns {{in their first}} game as the Baltimore Orioles, using the starter with the most {{experience}} {{in order to get}} the Tigers to start the season strong; he shut them out on seven hits in a 3–0 win. After his first four games, he developed a reputation for his quick pitching, with baseball games ending half an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> on average on days he pitched. On May 9, his complete game eleven inning victory over the Chicago White Sox improved Gromek's record to 5–0 with a 1.72 ERA, making him the first pitcher in the league with five wins. He also became the first to seven wins in mid-May, but then went on five-game losing streak, not winning game eight until June 15 against the Red Sox. For the season, Gromek had 18 wins, 16 losses, a 2.74 ERA, and 102 strikeouts in 252.2 innings pitched and 36 games, 32 of them starts. He led the Tigers in wins, losses, ERA, and innings pitched, and his ERA and innings pitched were both ranked fifth in the AL.|$|E
5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier.</b> Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E

25|$|This was the flight's second {{attempted}} take-off: over an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier,</b> {{the pilots}} had attempted and aborted a departure because a sensor reported excessive temperatures {{in an air}} intake; that sensor was de-activated on the ground (reportedly an established procedure, as that sensor was redundant for that flight).

25|$|As a {{historic}} memento to {{victory over the}} Swedish army in 1645, the local Petrov Cathedral rings noon an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier,</b> at 11o'clock because the locals and Swedish army were in stalemate and the Swedish general said he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon; the bell ringer tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early.

25|$|Following {{suit with}} the rest Network Ten, CTC moved Capital Eyewitness News an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier</b> to 5pm in February 1992. The 'First at Five' slogan was emblazoned across Canberra on buses and in {{newspaper}} ads. The move to 5pm gave Network Ten an edge in other cities against its rival news bulletins. In Canberra {{there were no other}} local/national/international bulletins on air, but the half-hour 6pm local news on rival WIN was proving popular. However, in both a testament to the loyalty of its audience and a question mark over the wisdom of management, the 'First at Five' move was met with fierce protest by viewers. Not only had the beloved 'Channel 7 News' as it was colloquially known been moved an <b>hour</b> <b>earlier,</b> but the 6pm-7pm slot had been filled by the tabloid current affairs programme Hinch and the low-budget American dating show Studs. Canberra was having none of it and CTC restored the bulletin to 6pm after just six weeks. Bus ads were hastily amended with stickers covering the timeslot noting the news was 'First at Six'.|$|E
