These may be found on acid sedimentary rock such as sandstone; acid igneous rock such as granite; and fluvial or glacial deposits such as sand and gravel. Typical plants of lowland acid grassland in Britain include common bent grass, Agrostis capillaris, wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, bristle bent grass, Agrostis curtisii, tormentil, Potentilla erecta, and flowers such as sheep's sorrel, Rumex acetosella and heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile.|$|E
50|$|In general these {{soils are}} <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> <b>lime,</b> magnesia, phosphates, nitrogen, humus and potash. Intense {{leaching}} is {{a menace to}} these soils. On the uplands, they are thin, poor and gravelly, sandy, or stony and porous, light-colored soils on which food crops like bajra can be grown. But on the lower plains and valleys they are rich, deep, dark colored fertile loam on which, under irrigation, they can produce excellent crops like cotton, wheat, pulses, tobacco, jowar, linseed, millet, potatoes and fruits. These are also characterized by stunted forest growth and are suited to dry farming.|$|E

The Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station Is receiving a great many Inquiries about the subject and farmers are quite generally anxious to know whether or not they may apply lime to their lands with profit. That Is so partly because the practice Is being urged for the small areas of slightly acid soils that are found here and there In the state and partly because of the extensive work In other states to restore fertility to soils that are seriously short of lime...|$|E

40|$|The farming of {{foothill}} {{country is}} carried out over {{the entire length of}} the South Island. The area consists of those lower hills and undulating clay downs most of which are ploughable. It is situated between the plains or lowlands of the eastern coastline- and the high, steep, unploughable tussock, scrub, and mountainous country which extends westward to the Main Divide. It is commonly known as the browntop belt on account of this dominant species, which forms the main soil coverage. The area of the browntop belt in Canterbury alone comprises some ¾ million acres. The altitude varies from a few hundred feet to some 1, 600 to 2600 ft. The rainfall is variable. In the higher altitudes it is as high as 30 ins. to 50 ins. Winters in these higher altitudes are severe and long with late spring growth. Also occasional falls of snow are experienced most winters. Under the conditions of high rainfall cultivation is difficult and because of its clay nature the soil remains saturated for long periods. In some parts wind blowing of the more silty soils restricts cultivation activities. These soils are low <b>in</b> humus and <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> phosphate and <b>lime.</b> As such they grow poor pastures of acid-tolerating species of browntop, sweet vernal, and Yorkshire fog, but browntop predominates. Such pastures are suited only to store sheep production and give a relatively low carrying capacity...|$|R

40|$|VI. Changes of {{amino acid}} in the calf skin by liming The changes of amino acid {{both in the}} calf skin and <b>lime</b> solution, <b>in</b> the process of liming were {{examined}} chiefly by paper chromatography. The results were as follows: 1) Amino acids, detected in the calf skin at the early stage of liming were of sixteen kinds, such as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, serine, phenylalanine, cystine, tyrosine, histidine, threonine, arginine lysine, asparatic acid, glutamic acid, proline, and oxyproline. Three of these amino acid, cystine, threonine and histidine, vanished after 10 or 15 days of liming, while thirteen other amino acids were detected even after the skin had been soaked for 20 days. 2) By liming some sorts of amino acid of the calf skin were dissolved <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution. Most of these amino acids construct soluble portion, such as albumines, globuline, mucoid and so on. Most of them are presumed to have been dissolved <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution by 10 th day or so after soaking <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution, considering {{the rise and fall}} of the quantity of volatile ammonia <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution, and the kind of amino acids soluble <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution. 3) Insoluble protein in the skin is also being resolved gradually by saturated lime solution, and it is considered that the diesoluble ammount of amino acid should increase if it was soaked <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution for a long time. That is to say, the chief amino acid composing collagen, lysine, arginine, proline and oxyproline were surely detected after the skin was soaked for about 20 days. 4) Gelatin can be obtained by heating collagen fibre with water. In this case most important point to make fine quality of gelatin is that the collagen, not yet resolved and as pure as possible, should be used as materials. Considering this experiment and results written in the preceding chapters, it is deducted that the skin should be soaked <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution for about 20 days at 18 C for the purpose of making gelatin from calf skin. VII. Studies on the relation between the period of liming and the quality of leather and gelatin In order to investigate the relation between the period of liming and the quality of leather and gelatin, the calf skin was soaked <b>in</b> the saturated <b>lime</b> solution at 183 C, and the leather and gelatin were made one after another. 1) The calf skin was tanned rather well after it was soaked <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution for 6 or 10 days. The best quality leather was that which remained <b>in</b> the <b>lime</b> solution for 8 days. The tention strength and the section of this leather were best. 2) Gelatin made from the calf skin after it had been sosked for 20 days <b>in</b> <b>lime</b> solution, was the best in quality. The suitable period of liming of calf skin to make gelatin is from 17 to 23 days at 18 ℃. 3) As the results of this research, it proved, what the writer mensioned in the preceding chapters, not to be mistaken...|$|R
