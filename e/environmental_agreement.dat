On the other hand, Niue currently deals with one of the highest rates of greenhouse gas production per capita in the world (second only to Kuwait and Brunei). In 2015, Niue started providing phone landlines to all of its inhabitants. In 2008, Niue {{became the first}} country in the world where laptops are provided to all school students. A small and highly democratic nation, Niueans enjoy high freedom, and elections are held every 3 years. There are no political parties in Niue; all assembly members are independents. The last and only Niuean political party to have ever existed, the Niue People's Party (1987–2003), won once (in 2002) before being disbanded the following year.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{transnational}} <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> {{on climate}} change. As the Paris agreement of 2015 contains no binding emission reduction targets for nation states, understanding {{other forms of}} cooperation as complements to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process becomes increasingly important. We thus aim to identify directions for further research on agreements with heterogeneous contracting parties. By building on empirical examples of emerging transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements,</b> and on insights from the global governance literature, we discuss the scope and limits of the current economic literature on international <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements.</b> We argue that further game theoretical research would benefit from extending the analysis (i) to consider actors that are not nation state governments, and (ii) to consider multiple <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> that are in force at the same time. We underpin this claim by suggesting two proposals for economic models that analyze climate clubs and city alliances. The results show that transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> can be individually rational and can improve the effectiveness of climate policies...|$|R

Using a stylized model, we show that adaptive measures can be used strategically and that their inclusion in <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> enhances agreement stability and can even lead to full cooperation. However, adaptation does not help cooperation in mitigation policies. Finally, we evaluate how including adaptive measures for climate change in international <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> affects welfare and overall pollution...|$|R
