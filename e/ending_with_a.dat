A typical pattern for a simple song might be as follows: <b>a</b> phrase <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cadence on the tonic, <b>a</b> second phrase <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> half cadence, then a final, longer, phrase <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{authentic}} cadence on the tonic.|$|R
5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse.

5|$|Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon has {{garnered}} press through lawsuits regarding its financing. Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority (GEDCA) gave a $800,000 {{loan guarantee}} to producer John F. S. Laing, which was forfeited {{as the film}} failed to recoup the investment. GEDCA alleged Laing defrauded them, while he claimed Guam authorities promised him funding he did not receive.

5000|$|A {{very curious}} and {{interesting}} peculiarity {{of a certain}} sort of Irish verse is a desire to <b>end</b> <b>a</b> second line <b>with</b> <b>a</b> word <b>with</b> <b>a</b> syllable more than that which ends the first, {{the stress of the}} voice being thrown back a syllable in the last word of the second line. Thus, if the first line <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> accented monosyllable, the second line will <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dissyllabic word accented on its first syllable, or if the first line <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dissyllable accented on its penultimate the second line will <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> trisyllable accented on its ante-penultimate.

5|$|Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words (Lieder ohne Worte), eight cycles each {{containing}} six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain {{his most}} famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer's lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity has itself caused many critics to underrate their musical value. Other composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own, included Charles-Valentin Alkan (his five sets of Chants, each <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> barcarole), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles, and Edvard Grieg.|$|E

Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards {{to a handful of}} particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E

In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when offensive linemen Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped the Bills win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who had said he was indecisive, did not use his players properly and was not a good play-caller.|$|E

5|$|Purandara Dasa (1484–1564), a {{wandering}} bard {{who visited}} Vijayanagara {{during the reign}} of King Achyuta Raya, is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages, although only about 1,000 songs are known today. Composed in various ragas, and often <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> salutation to the Hindu deity Vittala, his compositions presented the essence of the Upanishads and the Puranas in simple yet expressive language. He also devised a system by which the common man could learn Carnatic music, and codified the musical composition forms svaravalis, alankaras and geethams. Owing to his contributions in music, Purandara Dasa earned the honorific Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ("Father of Carnatic Music").|$|E
5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate.

Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|Survivors is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC. It depicts {{the lives of a}} group of people who survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most of the human species. According to the producers, the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors (1975–1977), created by Terry Nation, but rather is loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme. Two series were produced of the new show: series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November–December 2008, and series 2 ran in January–February 2010, <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cliffhanger. The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that, due to poor viewing figures and other considerations, Survivors had been cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1997 college {{football}} season having gone 102 the previous season, <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4121 loss to Nebraska in the 1996 Orange Bowl.

Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with the first pick in the 2001 NFL Draft, and there were questions about how well the team would cope with the loss of Vick and several other important players. Despite those fears, the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference.|$|E
