5|$|While {{predictions}} of the future can never be absolutely certain, present understanding in various fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> outline. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.|$|E

5|$|The {{judicial}} establishment, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense, {{is composed}} of qadis, who give binding judgements in specific court cases, and muftis {{and other members of}} the ulema, who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions (fatwas). The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country; his opinions are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary. The judiciary proper (that is, the body of qadis) {{is composed of}} about 700 judges, a relatively small number (according to critics) for a country of over 23 million.|$|E

25|$|A hallucination, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> {{sense of}} the word, is a {{perception}} {{in the absence of}} a stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.|$|E
25|$|These {{stories were}} written from 1887 to 1897 for the {{magazine}} Der Gute Kamerad. Most of the stories are set in the Wild West, but Old Shatterhand is just a figure and not the first-person narrator as {{he is in the}} travel stories. The best known volume is Der Schatz im Silbersee. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense the early works Im fernen Westen and Der Waldläufer belong to these category.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} is {{a general}} form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense, it {{is the study of}} how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).|$|E

25|$|According to the Russian Census of 2010, the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts, located entirely {{east of the}} Ural Mountains, {{together}} have {{a population}} of about 25.6 million. Tyumen and Kurgan Oblasts, which are geographically in Siberia but administratively part of the Urals Federal District, together have {{a population of about}} 4.3 million. Thus, the whole region of Asian Russia (or Siberia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> usage of the term) is home to approximately 30 million people. It has a population density of about three people per square kilometre.|$|E

Their fundamental and applied research is relevant to a huge range of real world problems ranging from the dynamics of fish populations in the North Sea to the mechanics of liquid crystals and the growth of cancer cells, and several of our staff are working directly on immediate practical problems such as the spread of infectious diseases via joint appointments in a variety of government agencies.|$|E

Corbett was a keen {{investor}} and trader and the only real politician – <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense – among the merchants of 1851. Corbett was at various times City treasurer of Portland, member of the city council, {{and chairman of the}} Republican State central committee. Elected as a Republican to the United States Senate, he served from March 4, 1867 to March 3, 1873, although Josiah Failing was an Oregon delegate at the second convention that re-nominated Abraham Lincoln and the following one that chose Grant (and he also served as a Republican state chairman).|$|E

25|$|The International Society of Military Sciences (ISMS) is an {{international}} organization whose stated aim {{is to build a}} strong network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts. The ISMS was founded in October 2008. The Austrian National Defence Academy, the Royal Military College of Canada, the Royal Danish Defence College, the Finnish National Defence University, the Netherlands Defence Academy, the Norwegian Defence University College, the Swedish National Defence College and the Baltic Defence College established this society with the intention to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense.|$|E
25|$|An {{expression}} {{system is a}} system specifically designed {{for the production of}} a gene product of choice. This is normally a protein although may also be RNA, such as tRNA or a ribozyme. An {{expression system}} consists of a gene, normally encoded by DNA, and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using the reagents provided. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense this includes every living cell but the term is more normally used to refer to expression as a laboratory tool. An expression system is therefore often artificial in some manner. Expression systems are, however, a fundamentally natural process. Viruses are an excellent example where they replicate by using the host cell as an expression system for the viral proteins and genome.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{the style}} {{that was to}} become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at {{about the time that}} the first fully Renaissance {{buildings}} were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England, after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> sense with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved {{in the direction of the}} Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.|$|E
