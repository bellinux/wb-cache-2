2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired,</b> I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E

6000|$|Her face clouded again. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> {{of having}} {{people look at}} me and shrug and whisper. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of having this {{abnormal}} thing reflected in the eyes of all my visitors. I wish I could become commonplace--without the slightest thing queer about me. Sometimes I feel like taking a dose of poison and ending it all." ...|$|R
60|$|ELLIE [almost in tears]. Oh, please! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired.</b> <b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>been</b> glad of anything.|$|R
60|$|Why, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> {{of looking}} out of the window. It is all the same: fields and hedges, hedges and fields; and I want to talk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I did not, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> when I {{came back}} from poor John Ray's funeral, that I thought I would take a holiday, and sleep at home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of you,’ returns Rosa. But {{she quickly}} adds, and pleadingly too, seeing displeasure in his face: ‘Dear Eddy, {{you were just}} as tired of me, you know.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was, such a {{long summer}} day, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of myself. I went to my boxes next. I looked over the large box first, which I usually leave open; and then I tried the small box, which I always keep locked.|$|E
60|$|You {{have not}} {{a key to}} the cypher of this at least, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that one word seems {{tumbling}} over another all the way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, my dear Loo. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> wonder I don't say {{anything}} to get to sleep. Go to bed, go to bed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> Tom; we {{will have}} a look the first thing in the morning. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> now <b>I</b> would not dig for it if it were gold." ...|$|R
60|$|The rest I {{certainly}} needed, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> I {{could scarcely}} untie the pack {{to get out}} the blankets. The bear cub showed signs or weariness, which pleased me. It was not long after Hiram's departure that I sank into a doze.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I'd {{like to see}} Teddy again, and you; {{and then}} I {{was going back to}} my old work in the city, only <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> I went to sleep on the hay. I'd have been gone in the morning, if you hadn't found me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am very sorry,' {{said little}} Hans, rubbing {{his eyes and}} pulling off his night-cap, 'but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, {{and listen to the}} birds singing. Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Paul, sighing; [...] "when Florence was {{as little}} as me, she was strong and tall, and did not get tired of playing as <b>I</b> do. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> sometimes, papa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt, that Mr. M'Gabbery <b>is</b> an ass. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sure he has}} ears if {{one could}} only see them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of him. Don't you think we could get on to Damascus to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It looks a very comfable house," [...] Bruno said, as {{we turned}} into the road leading up to it. [...] "I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us, <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> and hungry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you have}} a good time last night? I tried to stay awake until you came home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> I fell asleep. I hope you didn't disturb your aunt, Diana." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} North Wind, [...] "I {{know where it}} is. I once blew an aspen leaf there, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that for many days {{afterward}} I {{was not able to}} blow at all. However, if you really are anxious to go there, and are not afraid to go with me, I will take you on my back, and try if I can blow you there." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{just threw}} myself {{heart and soul}} into the {{preparations}} for that dinner. I had three turkeys and two sucking pigs, and mince pies and pumpkin pies and apple pies, and doughnuts and fruit cake and cranberry sauce and brown bread, and ever {{so many other things}} to fill up the chinks. The night before Thanksgiving everything was ready, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> I could hardly talk to Jimmy Nelson when he dropped in.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's better," [...] said Grandfather Frog gruffly. [...] "Always {{tell the}} truth. The fact <b>is</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tired.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that I'm {{going to sleep}} for the winter, and I'm {{going to do it}} this very day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Asph. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> {{with the}} weight of gold [...] I bore to-day I could not budge a foot [...] To see the finest sight Jove could display. [...] But tell us, Lacon, what he did and said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please sing to me; any humdrum air will do. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired,</b> and yet <b>I</b> cannot sleep. If my {{head would}} only stop this dreadful {{thinking}} {{and let me}} forget one hour it would do me so much good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one shall part us, mamma; and if I {{can only}} get {{something}} to do we can be independent and happy in spite of our losses; for now the first shock and worry is over, I find a curious sort of excitement in being poor and having to work for my living. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of pleasure and idleness I really quite long to work at something, if I could only find it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that I slept {{nearly all}} day arter I 'ad got 'ome, and I 'ad no sooner {{got back to}} the wharf in the evening than I see that the {{landlord}} 'ad been busy. If there was one silly fool that asked me the best way of making mud-pies, I should think there was fifty. Little things please little minds, and the silly way some of 'em went on made me feel sorry for my sects.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid Aunt Becky {{would think}} so. She's awful pious, and boxed my ears with a psalm-book last Sabbath, when I said I wished the lions would bite Daniel in the den, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of seeing them stare and roar at him. She wouldn't {{let me look}} at the {{pictures}} in the big Bible another minute, and gave me a long hymn to learn, shut up in the back bed-room. She's a godly woman, Deacon Hurd says; but I think she's uncommon strict." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go, please," [...] she begged. [...] "I am feeling lonely to-night and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of {{everybody}} and everything. Take me to supper at the Café de Paris. Then, if you like, we {{might come back}} here for half-an-hour. Or--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would be}} the good of that, mamma? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of looking always at the same paper. It is such a {{tiresome}} paper. It makes one count the pattern over and over again. I wonder how you ever can live here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} glancing through that?" [...] The {{stranger}} drew {{from his pocket}} a folded manuscript. [...] "It will not take you a moment. I ought, of course, to have sent it through the post; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of sending things through the post." ...|$|R
60|$|So I cried a little, {{which was}} natural, I suppose, {{for one of}} my age, and after I was rested I got a basket and started for {{a place on the}} extreme rim of the circle, where the stars were close to the ground and I could get them with my hands, which would be better, anyway, because I could gather them tenderly then, and not break them. But it was farther than I thought, and at last I had go give it up; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> I couldn't drag my feet another step; and besides, they were sore and hurt me very much.|$|E
60|$|I turned in, as we seamen say, all standing. The {{meaning of}} that is, I did not pull my clothes off--no, not even {{so much as}} my coat: though I did my shoes, for my feet were badly swelled with the deck. There was a little swing-lamp alight in my cabin. I thought, as I looked at it before {{shutting}} my eyes, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of darkness, and troubled by darkness, that I {{could have gone to}} sleep best {{in the midst of a}} million of flaming gas-lights. That was the last thought I had before I went off, except the prevailing thought that I should not be able to get to sleep at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} knew {{by the words}} {{that there was more}} than one boy out with slings, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that it didn't seem as if I could run another inch! When I was knocked into the brook I somehow was turned around, so that I was headed away from home, and we had a long, long {{distance}} to go before there was the littlest kind of a show for safety. It seemed as if matters were just as bad as they could be; but it appears that they were not, for just then who should pop out of some tall grass but my poor little Sonny Bunny, and those dreadful boys so close behind that I could almost hear them breathe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All Saints' Terrace, New Road, London, July 28th, Monday night.--I {{can hardly}} hold my head up, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired.</b> But in my situation, I dare not trust {{anything}} to memory. Before I go to bed, I must write my customary {{record of the}} events of the day.|$|R
60|$|Long {{afterwards}} I learnt {{the history}} of that interview, and of many others which had gone before it; and so I shall again have the pleasure of dropping that first personal pronoun of which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired,</b> and of relating the story as it was told to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go, Prue, I'll go; and {{you shall}} <b>be</b> satisfied. But <b>I</b> {{thought we might}} go from here in style, and then slip off on some quieter trip. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>I</b> dread the idea of frolicking for a whole month, as Mark and Jessie mean to do." ...|$|R
