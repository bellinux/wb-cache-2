40|$|Increasing {{competition}} from foreign imports and rising fuel prices have seriously threatened the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery. If {{the industry is}} to survive, fishermen must receive more money for their shrimp. This crisis presents an opportunity to address the environmental degradation caused by shrimp trawling, {{while at the same}} time providing economic stability for fishermen. By marketing their shrimp as both American and environmentally friendly, fishermen may be able to increase the price of their shrimp. This study investigates consumer willingness to pay for American and environmentally labeled shrimp using survey methodology., Evidence of increased willingness to pay on the part of consumers may provide the impetus necessary to convince fishermen to change their fishing strategies and earn an <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>label...</b>|$|E
40|$|The public {{perceives}} a certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) to mean {{an environmentally}} friendly fishery, not one {{characterized by the}} “dearth of key data”. Significant data deficiencies lead to conclude that an <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>label</b> for the fishery of Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) is scientifically indefensible. Credible life history data are missing: spawning areas, eggs, and larvae have never been found, spawning intervals are unknown, and most density-dependent aspects of ecological relationships are undetermined. Stock assessment is problematic because severe Antarctic pack ice conditions for more than 9 months a year prevent scientists from effectively using standard models, which require random tagging over time, space, and age classes. The number of fish harvested by illegal, unregulated, and unreported fisheries is likely substantial. Finally, ecosystem effects of removing 50...|$|E

As retailers are increasingly under pressure to ensure that ethical and environmental standards run {{all the way through the}} supply chain, there is a need for research projects to explore best practice and ways forward to improve the competitiveness of the Bangladesh manufacturing sector to add value in this area. The long-term goal of the partnership is to create joint industrial and academic research projects that will champion best practice in the drive for sustainability between the UK and Bangladesh. In addition, the complimentary knowledge gained through these activities will foster new businesses and curriculum models, and support the drive to better industrial practices and policies. These synergies will form and shape an entrepreneurial agenda to support a new generation of talent that will have sustainable values as core business philosophy. The project will help solving some of the problems outlined above and provide new opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas and actions. Opportunities for this project include: • To understand of the concepts of ecological, social and cultural issues in fashion to inform new curriculum development and pedagogy for fashion courses. • To explore the current climate in the fashion industry for more sustainable brands in Bangladesh and UK and identify market synergies. • To examine case studies of eco-fashion leaders and their knowledge, skills and values that support eco-design as central to the product development processes and practices. • To develop international knowledge transfer sharing of eco-friendly local networks, agencies and companies that could be used to showcase new <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>labels...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Reputable <b>eco-friendly</b> {{electricity}} <b>labels</b> (called [...] "brands" [...] in US English?) ensure {{an ecological}} benefit in practice. Some reputable labels (like the WWF co-funded German [...] "ok-power" [...] label) also used RECS, {{but only as}} a broadly-accepted accounting and tracking system (to register the power plants against double-selling); other labels required direct contracts for delivery with the plant as an alternative. The crux of such efforts was to additionally insist that the certificate-selling or directly-contracted power plant met important eco-orientated standards; those standards typically encompassing a maximum age of the power plant (to ensure that new power plants are built) and the banning of power plants that act against landscape or animal protection. Other labels co-issued by environmental organizations required that {{a part of the}} fee of every kWh be donated for investment in new eco-friendly power plants or technology.|$|R
40|$|Hotels {{around the}} world have risen to the {{challenge}} of improving their sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint. Although many groups and customers are demanding sustainability, hotel operators are concerned about whether sustainable hotels increase or decrease their rates and bookings. To answer the question of whether going green hurts or helps revenues, this study used data provided by Sabre to determine the effect on bookings of widespread advertising of eco-certified hotels. Sabre’s Travelocity site uses an <b>eco-friendly</b> hotel <b>label</b> to flag hotels that have earned any of a dozen environmental certifications, including LEED and EnergyStar. Based on an analysis of millions of individual bookings in over 3, 000 eco-certified hotels (and a comparison group of 6, 000 properties), the study finds that, on average, booking revenue neither increased nor decreased for the certified hotels. While this study doesn’t address the situation of any individual hotel, we can conclude that going green is compatible with existing quality standards of hotel service, and that advertising green status doesn’t hurt a hotel’s revenues. Earning a green certification does not automatically result in a large revenue bump nor a revenue fall. In short, green is not a “silver bullet” strategy. Finally, although the average effect is revenue neutral, individual properties have widely varied experiences with eco-certification, depending on their individual situation...|$|R
40|$|Research Question: How can {{the concept}} of Greening Goliaths and Emerging Davids be applied to better {{understand}} the sustainabile transformation of the fashion industry?  Purpose: This paper sets out to analyze two approaches to sustainability within the fashion industry; A firm adopting CSR initiatives into their business strategy versus a sustainable brand. These approaches are explored {{within the framework of}} Greening Goliaths and Emerging Davids to recognize their contribution to the sustainable transformation of the fashion industry. Method: A qualitative approach to our case study was taken in which we analyze and measure the Swedish fast fashion company, H&M and an American <b>eco-friendly</b> fashion <b>label,</b> Reformation. A semi-formal phone interview with an expert on sustainability in the fashion industry gave us further knowledge of how the two approaches can be combined for the industry to become more sustainable. A model was developed that aided the analysis as well as the discussion of the empirical findings. Conclusion: Our conclusions found that the sustainable brand, Reformation can be categorized as an Emerging David and is in the Take-off stage. In order to gain a larger market share an contribute to the sustainable transformation of the industry Reformation will need to continue process innovation to lower their price point. H&M was initially categorized as a Greening Goliath however upon further analysis we believe they are shifting to become and Environmental David leading the sustainable transformation of the industry. In order for a sustainable transformation of the fashion industry {{there needs to be a}} co-evolution of both Greening Goliaths and Emerging Davids working together for a sustainable future...|$|R
