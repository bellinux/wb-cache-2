40|$|Interest in NOX {{pollution}} reduction {{has led to}} novel combustion techniques including Lean Premixed Prevaporized (LPP) combustion. However, LPP combustion {{is inherently}} prone to instabilities {{which can lead to}} gas turbine <b>engine</b> <b>blowout</b> and engine component failure. While these instabilities previously have been studied in simple laboratory burners, {{there is a need to}} show the connection between these lab scales and the instabilities that occur when a realistic, commercial LPP multi-swirl fuel injector is operated with Jet-A fuel at elevated pressures, temperatures and mass flow rates (such as in the present study). In order to investigate the combustion instabilities in an LPP combustor, a realistic test rig was modified to test two similar commercial LPP fuel injectors using liquid Jet-A fuel at high pressures and high pre-heat temperatures. Three groups of instabilities were identified based on the frequency of the pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber: high frequency (> 250 Hz), low frequency (50 - 200 Hz), and very low frequency (< 50 Hz). The low frequency and very low frequency oscillations were further investigated through the use of simultaneous high speed video and pressure data. Additionally, the flow field during the low frequency instability was measured through phase averaged particle image velocimetry (PIV). These results show that the flame has a large scale response at both types of frequencies. The low frequency instability was determined to be a Helmholtz bulk mode due to equivalence ratio oscillations from the oscillating air flow through the injector. The very low frequency instability was determined to be a flashback / blowout phenomenon near the lean blowout limit. A mathematical model was proposed which predicts the frequency of the very low frequency instability. The findings of this thesis with regard to the source of combustion instabilities provide data which can guide future studies in this area and designs of advanced, low polluting gas turbines...|$|E
40|$|During a free-jet {{investigation}} of a 28 -inch ram-jet engine at a Mach number of 2. 35, flow pulsation at the engine inlet were discovered which proved {{to have an effect}} on the engine performance and operational characteristics, particularly the <b>engine</b> rich <b>blowout</b> limits. This report discusses the finding of the flow pulsations, their elimination, and effect. Other facility characteristics, such as the establishment of flow simulation and the degree of subcritical operation of the diffuser, are also explained...|$|R
2500|$|On August 2, 2010, a Trent 1000 <b>engine</b> {{suffered}} a <b>blowout</b> at Rolls-Royce's test facility during ground testing. The failure {{due to the}} timeline for installing Trent 1000 engines being reevaluated; on August 27, 2010, Boeing stated that the first delivery to launch customer ANA would be delayed until early 2011. That same month, Boeing faced compensation claims from airlines owing to ongoing delivery delays. In September 2010, {{it was reported that}} a further two 787s might join the test fleet for a total of eight flight test aircraft. [...] On September 10, 2010, a partial engine surge occurred in a Trent engine on ZA001 at Roswell. [...] On October 4, 2010, the sixth 787, ZA006 joined the test program with its first flight.|$|R
