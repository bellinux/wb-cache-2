40|$|The {{isomerization}} of glucose to fructose in {{the presence}} of Sn-containing zeolite BEA (beta polymorph A) was studied by periodic DFT calculations. Focus was placed {{on the nature of the}} active site and the reaction mechanism. The reactivities of the perfect lattice SnIV site and the hydroxylated SnOH species are predicted to be similar. The isomerization activity of the latter can be enhanced by creating an extended silanol nest in its vicinity. Besides the increased Lewis acidity and coordinationflexibility of the Sn center, the enhanced reactivity in this case is ascribed to the reaction environment that promotes activation is ascribed to the reaction environment that promotes activation of the confined sugar intermediates through hydrogen bonding. The resulting multidentate activation of the substrate favors the rate-determining hydrogen-shift reaction.

40|$|Lewis acidic zeolites such as Sn-Beta are {{commonly}} studied {{for use as}} selective catalysts for <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> to fructose in liquid water. Glucose to fructose isomerization is a critical reaction for lignocellulosic biomass upgrading, which converts abundant and renewable feedstocks into commercially desirable fuels and chemicals. Industrial applications require catalysts that maintain optimal reactivity over long time scales, yet at typical reaction temperatures, Lewis acidic Beta zeolites are known to deactivate in liquid water through poorly understood mechanisms. Recent work in our group has shown that interactions between water and Sn-Beta zeolites can cause leaching of active Sn sites from the zeolite framework, and can also hydrolyze siloxane linkages to form silanol groups that also lower catalytic isomerization rates. This study investigates how water exposure and treatment affects the structure of Sn-Beta, by systematically changing the water contact time and analyzing the resulting <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> rates, {{in order to determine}} the catalysts and treatments to maintain optimal reactivity. Functionalization procedures were performed on Sn-Beta using hydrophobic alkylsilane precursors to form an external hydrophobic shell and minimize water diffusion into the zeolite pores. Limiting water contact may slow the deactivation rates caused by active Sn site leaching or silanol group formation. Functionalized zeolites showed a substantial decrease in initial <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> rates compared to that of untreated zeolites, however, reaction rates remain constant for longer time scales after functionalization, suggesting that silylation treatments may improve time-on-stream stability of Sn-Beta catalysts in liquid water...|$|E

At temperature above 180  °C, the isomerization reaction of glucose-fructose occurred much faster, and more HMF was produced during the process, however, based on the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse proposed by Girisuta et al.

The ability of chromium to selectively dehydrate glucose to 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium chloride {{does not depend on}} the oxidation state of chromium. Nevertheless, CrIII exhibits higher activity and selectivity to HMF than CrII. Anhydrous CrCl 2 and CrCl 36 ¿H 2 O readily catalyze glucose dehydration with HMF yields of 60 and 72 ¿%, respectively, after 3 h. Anhydrous CrCl 3 has a lower activity, because it only slowly dissolves in the reaction mixture. The transformation of glucose to HMF involves the formation of fructose as an intermediate. The exceptional catalytic performance of the chromium catalysts is explained by their unique ability to catalyze glucose to fructose isomerization and fructose to HMF dehydration with high selectivity. Side reactions leading to humins by means of condensation reactions take predominantly place during fructose dehydration. The higher HMF selectivity for CrIII is tentatively explained by the higher activity in fructose dehydration compared to CrII. This limits the concentration of intermediates that are involved in bimolecular condensation reactions. Model DFT calculations indicate a substantially lower activation barrier for <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> by CrIII compared to CrII. Qualitatively, <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> follows a similar mechanism for CrII and CrIII.

Similarly, a phosphomannomutase (PMM) converts mannose- 6 -phosphate to mannose- 1 -phosphate. While whole genome sequences of Giardia predict two PGM candidates, no PMM candidate is present. The hypothesis tested here is {{that at least one}} of the two Giardia PGM candidates has both PGM and PMM activity, as has been described for bacterial PGM orthologs. Nondenaturing gels showed that Giardia has two proteins with PGM activity, one of which also has PMM activity. Phylogenetic analyses showed that one of the two Giardia PGM candidates (Gl-PGM 1) shares recent common ancestry with other eukaryotic PGMs, while the other Giardia PGM candidate (Gl-PGM 2) is deeply divergent. Both Gl-PGM 1 and Gl-PGM 2 rescue a Saccharomyces cerevisiae pgm 1 Δ/pgm 2 Δ double deletion strain, while only Gl-PGM 2 rescues a temperature-sensitive PMM mutant of S. cerevisiae (sec 53 -ts).

Glycogen has been identified in other tissues such as brain, heart, kidney, adipose tissue, and erythrocytes, but glycogen function in these tissues is mostly unknown. Glycogen synthesis requires a series of reactions that include glucose entrance into the cell through transporters, phosphorylation of glucose to <b>glucose</b> 6 -phosphate, <b>isomerization</b> to <b>glucose</b> 1 -phosphate, and formation of uridine 5 ʹ-diphosphate-glucose, which is the direct glucose donor for glycogen synthesis. Glycogenin catalyzes {{the formation of a}} short glucose polymer that is extended by the action of glycogen synthase. Glycogen branching enzyme introduces branch points in the glycogen particle at even intervals. Laforin and malin are proteins involved in glycogen assembly but their specific function remains elusive in humans. Glycogen is accumulated in the liver primarily during the postprandial period and in the skeletal muscle predominantly after exercise. In the cytosol, glycogen breakdown or glycogenolysis is carried out by two enzymes, glycogen phosphorylase which releases glucose 1 -phosphate from the linear chains of glycogen, and glycogen debranching enzyme which untangles the branch points. In the lysosomes, glycogen degradation is catalyzed by α-glucosidase.

Glucose-H 2 /glucose-D 2 kinetic isotope effects of ∼ 2 (at 373 K) for intramolecular C 2 –C 1 hydride shift isomerization to fructose indicate that glucose transport to active sites within Ti-Beta-F or Ti-Beta-OH does not limit turnover rates in liquid water or methanol, {{in spite of}} dramatic differences in the volumetric occupation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic void spaces by physisorbed solvent molecules. <b>Glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> turnover rates (per total Ti; 373 K) in liquid water are first-order in aqueous glucose concentration (at least up to 1. 5 % (w/w)). The mechanistic interpretation of measured first-order isomerization rate constants indicates that they reflect free energies of kinetically relevant isomerization transition states relative to two bound solvent molecules, which adsorb competitively with sugars at Lewis acid sites and are the most abundant surface intermediates during steady-state catalysis. The lower isomerization rate constants on Ti centers in highly defective environments, in part, reflect stronger coordination of solvent molecules to Ti centers via additional hydrogen bonding interactions with proximal surface hydroxyl groups. The direct measurement of <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> rate constants in the liquid phase provides a rigorous and quantitative description of the catalytic differences prevalent among Lewis acidic silica-based solids with hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties, and their interpretation using a mechanism-based rate equation provides further clarity into the inhibition of catalytic turnovers at Lewis acid sites by solvent coordination...|$|E
40|$|Chabazite (CHA) {{molecular}} sieves, {{which are}} industrial catalysts for the selective reduction of nitrogen oxides and {{the conversion of}} methanol into olefins, are also ideal materials in catalysis research because their crystalline frameworks contain one unique tetrahedral-site. The presence of a single lattice site allows for more accurate descriptions of experimental data using theoretical models, and consequently for more precise structure-function relationships of active sites incorporated into framework positions. A direct hydrothermal synthesis route to prepare pure-silica chabazite molecular sieves substituted with framework Sn atoms (Sn-CHA) is developed, which is required to predominantly incorporate Sn within the crystalline lattice. Quantitative titra-tion with Lewis bases (NH 3, CD 3 CN, pyridine) demonstrates that framework Sn atoms behave as Lewis acid sites, which catalyze intermolecular propionaldehyde reduction and ethanol oxidation, as well as glucose-fructose isomerization. Aqueous-phase <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> turnover rates on Sn-CHA are four orders-of-magnitude lower than on Sn-Beta zeolites, but similar to those on amorphous Sn-silicates. Further analysis of Sn-CHA by dynamic nuclear polarization enhanced solid-state nuclear magnetic reso-nance (DNP NMR) spectroscopy enables measurement of 119 Sn NMR chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) of Sn sites. Comparison of experimentally determined CSA parameters to those computed on cluster models using density functional theory supports the pres-ence of closed sites (Sn-(OSi) 4) and defect sites ((HO) -Sn-(OSi) 3) adjacent to a framework Si vacancy), which respectively be-come hydrated hydrolyzed-open sites and defect sites when Sn-CHA is exposed to ambient conditions or aqueous solution.

To probe structure/activity relationships in the zeolite, tin-containing silsesquioxanes with (1 a) and without (1 b) a neighboring SiOH group were recently synthesized and tested. These molecular catalysts are active for glucose conversion, and the presence (absence) of the SiOH favors fructose (mannose) selectivity by intramolecular H(C) -shift reactions.

Tungstite is a promising catalyst for the dehydration of glucose to HMF. Compared with Nb 2 O 5, fewer by-products are formed because of the low BrOnsted acidity of the (mixed) oxides.

On the other hand, postsynthetically synthesized Sn-beta samples prepared in two steps via dealumination and subsequent solid-state ion exchange from Al-beta show significantly lower activity, which is associated with a hydrophilic framework and/or a lower accessibility and different lattice position of the Sn sites in the zeolite crystal. Further, we provide a method to distinguish between different Sn sites on the basis of NMR cartography using chemical shift and chemical shift anisotropy as readily measurable parameters. This cartography allows identifying not only the nature of the active sites (closed, defect-open, and hydrolyzed-open) but also their position within the BEA framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> to fructose catalyzed by Lewis acidic Sn {{sites in the}} framework of MOR, BEA, MFI and MWW zeolites was investigated by periodic DFT calculations. The main focus was on the influence {{of the nature of the}} active site and the zeolite topology on the rate-controlling hydride shift step. A general finding is that the Sn-catalyzed isomerization of glucose is strongly promoted by proximate hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl groups can derive from co-adsorbed water molecules or internal silanols. The cooperative action of such proton donors with the Lewis acidic Sn sites results in more effective compensation of the negative charge developing on the O 1 atom of glucose during the rate-controlling hydride shift reaction step. The variation in the shape of the micropores with a zeolite topology affects the mode and strength of carbohydrate adsorption, which is dominated by van der Waals forces. Their influence on the intrinsic reactivity of intrazeolite Sn sites is small. We propose that higher glucose adsorption energy in the narrower micropores of 10 -membered ring zeolites (e. g., Sn-MFI and Sn-MWW) adversely affects the intrachannel diffusion compared to that in the zeolites with larger pores. The high catalytic performance of Sn-MWW towards glucose transformation is due to the lower barrier for the hydride shift step resulting from the presence of a relatively strong acidic bridging silanol group next to the Lewis acidic Sn site...|$|E
40|$|The {{isomerization}} of D-glucose to D-fructose, {{using the}} immobilized glucose isomerase enzyme, {{as a typical}} example of solid-liquid catalyzed reactions, {{has been carried out}} in a two impinging streams cyclone reactor (TISCR). The re-sults obtained for the conversion of glucose in TISCR were much higher than those expected in conventional reactors. This indicates the greater performance capability of TISCR relative to those of classical reaction systems. A compart-ment model was devised to describe the pattern of flow within the reactor. Considering such a flow pattern, a stochastic model for the residence time distribution (RTD) of solid particles was developed, using Markov chains discrete formu-lation. The latter was correlated with the experimental RTD data, obtained applying tracer analysis method. In addition, a model was devised for the rate of <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> in TISCR. The data predicted from the model was lower than those determined experimentally. One explanation for such an observation is that the overall rate of this reaction carried out under conventional conditions is not governed only by the intrinsic rate of reaction. In other words, the overall rate may be affected by both internal and external mass transfer resistances. In this case, the rate constants account for both mass transfer and kinetic effects. In the two impinging streams systems the diffusion resistance of the liquid film sur-rounding the solid particles is low because of the high velocity of the particles. Moreover, the energy released and dissipated as the result of strong collision of particles may also contribute to total energy of the reacting system and thus enhances the rate of reaction...|$|E
40|$|Monosaccharide and {{disaccharide}} isomerization and epimerization {{reactions are}} catalyzed by Lewis acidic sites (M = Sn, Ti, Zr) isolated in silica-based heterogeneous solids, with selectivity and stereochem. specificity that are inaccessible to sugar rearrangements involving enolate intermediates catalyzed by bases. Such selectivity and specificity reflect {{the ability of}} electrophilic Lewis acid centers to coordinate with oxygenated sugar functional groups and to subsequently mediate intramol. rearrangements of specific H and C atoms, the mechanistic details of which are probed using D and ^(13) C isotopically-labeled reactants. Here, we discuss recent progress in understanding the influence of: (i) heteroatom and solvent identity on active site structures and reaction mechanisms and (ii) the surrounding silicate environments on the turnover rates of sugar reactions. For example, <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> to fructose is mediated by Lewis acidic Ti sites isolated within hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments provided by cryst. mol. sieves with the Beta topol. and by amorphous silica. Measured first-order rate consts. (per total Ti atom; 373 K), detd. from batch reactor studies under conditions of strict kinetic control, are {{an order of magnitude}} higher in liq. water for hydrophobic than for hydrophilic solids. Mechanistic interpretation of these rate consts. indicates that the environments surrounding Ti centers influence free energy differences between isomerization transition states and two bound solvent mols. that adsorb competitively at Lewis sites and are most abundant surface intermediates during catalysis. Similar roles of hydrophobic pockets confining Lewis centers are found in heterogeneous, homogeneous and enzymic active sites that mediate sugar reactions. These findings help clarify the mechanistic details and site requirements for sugar conversion on heterogeneous Lewis acid solids, and also provide guidance for active site structural modification to promote desired reaction pathways and thus to develop new heterogeneous catalysts for selective sugar conversion in liq. media...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns associated with diminishing reserves {{of fossil fuels}} has led to accelerated research efforts towards the discovery of new catalytic processes for converting renewable lignocellulosic biomass into value-added chemicals. For this conversion, nanoporous solid acid materials {{have been widely used}} because of their excellent hydrothermal stability and molecular sieving capability. In the thesis, hierarchical Lewis acid zeolites with ordered mesoporosity and MFI topology (three dimensionally ordered mesoporous imprinted (3 DOm-i) Sn-MFI) were successfully synthesized within the confined space of three dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3 DOm) carbon by a seeded growth method. The obtained 3 DOm-i Sn-MFI showed at least 3 times higher catalytic activities for the biomass-derived sugar isomerization than conventional Sn-MFI zeolites. This is because the mesopores in the hierarchical zeolites greatly enhance molecular transport. In addition, Lewis acid Sn-MFI combined with Pt metal nanoparticles (Pt/Sn-MFI) could oxidize glycerol to produce lactic acid (LA) under base-free conditions. Glycerol is a by-product in biodiesel synthesis. 80. 5 % selectivity of LA was achieved at 89. 8 % conversion of glycerol using a bifunctional Pt/Sn-MFI catalyst under base-free conditions. In the tandem reaction pathway, selective oxidation of glycerol to glyceraldehyde (GLA) and dihydroxyacetone (DHA) by using Pt catalysts was cascaded with Lewis acid catalyzed isomerization of GLA/DHA into LA. Moreover, morphology-tunable Lewis acid Sn-BEA with hydrophobicity was successfully synthesized by recrystallization of post-synthesized Sn-BEA (Sn-BEA-PS) using ammonium fluoride (NH 4 F) and tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr). This recrystallization includes simultaneous procedures of dissolution-reassembly: i) the dissolution of Si-O bonds around silanol nests by fluoride ions, and ii) the reassembly of fragmented silica species into defect-free zeolite framework in the presence of TEA ions. The recrystallization also increased open Lewis acid Sn sites. These findings can explain why a 2. 5 times higher rate of aqueous <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> was achieved on recrystallized Sn-BEA (Sn-BEA-RC), compared with Sn-BEA-PS. Moreover, in the isomerization of bulky lactose (C 12 sugar) dissolved in MeOH, hierarchical Sn-BEA-RC showed a 3. 2 -fold higher activity than hydrothermally synthesized Sn-BEA (Sn-BEA-HF), due to the mesopores and enhanced organophobic character of the recrystallized catalyst. In the final part, renewable p-xylene synthesis was investigated. p-Xylene is a major commodity chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with applications in polyester fibers, films and bottles. Diels-Alder cycloaddition of 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF) and ethylene with subsequent dehydration of the cycloadduct intermediate to produce p-xylene is an attractive reaction pathway for its production from biomass feedstocks. It was shown that phosphorous-containing zeolite BEA (P-BEA) is active, stable and selective for this reaction with an unprecedented p-xylene yield of 97 %. It can selectively catalyze the dehydration reaction from the furan-ethylene cycloadduct to p-xylene, without performing side reactions which include alkylation and oligomerization. This acid catalyst establishes a commercially attractive process for renewable p-xylene production...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} as a {{resource}} to produce value-added products has garnered significant interest {{as a means of}} reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This task is complicated by the complex, highly functionalized nature of abundant biomass derivatives, such as glucose. Tin-containing zeolite Beta (Sn-Beta) has been investigated as a catalyst for isomerizing aldohexoses into ketohexoses through a Lewis acid mediated hydride shift (1, 2 -intramolecular hydride shift, 1, 2 -HS). Recent studies on the reactivities of Lewis base-doped and alkali-exchanged Sn-Beta samples have conclusively demonstrated that the open tin site performs the <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> reaction. With Lewis base doped Sn-Beta, glucose conversion is almost completely eliminated and product selectivity is shifted predominantly to mannose, formed through a 1, 2 -intramolecular carbon shift (1, 2 -CS). To understand the structure-activity relationships between the conditions of the active sites in the zeolite, three molecular models (tin silsesquioxanes) of the tin sites in the zeolite are synthesized. Two tin silsesquioxanes that contain an octahedral tin site with and without an adjacent silanol group are prepared and used as catalysts for the reaction of glucose. The catalyst that contains the adjacent silanol group selectively forms fructose through a 1, 2 -HS while the catalyst without the silanol group yields mannose through a 1, 2 -CS. These results provide further evidence for the nature of the active sites in Sn-Beta. A methyl-ligated tin silsesquioxane is experimentally and theoretically examined to examine possible reactivities at the closed site. This compound is an active glucose conversion catalyst that selectively produces mannose, although the rates of reaction are far below those obtained from Sn-Beta. Additionally, a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics model is constructed, and the complete catalytic cycle is computationally examined via considering ring-opening, three distinct pathways for each hydride- and carbon-shift reaction, and ring-closing. The combined experimental and computational results suggest that there could be reaction pathways that involve Si-O-Sn cleavage that give much slower reaction rates than the open tin site in Sn-Beta. Zeolite and zeolite-like molecular sieves are being used in a large number of applications such as adsorption and catalysis. Achievement of the long-standing goal of creating a chiral, polycrystalline molecular sieve with bulk enantioenrichment would enable these materials to perform enantioselective functions. In part II of this thesis, the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched samples of a molecular sieve is reported. Enantiopure organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) are designed with the assistance of computational methods, and used to synthesize enantioenriched, polycrystalline molecular sieve samples of either enantiomer. Computational results correctly predicted which enantiomer is obtained, and enantiomeric enrichment is proven by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The enantioenriched and racemic samples of the molecular sieves are tested as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts. The enantioenriched molecular sieves show enantioselectivity for the ring opening reaction of epoxides and enantioselective adsorption of 2 -butanol (R enantiomer of the molecular sieve shows opposite and approximately equal enantioselectivity from the S enantiomer of the molecular sieve, while the racemic sample of the molecular sieve shows no enantioselectivity). ...|$|E
40|$|The deconstruction and {{upgrading}} of lignocellulosic biomass {{dissolved in}} ionic liquids was studied {{as a potential}} alternative route to products traditionally synthesized from petroleum. While domestic biomass is a cheaper, lower carbon emission, alternative feedstock to petroleum, its utilization requires the selective deconstruction of the biopolymer to monomeric sugars and upgrading of the sugars to higher value products. Since biomass is soluble in ionic liquids, there {{is the opportunity to}} do both the deconstruction and secondary upgrading using "one-pot" homogeneous catalysis. 	The primary focus of this work was to understand the kinetics of both biomass deconstruction and secondary sugar chemistry in ionic liquids. Biomass is a complex collection of molecules that consists of three primary components, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Since cellulose is the primary component, accounting for roughly 45 wt% of the raw biomass on a dry basis, initial studies aimed to understand the hydrolysis of dissolved cellulose to its sugar residue glucose. Using microcrystalline Avicel cellulose as a model, the rate laws and activation energies of cellulose hydrolysis and glucose dehydration were determined in the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]). No evidence of oligosaccharides was observed, suggesting that hydrolysis occurs preferentially at chain ends and is irreversible. Gradually adding water to the reaction solution, so as not to precipitate cellulose but also limit the secondary dehydration of the resulting glucose to 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (5 -HMF), significantly increased glucose yield and limited production of degradation products (humins). Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the effects of water, and possible routes to humin formation. 	While understanding the reactivity of model compounds is important to the development of biomass conversion technologies, it is critical to understand how the components of biomass react in their native form. An investigation was carried out to compare the reactivity of cellulose and hemicellulose model compounds to both pretreated and miscanthus grass in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim][Cl]). Activation energies of model compounds were compared with the native component in raw biomass. Significant rate decreases in hydrolysis of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic components in raw biomass compared to Avicel and Xylan from Birchwood were attributed to the interaction of lignin with the biopolymers in raw biomass. However, reaction of two pretreated substrates with varying degrees of delignification showed that the presence of lignin did not have a detrimental effect on hydrolysis, but instead suggested that breaking the raw biomass macrostructures is the key to improving hydrolysis of the biopolymers. Gradual water addition strategies further improved saccharine yield, but left the cellulosic component incompletely hydrolyzed. This unhydrolyzed cellulosic component could be further converted by varying the temperature, acid concentration, or performing a second hydrolysis on the reactor residue. 	After demonstrating the ability to generate sugars in high yield from miscanthus, we investigated the selective conversion of glucose to 5 -HMF in ionic liquids using metal chlorides. Chromium chloride, CrCl 2, has been proposed to isomerize glucose to fructose, which is readily dehydrated to 5 -HMF in imidazolium chloride ionic liquids without an added catalyst. We began by studying the kinetics of fructose dehydration in [Emim][Cl] and investigating the effects of CrCl 2 on the dehydration to 5 -HMF. Then the kinetics of <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerization</b> to fructose using CrCl 2 were characterized and compared to the rate and activation energy for fructose dehydration. Using the data for fructose, a model for the kinetics of fructose dehydration and isomerization in the presence of CrCl 2 was developed. When the model was applied to glucose, it failed to describe the large conversion of glucose and small yields of 5 -HMF in the initial reaction period. The accuracy of the model could be improved by including an intermediate in the glucose to fructose dehydration, which highlighted the need to characterize intermediates and products formed during dehydration using more detailed spectroscopic techniques than chromatography. 	Finally, we conducted in-situ 13 C NMR experiments to characterize the intermediates and products formed and to understand the effect of the ionic liquid solvent on glucose dehydration to 5 -HMF catalyzed by metal chlorides in [Emim][Cl]. Compared to H 2 O, glucose dissolved in [Emim][Cl] exhibited higher equilibrium concentrations of the furanose and acyclic isomers of glucose. These isomers were observed to undergo dehydration more rapidly than the pyranose isomers of glucose. The rate of anomerization was also found to be faster in [Emim][Cl], a process that may facilitate ring opening in several proposed mechanisms for glucose dehydration. In situ catalytic studies were conducted using WCl 6, which concluded that fructose is not formed as the reactive intermediate, but rather glucose first undergoes partial dehydration, before it is transformed from its unreactive aldose form to the more reactive ketose form. Using these observations, combined with studies of glucose dehydration catalyzed by H 2 SO 4 several mechanisms were proposed to explain the progressive dehydration of glucose to 5 -HMF using metal chlorides...|$|E
