5000|$|In 2010, {{a refined}} <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> called 21HAC was reported. 21HAC {{is based on}} a {{stripped}} copy of human chromosome 21, producing a chromosome 5 Mb in length. Truncation of chromosome 21 resulted in a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> that is mitotically stable. 21HAC was also able to be transferred into cells from a variety of species (mice, chickens, humans). Using 21HAC, researchers were able to insert a herpes simplex virus- thymidine kinase coding gene into tumor cells. This [...] "suicide gene" [...] is required to activate many antiviral medications.

50|$|There are {{currently}} two accepted {{models for the}} creation of <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> vectors. The first is to create a small minichromosome by altering a natural human chromosome. This is accomplished by truncating the natural chromosome, followed by the introduction of unique genetic material via the Cre-Lox system of recombination. The second method involves the literal creation of a novel chromosome de novo. Progress regarding de novo HAC formation has been limited, as many large genomic fragments will not successfully integrate into de novo vectors. Another factor limiting de novo vector formation is limited knowledge of what elements are required for construction, specifically centromeric sequences.|$|E

The reprogramming of patients' somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, combined with technologies for correcting the genetic defect, possesses great potential for the development of new treatments for genetic diseases. In this study, we obtained human cardiomyocytes from DMD patient–derived, induced pluripotent stem cells genetically corrected with a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> carrying the whole dystrophin genomic sequence. Stimulation by cytokines was combined with cell culturing on hydrogel with physiological stiffness, allowing an adhesion-dependent maturation and a proper dystrophin expression.

The underlying sequence did not correlate with chromatin states, because both higher-order α-satellite DNA and noncentromeric DNA were enriched for modifications that define CEN chromatin, euchromatin, and heterochromatin. <b>Human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were also organized into distinct domains. CENP-A and heterochromatin were assembled over noncentromeric DNA, including the gene blasticidin, into nonoverlapping domains. Blasticidin transcripts were enriched at sites of CENP-A binding but not at H 3 methylated at lysine 9, indicating that formation of CEN chromatin within a repetitive DNA environment does not preclude gene expression. Finally, we tested the role of centric heterochromatin as a centromeric boundary by increasing CENP-A dosage to expand the CEN domain. In response, H 3 lysine 9 dimethylation, but not trimethylation, was markedly decreased at all centromeres examined.

The disruption of kinetochore structure by KAP 1 subdomains does not simply result from loss of centromeric CENP-A nucleosomes. Instead it reflects a hierarchical disruption of the outer kinetochore, with CENP-C levels falling before CENP-A levels and, in certain instances, CENP-H being lost more readily than CENP-C.

The first theme was to develop a novel <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> in mouse embryonic stem cells. The second theme was to understand the factors affecting chromosome stability which may also affect the efficiency of <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> formation. so that our protocol for better HAC preparation can be refined. There are six results chapters in my thesis. The first three chapters described how I developed <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in mouse embryonic stem cells. Initially, vectors containing a long stretch of human alphoid DNA were delivered to mouse cells using the Herpes Simplex Virus-I (HSV-l) amplicon system but the efficiency was low. Next, mouse pericentromeric and centromeric DNAs were employed for mouse <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (MAC) via HSV-l system. However, the efficiency remained the same. Finally, I used the Microcell-Mediated Chromosome Transfer (MMCT) system to transfer HAC from HTl 080 cells into mouse ES cells and successfully established HAC in ES which were highly stable. The results obtained in this first part of my thesis suggested that to increase HAC formation efficiency it would be necessary to improve the techniques of HSV-I delivery and MMCT. Moreover, it would also be important to better characterize factors affecting chromosome behaviour. The last three results chapters focus on factors affecting chromosomes stability and improving the HSV - 1 delivery system and MMCT. I undertook an in vivo study of whole cell fusion experiments with the aid of live cell irnaging system, and found that histone H 2 B proteins underwent a dynamic assembly/disassembly processes. Live cell imaging of MMCT suggested that the microcell delivery is a very slow process and the results may lead to a refinement of the MMCT protocol. I found it is possible to generate a single HAC using two HSV-l amplicons containing two different constructs, potentially doubling the HSV-l HAC capacity from 150 kb to 300 kb. The last chapter illustrated how the expression of non- coding centromeric satellites impaired chromosome stability in both human cultured and human embryonic stem cells.
