Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E

40|$|Provides current {{evidence}} about opportunities <b>for</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> become home owners. Executive summary There has been considerable media exposure {{in recent years}} to the contracting opportunities <b>for</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> become home owners, just as there was {{at the turn of the}} millennium. Rising dwelling prices were a problem then as they are now. The language of crisis often flavours such writing, with commentary linking the problematic housing future of the young with the more favourable environment faced by their parents, the baby boomers. This short report is designed to provide current evidence around the topic, with the particular research objectives of identifying: 1. The degree to which younger households, particularly the cohorts aged 25 – 44 years, have experienced a contraction in home purchase over the last 30 years. 2. The adaptive responses this generation has made to circumvent obstacles to ownership, particularly that of declining housing affordability. 3. Which younger households have been most disadvantaged in terms of home purchase opportunity—and whether factors such as income and household type, have been influential in this regard. This paper is a quantitative study and relies for its findings on 30 years of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data, most notably from the census.  ...|$|R

Asep Saefudin, writing for Antara, himself a graduate from Muhammadiyah schools, viewed the film as being well put together and reflective of the issues faced by Islamic modernists in the early 1900s. Pramono praised the film's acting, soundtrack, and plot, especially Dahlan's portrayal as a human with emotions and flaws instead of being perfect in every way. He found Sang Pencerah greatest weakness to be the language spoken by in some scenes, as it mixed Indonesian with Javanese (something not done during the period portrayed), and the film's stars– neither of whom is Javanese– had inaccurate accents.|$|E
