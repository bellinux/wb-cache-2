40|$|It is {{well-known}} that musicians {{are at risk}} for music-induced hearing loss, however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory system are still difficult to assess. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine if college students in jazz band-based <b>instructional</b> <b>activity</b> are exposed to loud classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based <b>instructional</b> <b>activity</b> (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music students (n = 11) participating in a 50 -min regular classroom activity (control), and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based <b>instructional</b> <b>activity</b> ranged from 95 dBA to 105. 8 dBA with a mean of 99. 5 ± 2. 5 dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46. 4 dBA to 67. 4 dBA with a mean of 49. 9 ± 10. 6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P < 0. 05), and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emission response in both ears (P < 0. 05) after exposure to the jazz ensemble-based <b>instructional</b> <b>activity.</b> No significant changes were found in the control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts...|$|R

This paper reports on the first stage of the design of software to assist educators in ensuring assessment questions meet educational outcomes. A review of the literature within the field of instructional psychology was undertaken with a view towards establishing a theoretical foundation for the design of an autonomous system to classify instructional statements according to learning complexity. This review focussed on taxonomies of learning outcomes commonly used by educators and instructional designers to design and deliver instructional content within the cognitive domain. An <b>Instructional</b> <b>Activity</b> Matrix was synthesised from this review to provide an informed basis for the autonomous classification of instructional statements according to the nouns and verbs used to describe the types of knowledge and cognitive processes to be elicited.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we discuss the role of {{observation}} in learning to write. We argue that the acquisition of skill in such a complex domain as writing relies on observation, the classical imitatio. An important phase in learning to write, at all ages, is learning to write by observing and evaluating relevant processes: writing processes, reading processes or communication processes between writers and readers. First, we present two practical cases: writing lessons in which observation and inquiry are amongst other key elements and where students participate {{in a community of}} learners. Then, we review research that may inspire and substantiate proposals for implementing observation as a learning activity in writing education. Two types of studies are discussed: studies in which learners acquire strategies by observing and evaluating writing and reading processes of peers, as a prewriting <b>instructional</b> <b>activity,</b> and studies in which learners are stimulated to “pre-test ” and then revise their first draft, as a post writing <b>instructional</b> <b>activity.</b> The paper closes with some recommendations for further research...|$|R
