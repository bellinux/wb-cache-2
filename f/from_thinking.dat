When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted Michael Wallis, a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film. In 2001, the movie's working title was Route 66 (after U.S. Route 66), but in 2002, the title was changed to prevent people <b>from</b> <b>thinking</b> it was related to the 1960 television show with the same name. In addition, Lightning McQueen's number was originally going to be 57 (Lasseter's birth year), but was changed to 95 (the year Toy Story was released).|$|E

25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people <b>from</b> <b>thinking</b> politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

500|$|Biographer John Watson {{notes that}} Innis's work was profoundly {{political}} while McLuhan's was not. He writes that [...] "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, {{is the key}} to Innis's work. This also underlies the politicization of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." [...] Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. [...] "For Innis, the yellow press of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men <b>from</b> <b>thinking</b> beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." [...] Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the [...] "dialectic of power and knowledge" [...] in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.|$|E

500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics {{has three}} key aims, and, correspondingly, its {{chapters}} are split into three sections. These aims are {{the analysis of}} three key [...] "innovations" [...] that the editors identify in the book's introduction. The first {{of these is the}} move, in animal ethics, <b>from</b> <b>thinking</b> about personal change to thinking about the implementation of rules or norms of conduct at the societal level. The second of these is a possible rapprochement between animal ethics and ecologism (environmental ethics and green political theory). The third is the increased presence of animal protection laws for the benefit of nonhuman animals themselves. Aside from the introduction, the book features ten single-authored chapters, with three in Part I: The Politicization of the Animal Advocacy Discourse, three in Part II: The Rapprochement between Animal Ethics and Ecologism, and four in Part III: The Introduction of Laws and Institutions for the Benefit of Animals.|$|E

500|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Yukito Kunisaki, the protagonist of Air. He lives a poor life going {{from town to town}} with little money, {{trying to make a living}} off his show with a puppet. By being an {{adolescent}} or young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and does his best to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of Air, makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase gao when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs, finding the story of their glory and extinction [...] "romantic". As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed <b>from</b> <b>thinking</b> chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it is ridiculous.|$|E

500|$|Although filmed {{to create}} the {{illusion}} that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a [...] "surreptitious cut" [...] helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the cop car is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of the series required 800 to 1,200 film cuts, but [...] "X-Cops" [...] only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the X-Files logo to appear {{at any time during the}} episode. He stressed that he wanted [...] "X-Cops" [...] to feel like an [...] "episode of Cops that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." [...] The network, fearing that people would not understand that [...] "X-Cops" [...] was actually an episode of The X-Files, vetoed this idea. A compromise was reached wherein the episode would open with the Cops theme song, but the normal X-Files credits would scroll after an opening scene. In addition, the commercial bumpers would feature red and blue lights flashing across The X-Files logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion to the Cops logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of The X-Files to prevent watchers <b>from</b> <b>thinking</b> that the show [...] "has been preempted this week by Cops".|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Meditation {{has a long}} tradition with substantial implications for many psychotherapies. It has been postulated that meditation may cultivate therapeutic processes similar to various psychotherapies. A previous study used joint factor analysis to identify five common factors of items of scales purported to capture psychological states cultivated by medi-tation, focusing, and cognitive behavioral therapy, namely, refraining <b>from</b> catastrophic <b>thinking,</b> logical objectivity, self-observation, acceptance, and detached coping. The pres-ent study aimed to extend previous research on these five factors by examining their longitudinal relationship to symp-toms of depression, obsession and compulsion, and worrying, with two correlational surveys without intervention. Potential mediators of their effect on worrying were also explored. Longitudinal questionnaire studies from two student samples (n= 157 and 232, respectively) found that (a) detached coping was inversely related to obsessive-compulsive symptoms about 5 weeks later; (b) detached coping was inversely related to depressive symptoms about 5 weeks later; (c) refraining <b>from</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> was inversely related to worrying, while self-observation was positively related to worrying about 2 months later; and (d) the relation of refraining <b>from</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> to worrying was mediated by negative beliefs about worrying, while the relation of self-observation to worrying was mediated by negative beliefs about worrying and monitoring of one’s cognitive processes. As refraining <b>from</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> involves being detached <b>from</b> one’s negative <b>thinking</b> and detached coping involves distancing oneself from external circumstances and problems, the results suggest that distancing attitudes are useful for long-term reduction of various psychological symptoms...|$|R
