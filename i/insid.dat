40|$|Abstract: We study {{dynamics}} of Type IIB bound-state of a Dirichlet string and n fundamental strings {{in the background}} of N fundamental strings. Because of supergravity potential, the bound-state string is pulled to the background fundamental strings, whose motion is described by open string rolling radion field. The string coupling can be made controllably weak and, in the limit 1 ≪ g 2 stn ≪ g 2 stN, the bound-state energy involved is small compared to the string scale. We thus propose rolling {{dynamics of}} open string radion in this system as an exactly solvable analog for rolling dynamics of open string tachyon in decaying D-brane. The dynamics bears a novel feature that the worldsheet electric field increases monotonically to the critical value as the bound-state string falls into the background string.

40|$|Abstract: We study {{roles of}} quark-quark {{correlations}} in the baryons for the deep inelastic structure function and the ∆I = 1 / 2 {{rule of the}} non-leptonic weak hyperon decay. The quark-quark correlation is incorporated phenomenologically as diquarks within the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model. The strong diquark correlations in the spin- 0 channel enhance the ∆I = 1 / 2 weak matrix elements, and account for the ∆I = 1 / 2 rule. The ratio of the nucleon structure functions F n p 2 (x) /F 2 (x) also comes to agree with experiment due to the diquark correlations. 1 Introduction − quark-quark correlations inside the nucleon Recently models of the baryons have attracted considerable interest. These models, e. g.

40|$|We draw {{attention}} on the fast oscillatory deviations from the residual non-ambipolarity in the case where electrons are driven by strong magnetic perturbations. If the turbulent diffusion of the electrons and ions are different one can expect that a radial electric field develops (such that the ambipolarity is reinstored) and that poloidal plasma spin-up can occur. However {{it has been shown}} that the diffusion of particles in turbulent fields is ambipolar. In Ref. [1] the difference in the radial fluxes generated by fluctuating fields has been considered and the rôle of the ion polarization drift has been underlined. The radial ion flux partially cancels the radial electron flux and the ambipolarity is reestablished approximately, to the order 1 /ε⊥, which is a very small quantity (ε ⊥ is the plasma transversal permitivity constant). The problem has been examined in detail for instabilities having a substantial magnetic component in Ref. [2]. When the unstable modes that drive the radial transport are bounded <b>insid...</b>|$|E

Screens were attached to the lateral windows of the greenhouse to repel whiteflies that approached the nets. To electrostatically guard the greenhouse entrance, doubly charged dipolar electric field screens (DD-screens) were used to capture whiteflies entering through the door. The ICWs, oppositely charged with equal voltages, were arrayed one after the other, and an insulator board or net was placed on one side of the ICW-layer.

40|$|Natural gas is an {{important}} source of primary energy that, under normal production conditions, is saturated with water vapor. Water vapor in a natural gas stream can result in line plugging due to hydrate formation, reduction of line capacity due to collection of free water in the line, and increased risk of damage to the pipeline due to the corrosive effects of water. Therefore, water vapor must be removed from natural gas to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion from condensed water. Gas dehydration is the process of removing water vapor from a gas stream to lower the temperature at which water will condense from the stream; this temperature is called the ‘‘dew point’ ’ of the gas. There are several methods of dehydrating natural gas. The most common of these IJSER are liquid desiccant (glycol) dehydration, solid desiccant dehydration, and refrigeration. Molecular sieves are considered {{as one of the most}} important materials that are used as solid desiccant materials in industrial natural gas dehydration.
