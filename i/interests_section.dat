25|$|USINT Havana and its counterpart, the <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> of the Republic of Cuba in Washington, were {{formally}} {{sections of}} the respective Embassies of Switzerland, although they operated independently of the Swiss in virtually all but protocol respects. During this period, the United States and Cuba did not operate embassies in each other's countries, and their respective Interests Sections functioned as de facto embassies.The last Section Chief of USINT Havana was Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who served from August 2014 to its termination in 2015. He subsequently became Chargé d'affaires of the embassy.|$|E
25|$|The initial American {{staffing}} of the Section {{consisted of}} ten State Department Officials and a plain clothes US Marine guard detachment. By mutual agreement, the Cubans had {{an equal number}} of staff in Washington. Lyle Franklin Lane was the first Chief of the <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> in Havana. When they re-entered the building, they found items dating from the 1950s, including Eisenhower's photograph. Wayne Smith, who had closed the Embassy in 1961 as a young officer, replaced Lane in September 1979 when the entire US staff turned over after an initial two-year tour of duty.|$|E

It was staffed by United States Foreign Service personnel and local staff {{employed by the}} US Department of State, and located in a multi-story office building on the Malecón across from the Plaza de la Revolución in Havana.

25|$|In early 1979, as {{more and}} more Cubans were {{authorized}} to leave the country, and could not find countries, including the United States, that would admit them, the internal situation became increasingly unstable, eventually leading to the Mariel Boatlift in April 1980. The US government had led the Cuban government to believe that it would take most of the former political prisoners and their families it authorized to depart. However, {{it was not possible to}} fulfill this commitment. A large band of ex political prisoners with permission to leave and no place to go made daily rounds of the Embassies of Venezuela and Spain, as well as the US <b>Interests</b> <b>Section,</b> in search of visas. The Cuban government told the <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> it suspected that the US was attempting to destabilize the internal order of the country by using these desperate dissidents to fuel further popular discontent and warned that if immediate action to document these Cubans for emigration was not forthcoming, they would take matters into their own hands. They had done so before during the Johnson Administration when they opened the port of Camarioca to vessels from Miami picking up the relatives who wanted to leave. In that case the crisis was disarmed with the establishment of a formal orderly program to screen applicants and airlift the emigrants to the US. This program was terminated by the Nixon Administration leaving several thousand applicants unattended.|$|E
25|$|US and Cuban Interests Sections {{staffed by}} actual US and Cuban diplomats were {{mutually}} agreed upon in 1977 after the Carter Administration took office {{and decided to}} seek normalization of relations with Cuba. US officials replaced the Swiss diplomats in the US <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> in Havana on September 1, 1977. Both under the Swiss and later with US staff, the Section occupied the former United States Embassy building on Havana's Malecon that was designed by Harrison & Abramovitz architects and originally entered into service in 1953. When relations were broken in 1961, the building was occupied, and its contents safeguarded, by the Swiss diplomats who handled US interests in Cuba {{on behalf of the}} US Government as the protecting power until the arrival of the US staff in 1977.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} two years of resumed US presence, only one US {{passenger}} aircraft was hijacked to Cuba from the US. President Castro went personally to the airport to manage the June 12, 1979, hijacking incident involving Delta Air Lines flight 1061, a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar piloted by Captain Vince Doda. It had been hijacked by Eduardo Guerra Jimenez, a former Cuban air force pilot who had hijacked a MiG jet to the United States 10 years earlier. Castro personally met with and briefed the US Consular Officer, Tom Holladay, who had been sent to the scene. Through Holladay, Castro assured the US Government that Cuba would adhere to the terms of the bilateral anti-hijacking agreement even though it was in suspension due to disagreements over US handling of Cuban boatjackers. When asked, Castro also authorized the passengers to purchase items from airport shops with hard currency. The aircraft and passengers returned to the US without delay or incident. Because it could not accept the Captain's Company credit cards, Cuba extended Delta credit for the refueling with Holladay's assurance that Delta was good for its money and the <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> would facilitate the payment from Delta via the Department of State OCS Trust mechanism. Delta transferred the funds immediately.|$|E

25|$|Spurred by {{a burgeoning}} {{interest}} in the assumed untapped product demand in Cuba, {{a growing number of}} free-marketers in Congress, backed by Western and Great Plains lawmakers who represent agribusiness, have tried each year since 2000 to water down or lift regulations preventing Americans from traveling to Cuba. Four times over that time period the United States House of Representatives has adopted language lifting the travel ban, and in 2003 the U.S. Senate followed suit for the first time. Each time President George W. Bush threatened to veto the bill. Faced with a veto threat, each year Congress dropped its attempt to lift the travel ban before sending legislation to the president. Some United States nationals circumvent the ban by traveling to Cuba from a different country (such as Mexico, The Bahamas, Canada or Costa Rica), as Cuban immigration authorities do not routinely stamp passports, but instead stamp a Cuban visa page which is provided, and not permanently affixed to the passport. In doing so, however, U.S. citizens still risk prosecution and fines by the U.S. government if discovered. Until July 20, 2015 there was no U.S. Embassy or consulate in Cuba and United States representation was limited to a United States <b>Interests</b> <b>Section.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the Mariel Boatlift was {{partially}} a Cuban response to Western failure {{to take the}} dissident unadapted prisoners and ex prisoners out of Cuba, it was sparked by {{the removal of the}} Cuban security guards from the Embassy of Peru compound resulting in its being overrun by thousands of Cuban asylum seekers. Leaving the country was again in vogue as the US-Cuban relationship improved. Cuban members of divided families were encouraged to seek exit permission. For those for whom legal channels were not available, since early 1979, increasing numbers of Cubans had tried to gain access to Foreign Embassies in Havana to gain asylum and safe passage abroad. Large groups entered diplomatic compounds by jumping from adjacent buildings and by ramming gates and perimeter fences with buses and trucks. In such an attempt at the Embassy of Peru, a Cuban guard was killed by friendly fire. Cuba precipitously removed the perimeter guards and over ten thousand Cuban asylum seekers flooded the compound. Eventually 125,000 Cubans left the island in the ensuing months, mostly to the United States. Also during the Mariel period a large group of hundreds of Cuban ex-political prisoners and applicants to immigrate to the United States to rejoin family (civilians) waiting in front of the <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> was attacked by government employees in several buses and sought refuge inside the building. A junior Consular Officer, Susan Johnson, was accused of inciting the crowd on national TV and in Granma. The USG withdrew her to the Cuban desk in Washington (and she was expelled from Cuba as persona non grata). The Cubans had been secretly filming Consular crowd dispersal activities at the front entrance and used the film as evidence of incitement, but did not include the audio portion which would have shown that there was no incitement.|$|E

500|$|Under Castro's leadership, Cuba {{became one}} of the best-educated and healthiest {{societies}} in the Third World as well {{as one of the most}} militarised states in Latin America. Despite its small size and limited economic weight, Castro's Cuba gained a large role in world affairs. On the island, the Castro government's legitimacy rested on the improvements that it brought to social justice, healthcare, and education. The administration also relied heavily on its appeals to nationalistic sentiment, in particular the widespread hostility to the U.S. government. According to Balfour, Castro's domestic popularity stemmed from the fact that he symbolised [...] "a long-cherished hope of national liberation and social justice" [...] for much of the population. Balfour also noted that throughout Latin America, Castro served as [...] "a symbol of defiance against the continued economic and cultural imperialism of the United States". Similarly, Wayne S. Smith—the former Chief of the United States <b>Interests</b> <b>Section</b> in Havana—noted that Castro's opposition to U.S. dominance and transformation of Cuba into a significant world player resulted in him receiving [...] "warm applause" [...] throughout the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
