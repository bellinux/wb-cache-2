5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight <b>irradiance,</b> depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface <b>irradiance,</b> extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E
40|$|Pupillary light reflex (PLR) is an {{important}} clinical tool to assess the integrity of visual pathways. The available evidence suggests that melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) mediate PLR-driven by the classical photoreceptors (rods and cones) at low <b>irradiances</b> and by melanopsin activation at high <b>irradiances.</b> However, genetic or pharmacological elimination of melanopsin does not completely abolish PLR at high <b>irradiances,</b> raising the possibility that classical photoreceptors may have a role even at high <b>irradiances.</b> Using an inducible mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration, we asked whether classical photoreceptors are responsible for PLR at all <b>irradiances,</b> {{and found that the}} PLR was severely attenuated at all <b>irradiances.</b> Using multiple approaches, we show that the residual PLR at high <b>irradiances</b> in this mouse was primarily from the remnant rods and cones, with a minor contribution from melanopsin activation. In contrast, in rd 1 mouse where classical photoreceptor degeneration occurs during development, the PLR was absent at low <b>irradiances</b> but intact at high <b>irradiances,</b> as reported previously. Since mRGCs receive inputs from classical photoreceptors, we also asked whether developmental loss of classical photoreceptors as in rd 1 mouse leads to compensatory takeover of the high-irradiance PLR by mRGCs. Specifically, we looked at a distinct subpopulation of mRGCs that express Brn 3 b transcription factor, which has been shown to mediate PLR. We found that rd 1 mouse had a significantly higher proportion of Brn 3 b-expressing M 1 type of mRGCs than in the inducible model. Interestingly, inducing classical photoreceptor degeneration during development also resulted in a higher proportion of Brn 3 b-expressing M 1 cells and partially rescued PLR at high <b>irradiances.</b> These results suggest that classical photoreceptors are primarily responsible for PLR at all <b>irradiances,</b> while melanopsin activation makes a minor contribution at very high <b>irradiances...</b>|$|R

In particular, there is major disagreement on the magnitude of the variability of the spectral <b>irradiances</b> over the solar cycle. The effects of different solar features on the ultraviolet spectral <b>irradiances</b> over both the 28 day solar rotation period and over the solar cycle are discussed. It is proposed that any attempt to predict the magnitudes of the ultraviolet spectral <b>irradiances</b> must take into account a long term variability of emission from quiet regions of the solar disk over the solar cycle.

40|$|Background/Purpose: This {{paper has}} {{considered}} the erythemal UV (UVery), UVA and visible <b>irradiances</b> {{in the shade}} of Australian trees for each season at a sub-tropical southern hemisphere site. Methods: The <b>irradiances</b> in tree shade have been measured with radiometers {{as a percentage of the}} <b>irradiances</b> in the sun for each season of the year. Results: Although the solar <b>irradiances</b> are lower in winter, the percentages of the UV in tree shade compared to the UV in full sun are marginally higher (by up to 7 %) in the winter compared to summer. The range of percentages for UVery was up to double that of the percentages of the visible waveband. The percentages for UVery were also higher than for the UVA waveband. The percentages of the <b>irradiances</b> in the tree shade compared to full sun are 8 - 14 % lower at noon compared to the morning and afternoon for the UVery waveband. The ratio of UVA to UVery is lower in the tree shade compared to the full sun. Conclusions: The UVA to UVery ratio is expected to be even lower in the tree shade as a result of ozone depletion. This, combined with the visible <b>irradiances</b> in the tree shade not being a reliable indication of the biologically damaging UV <b>irradiances,</b> has consequences for public health and skin cancer prevention...|$|R

5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct <b>irradiance</b> and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

The spectral shade ratio calculated as the ratio of the spectral biologically effective <b>irradiances</b> in the shade to those in the adjacent sun decreased with increasing wavelength for all of the trees. The decrease in the shade ratio was approximately 42 % at 400 nm compared to the shade ratio at 300 nm.

25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level <b>irradiance</b> found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an <b>irradiance</b> of 0.2 μW/cm².

25|$|Surface albedo {{is defined}} as the ratio of <b>irradiance</b> {{reflected}} to the <b>irradiance</b> received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see Position of the Sun). While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly or annual averages.|$|E

25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the <b>irradiance</b> (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV <b>irradiance,</b> or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E
