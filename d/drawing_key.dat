5|$|To {{improve the}} quality of the music, Disney hired the {{professional}} composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion the Silly Symphony series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the Nine Old Men. Both the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of <b>drawing</b> <b>key</b> poses and letting lower-paid assistants sketch the in-between poses. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close. Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overworkso he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.|$|E

The research focuses on local perceptions of biodiversity loss and land degradation in grazing pastures as a result of anthropogenic activities. We show that land degradation can be motivated by climate change, while local overuse of indigenous vegetation can lead to resource conflict. We then examine how changes in indigenous vegetation might influence the livelihood and security of local communities. In <b>drawing</b> <b>key</b> findings common to all three countries, we suggest that the sustainability of indigenous vegetation in dryland ecosystems can be maintained through seasonal mobility of herds, preservation of dry season grazing and improved livestock marketing, and that failure to do so can result in far-reaching consequences for rural communities...|$|E

Special focus is on {{issues related to the}} management of the parent organisation and its evolution during the whole life cycle of the project. The problems and their tentative and normative solutions are described within the framework of CERN's new Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project, although the presented approach should be applicable to any organisation with similar characteristics. Traditionally, a project organisation is temporarily mantled to accomplish the defined objectives, not affecting the main functions of the parent organisation. Yet it is argued that also the parent organisation should be seen to be under continuous transformation processes. By studying the status of the on-going projects and the associated resources the parent organisation is encouraged to adapt a mode where rigid organisational positions are based on skills with evolving work content. The managerial principles of a process organisation must take into account the resources and their skills, along with their career development. The pape...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{partnership}} has imposed itself {{within the past}} few years in international relations and international political economy.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{explores the}} {{experience}} of conducting clinical research on adult nurses' attitudes towards individuals with a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) {{from the perspective of}} an undergraduate mental health nursing student. The original intention of this paper was to use a grounded theory research approach to explore the attitudes that currently exist amongst adult nurses towards those with AN. A qualitative questionnaire was developed for use as the research instrument for this research project, and four adult ward settings chosen for study, based upon their relevance to the physical symptoms of AN and consequent likelihood to provide care for those with a diagnosis of AN. However, as the research journey progressed, a number of difficulties were encountered and negotiation of access to adult settings and the recruitment of participants proved to be major hindrances in the data collection process. This necessitated a shift in the focus of the paper towards an exploration of the researcher's experience in attempting to conduct the study. This paper provides a discussion of these challenges {{in the context of the}} current nursing environment, using relevant literature to provide an informed critique of the issues. It concludes by <b>drawing</b> <b>key</b> implications from this discussion. The first implication is that of the personal development that this project has facilitated, and the second is that of recommendations that have been indicated for individuals intending to conduct mental health research in non-mental health settings...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new stabilised low-order finite element {{methodology}} for large strain fast dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - The numerical technique describing the motion is formulated upon the mixed set of first-order hyperbolic conservation laws already presented by Lee et al. (2013) where the main variables are the linear momentum, the deformation gradient tensor and the total energy. The mixed formulation is discretised using the standard explicit two-step Taylor-Galerkin (2 TG) approach, which has been successfully employed in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Unfortunately, the results display non-physical spurious (or hourglassing) modes, leading to the breakdown of the numerical scheme. For this reason, the 2 TG methodology is further improved by means of two ingredients, namely a curl-free projection of the deformation gradient tensor and the inclusion of an additional stiffness stabilisation term. Findings - A series of numerical examples are carried out <b>drawing</b> <b>key</b> comparisons between the proposed formulation and some other recently published numerical techniques. Originality/value - Both velocities (or displacements) and stresses display the same rate of convergence, which proves ideal in the case of industrial applications where low-order discretisations tend to be preferred. The enhancements introduced in this paper enable the use of linear triangular (or bilinear quadrilateral) elements in two dimensional nearly incompressible dynamics applications without locking difficulties. In addition, an artificial viscosity term has been added into the formulation to eliminate the appearance of spurious oscillations in the vicinity of sharp spatial gradients induced by shocks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0264 - 4401...|$|E

This qualitative study in Uganda examined children’s awareness of and access to timely, quality healthcare {{as part of a}} broader study examining whether institutions established for children in Africa are raising awareness about children’s rights amongst children and engaging with children in decision-making and planning. To establish whether children possessed knowledge of their rights and could inform decisions at a community level. Using action research approaches, the team conducted focus group discussions (FGD), <b>drawing,</b> <b>key</b> informant interviews(KII), dialogue meetings (DM), and observations in one village in a rural and another in aperi-urban district, with 72 participants (21 children aged 10 – 15 and 51 adult stakeholders at community, district and national levels). Children were aware of their right to quality health services. In FGDs and drawing, children described their dissatisfaction with and difficulties in accessing healthcare services. These were confirmed with the adult stakeholders in the KIIs and DMs, the DMs also including children who presented their FGD results to community stakeholders. The findings suggested a lack of clear guidelines in schools or health facilities to support children needing medical attention. There was limited stakeholder capacity to involve children meaningfully in programme plans and decisions directly affecting them. Recommendations included the development of explicit policies with specific strong linkages between educational, health and other service institutions to promote, protect and respect children’s rights and also training to elicit children’s perspectives in decisions that affect them. </p...|$|E

40|$|Constant {{increase}} in water demand, scarcity of resources, insufficient public finance, and the country's geographical position {{in one of}} the most and regions of the world have combined to create considerable problems in the provision of water to Saudi Arabia. This is in addition to the enormous and rapid {{increase in}} population growth, which is the main driver of demand and which was accompanied in the past by an increase in urbanisation, placing the country among the most highly urbanised countries. These conditions have instigated new patterns of demand that undermine the principle of sustainability. The high per capita consumption of water coupled with the low tariff levied by the government all represents a challenge for efficient management of water services around the country. As water provision in Saudi Arabia relies greatly upon government financing, any reduction of spending on the sector by the government is likely to mean shortage of supply and under-provision of services. The objective of this study is to increase the understanding of how the initial course of action might be explored, when seeking reform in order to promote private sector investment in the process of water services delivery. This entails potential, practicable reforms in the operation of the urban water system so as to put forward a model for such participation by the private sector, showing alternative long-term policies and institutional frameworks for the water industry and <b>drawing</b> <b>key</b> inferences concerning a new structure that will most benefit the country. Saudi Arabia is the case study, and its capital city Arriyadh is used as an example to show the impact of rapid growth upon water resources and services, and the associated implications. Basically, the case study is an intensive strategy used to access detailed knowledge in certain areas of science. To achieve the aims and objectives of this research, and to address its issues and questions a combination of primary and secondary procedures were employed to obtain the required knowledge, collection, analysis and interpretation of data. These include a literature survey, analysis of relevant documents, and focused interviews, as the objective was related to existing circumstances with a view to proposing new policies. This study finds that in the light of existing conditions, water demand will continue to increase due to projected population growth. This must mean the growing importance of seawater desalination in the future. Meeting demand with desalinated water entails new and significant expansion for the industry, and this will require vast investments which the government might not be able to provide. Given that, private sector involvement appears to offer a viable option for developing and running large-scale projects for water production. This study also indicates the importance of synchronised fundamental changes, with such participation including water tariff restructuring and effective control of network leakage, among others. Not surprisingly such changes in the water sector are both possible and expected, given the trend for this and other governments to increase the private sector's contribution to economic activities. The study offers a range of guiding principles that should be considered in line with the prospective changes in the country's water services. Finally, recommendations are made to support policy-makers in reaching appropriate decisions with respect to this vital resource, together with the intention of achieving greater sustainability in water development and management programmes.
