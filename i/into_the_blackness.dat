25|$|By midnight, Lookout Mountain was quiet. Pettus and Holtzclaw {{received}} orders at 2 a.m. {{to march}} off the mountain. Postwar writings of both Union and Confederate veterans {{refer to a}} brilliant moon, which slipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of a total lunar eclipse, screening the Confederate withdrawal. That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight {{it out on the}} strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E
500|$|Firefly is an American space Western drama {{television}} series created by {{writer and director}} Joss Whedon, under his Mutant Enemy Productions label. Whedon served as an executive producer, along with Tim Minear. [...] The series {{is set in the}} year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a [...] "Firefly-class" [...] spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon pitched the show as [...] "nine people looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of space and seeing nine different things".|$|E
60|$|I peered hard <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness,</b> {{but could}} {{distinguish}} nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Arabs, no doubt," [...] muttered Almayer to himself, peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> solid <b>blackness.</b> [...] "What {{are they}} up to now? Some of Abdulla's business; curse him!" ...|$|R
60|$|But, alas, they came. We {{heard them}} {{coming down the}} trench, and I bade Mary hide in a corner, lest she be {{discovered}} and punished. There was naught else she could do, and so she crawled away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Stygian <b>blackness</b> behind me.|$|R
60|$|Even {{after the}} beast had left, Clayton dared not descend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> awful <b>blackness</b> beneath him, {{and so he}} spent a terrifying and hideous night in the tree. The next morning he {{returned}} to the beach, relinquishing the last hope of succoring Jane Porter.|$|R
60|$|With maniacal {{laughter}} Smoke {{flung it}} all out on the hardening snow-crust and went back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness.</b>|$|E
60|$|I peered keenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness.</b> At length I {{reached the}} slope. Here I dropped to {{my hands and}} knees.|$|E
60|$|A {{minute later}} {{they had left}} me, and I stood {{watching}} them until the two stars of light from their lanterns vanished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness.</b>|$|E
60|$|The friends {{glanced back}} involuntarily over their {{shoulders}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dense <b>blackness</b> of <b>the</b> forest. At one point a single broad shaft of light slid down between two pines and cast a golden blotch upon their track. Save for this one vivid spot all was sombre and silent.|$|R
60|$|His little fire of greasewood threw a wan circle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} <b>blackness.</b> Not a sound hinted of life. He {{longed for}} even the bark of a coyote. Silvermane stooped motionless with tired head. Wolf stretched limply on the sand. Hare rolled into his blanket and stretched out with slow aching relief.|$|R
60|$|Archie {{had been}} looking out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ancient <b>blackness,</b> pierced here and there with a rayless star; taking the sweet air of the moors and <b>the</b> night <b>into</b> his bosom deeply; seeking, perhaps finding, peace after {{the manner of the}} unhappy. He turned round as she came in, and showed her a pale face against the window-frame.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look to the window!" [...] cried Peter of Blentz, {{and then}} Barney Custer let go his hold upon the sill and dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> below.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} is young, very young, only a girl," [...] replied {{the captain of the}} Minerva, {{continuing}} to stare <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> that hid the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew! supposing {{he drove}} over that!" [...] shuddered Andy, {{as he pointed}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of the hollow. [...] "That must be a hundred feet or more deep." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2.6 [...] "Distressed," [...] (March 7, 2008): Ghosts migrate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> zone of <b>blackness</b> around <b>the</b> {{house at}} the end of the universe. Travis has an unwelcome visitor from his past.|$|R
60|$|That {{her little}} Tarzan could destroy a great bull gorilla she {{knew to be}} improbable, and so, as she neared the spot from which {{the sounds of the}} {{struggle}} had come, she moved more warily and at last slowly and with extreme caution she traversed the lowest branches, peering eagerly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> moon-splashed <b>blackness</b> for a sign of the combatants.|$|R
60|$|The {{balance of}} the night the apes sat huddled close to one another for warmth; while Mugambi built a fire close to them over which he crouched. Tarzan and Sheeta, however, were of a {{different}} mind, for neither of them feared the jungle night, and the insistent craving of their hunger sent them off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Stygian <b>blackness</b> of <b>the</b> forest in search of prey.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} his arm, and Lilian {{wondered}} a little at his composure as she laid her hand on it and they passed together <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of the firs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Tad, are y'u heah?" [...] {{she called}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness.</b> She heard the mice scamper and rustle and she smelled the musty, old, woody odor of a long-unused cabin.|$|E
60|$|This little {{incident}} was not unpleasant to the captain. If the negroes {{were afraid to}} go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of the caves, it would make fewer complications in this matter.|$|E
60|$|The beat of paddles slackened a little, {{there was}} a murmur of voices beneath the steamer's side, and Jefferson leaned out, looking down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> impenetrable <b>blackness</b> beneath him. A {{scraping}} sound came out of it, and apparently moved along, while, when the half-seen man thrust a big block of coal upon him, Austin turned and strode softly after Jefferson, who walked forward beside the rail.|$|R
60|$|The dim {{gloom of}} the woods soon darkened <b>into</b> <b>blackness.</b> <b>The</b> flashes of lightning, {{momentarily}} streaking the foliage, or sweeping overhead in pale yellow sheets, aided Jonathan in keeping the trail.|$|R
60|$|The {{basement}} floor had several doors, as is usual {{in such a}} house; doors that would naturally lead to the kitchen, the scullery, the pantry, the servants' hall, and so on. Rupert flung open all the doors with indescribable rapidity. Four out of the five opened on entirely empty apartments. The fifth was locked. Rupert broke the door in like a bandbox, and we fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sudden <b>blackness</b> of <b>the</b> sealed, unlighted room.|$|R
60|$|Numabo {{was unable}} to rally the now {{thoroughly}} terrified and painfully burned warriors so that rescued and rescuers passed out of the village <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of the jungle without further interference.|$|E
60|$|Already the {{soldiers}} were at the window. At {{the sound of his}} voice they tore aside the draperies; at the same instant the pseudo-king turned and leaped out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of the night.|$|E
60|$|And <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of {{the forest}} we plunged, I {{claiming}} to be better versed, in woodcraft than my companion, yet doing that which the most ignorant townsman would never have dreamed of attempting.|$|E
60|$|So {{they marched}} {{back to their}} camp of the {{previous}} night, and, lighting great fires, ate and recounted the adventures of the day until long after dark. Tarzan slept until midnight, then he arose and crept <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Cimmerian <b>blackness</b> of <b>the</b> forest. An hour later {{he came to the}} edge of the clearing before the village. There was a camp-fire burning within the palisade. The ape-man crept across the clearing until he stood before the barred gates. Through the interstices he saw a lone sentry sitting before the fire.|$|R
60|$|Not a soul in the streets; not a {{light in}} a window. He left the little town behind, passed the last {{isolated}} house on the road, and walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> greater <b>blackness</b> of a road between tall hedges. He had put on canvas shoes with rubber soles, for the better surprise of Mr. Farrer, and his own progress seemed to partake of a ghostly nature. Every ghost story he had ever heard or read crowded into his memory. For {{the first time in}} his experience even the idea of the company of Mr. Farrer seemed better than no company at all.|$|R
6000|$|Wherefore, on the whole, we will honour a Paper Age too; an Era of hope! For in {{this same}} frightful process of Enceladus Revolt; when the task, on which no mortal would willingly enter, has become imperative, inevitable,--is it not even a {{kindness}} of Nature that she lures us forward by cheerful promises, fallacious or not; and a whole generation plunges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Erebus <b>Blackness,</b> lighted on by an Era of Hope? It has been well said: 'Man is based on Hope; he has properly no other possession but Hope; this habitation of his is named the Place of Hope.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Lorna came {{slowly up}} stairs to enter her room, moving quietly. And Lane {{lay on his}} bed, wide-eyed, staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness.</b> [...] "My little sister," [...] he whispered to himself. And the words that had meant so much seemed a mockery.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned away}} and walked with exaggerated {{carelessness}} {{in the direction of}} the door. He even went outside and peeped through the crack, but the sleepers did not stir. He glanced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> behind, and then came hastily into the room again.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{there came}} an interruption. Some one was {{approaching}} the hut. Sheeta gave a low growl and slunk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of a far corner. Evidently the visitor {{did not hear}} the warning sound, for almost immediately he entered the hut--a tall, naked, savage warrior.|$|E
60|$|On {{they went}} for some distance, admiring the ice pinnacles, leaning over crevasses, and peering down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> depths where {{the deep blue}} of the ice walls shaded off <b>into</b> <b>blackness.</b> <b>The</b> guides went ahead, {{sounding}} carefully the snow before them for a few inches, the first precursor of coming change, had fallen two days before. Suddenly one of the guides uttered an exclamation.|$|R
60|$|At {{least it}} seemed to Owen that {{presently}} once again he was gazing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dense intolerable <b>blackness</b> of <b>the</b> night. Then a marvel came to pass, for <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> opened, or rather on it, framed and surrounded by it, there appeared a vision. It was {{the vision of a}} native town, having a great bare space in the centre of it encircled by hundreds or thousands of huts. But there was no one stirring about the huts, for it was night--not this his night of trial indeed, since now the sky was strewn with innumerable stars. Everything was silent about that town, save that now and again a dog barked or a fretful child wailed within a hut, or the sentries as they passed saluted each other {{in the name of the}} king.|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Jacob Burckhardt, in that able {{work of his}} {{to which}} {{reference}} already has been made, follows the well-worn path of unrestrained invective against the Borgias, giving to the usual empty assertions the place which should be assigned to evidence and argument. Like his predecessors along that path, he causes Giuliano della Rovere to shine heroically by contrast--a foil to throw <b>into</b> greater relief <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> of Alexander. But he carries assertion rather further than do others when he says of Cardinal della Rovere that [...] "He ascended the steps of St. Peter's Chair without simony and amid general applause, and with him ceased, at all events, the undisguised traffic in the highest offices of the Church." ...|$|R
