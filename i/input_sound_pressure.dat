40|$|The {{auditory}} system transduces sound-evoked vibrations over a {{range of}} <b>input</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels spanning six orders of magnitude. An {{important component of the}} system mediating this impressive dynamic range is established in the cochlear sensory epithelium, where functional subtypes of cochlear nerve fibers differ in threshold sensitivity, and spontaneous discharge rate (SR), by more than a factor of 1000 (Liberman, 1978), even though, regardless of type, each fiber contacts only a single hair cell via a single ribbon synapse. To study the mechanisms underlying this remarkable heterogeneity in threshold sensitivity among the 5 – 30 primary sensory fibers innervating a single inner hair cell, we quantified the sizes of presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic AMPA receptor patches in > 1200 synapses, using high-power confocal imaging of mouse cochleas immunostained for CtBP 2 (C-terminal binding protein 2, a major ribbon protein) and GluR 2 / 3 (glutamate receptors 2 and 3). We document complementary gradients, most striking in mid-cochlear regions, whereby synapses from the modiolar face and/or basal pole of the inner hair cell have larger ribbons and smaller receptor patches than synapses located in opposite regions of the cell. The AMPA receptor expression gradient likely contributes to the differences in cochlear nerve threshold and SR seen on {{the two sides of the}} hair cell in vivo (Liberman, 1982 a); the differences in ribbon size may contribute to the heterogeneity of EPSC waveforms seen in vitro (Grant et al., 2010).

40|$|Bone {{conduction}} is {{the process}} by which an acoustic signal vibrates the skull bones to stimulate the cochlea. Patients with pure conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and single sided deafness are sometimes poorly rehabilitated by conventional air conduction hearing aids due to for example the functionality losses in the middle ear. With these hearing impairments, the cochlea may function perfectly and a bone conduction hearing device can transmit the sound signal more efficiently to the cochlea. Today, the percutaneous bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is an important alternative for such individuals. This device uses a percutaneous snap coupling together with a bone anchored implant to transmit the sound vibrations to the skull bone and has proven to offer very good hearing rehabilitation. However, such a system with permanent skin penetration requires a life-long commitment of care every day, may cause skin infections, and there is a risk for implant damage due to trauma and hence improvements are called for in these aspects. A novel bone conduction implant (BCI) device is designed {{as an alternative to the}} percutaneous BAHA device, because it leaves the skin intact. The BCI device provides a specific hearing aid digital signal processor, and analog signal processing parts. By applying amplitude modulation technique, the sound signal is transmitted to a permanently implanted transducer via an inductive link system through the intact skin. An efficient wireless power and data transmission system for the BCI device has been designed and implemented. Maximum power output (MPO) of the BCI was designed to occur at 4 mm skin thickness. The power output variability for 1 to 8 mm skin thickness variations was within 1. 5 dB. Maximum MPO was found to be 109 dB relative to 1 μN at transducer resonance frequency. This implant system consumes 14. 6 mA of battery current at 1 kHz at 65 dB <b>input</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level.

40|$|A rich body of vibroacoustic {{test data}} was {{recently}} generated at Marshall Space Flight Center for a curved orthogrid panel typical of launch vehicle skin structures. Several test article configurations were produced by adding component equipment of differing weights to the flight-like vehicle panel. The test data {{were used to}} anchor computational predictions {{of a variety of}} spatially distributed responses including acceleration, strain and component interface force. Transfer functions relating the responses to the input pressure field were generated from finite element based modal solutions and test-derived damping estimates. A diffuse acoustic field model was employed to describe the assumed correlation of phased <b>input</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressures</b> across the energized panel. This application demonstrates the ability to quickly and accurately predict a variety of responses to acoustically energized skin panels with mounted components. Favorable comparisons between the measured and predicted responses were established. The validated models were used to examine vibration response sensitivities to relevant modeling parameters such as pressure patch density, mesh density, weight of the mounted component and model form. Convergence metrics include spectral densities and cumulative root-mean squared (RMS) functions for acceleration, velocity, displacement, strain and interface force. Minimum frequencies for response convergence were established as well as recommendations for modeling techniques, particularly {{in the early stages of}} a component design when accurate structural vibration requirements are needed relatively quickly. The results were compared with long-established guidelines for modeling accuracy of component-loaded panels. A theoretical basis for the Response/Pressure Transfer Function (RPTF) approach provides insight into trends observed in the response predictions and confirmed in the test data. The software modules developed for the RPTF method can be easily adapted for quick replacement of the diffuse acoustic field with other pressure field models; for example a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) model suitable for vehicle ascent. Wind tunnel tests have been proposed to anchor the predictions and provide new insight into modeling approaches for this type of environment. Finally, component vibration environments for design were developed from the measured and predicted responses and compared with those derived from traditional techniques such as Barrett scaling methods for unloaded and component-loaded panels...|$|R

40|$|The Bone Conduction Implant (BCI) {{system has}} been {{developed}} {{as an alternative to}} the percutaneous bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) with the advantage that the skin is kept intact. The transducer is permanently implanted and attached to the skull via a flat surface contact to the temporal bone. By applying amplitude modulation, the sound signal is transmitted to the implanted transducer through the intact skin via an efficient wireless inductive link. The external audio processor includes digital and analog signal processing units, and an Application Specific Integrated Circuit driving the inductive link. Its retention is provided by permanent magnets. Preclinical investigations of the BCI system have been performed on a skull simulator, a dry skull, cadaver heads and in an animal model study. In an extensive technical evaluation using a skull simulator, it was found that the power output from the BCI system was very robust for skin flap thicknesses from 2 to 8 mm with variability of less than 1. 5 dB. Moreover, the peak of the maximum power output was 107 dB relative to 1 μN at transducer resonance frequency and at 5 mm skin flap thickness. This means that the highest output forces were produced in the "normal" skin thickness range, which in fact was one important design goal. The BCI system drains approximately 7. 5 mA of battery current at 1 kHz and at 65 dB <b>input</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, which corresponds to a battery lifetime of 5 - 7 days under normal use. It was found that significantly higher gain setting can be used without feedback problems for the BCI as compared to the BAHA. In an animal model (sheep), it was found that the implant-to-bone attachment became firmer over time and that the vibration transmission was stable over this period of eight months. Finally, in a clinical study, the results of the first patient were reported at one month follow up. The surgical procedure for installing the implant was found to be easy and safe, and the BCI gave a significant improvement in hearing over the unaided condition. The functional power output of the BCI was similar to most powerful ear level BAHA devices on headband at lower frequencies and superior at higher frequencies. In summary, it was found that the new BCI system can be an attractive alternative to the present percutaneous BAHA system...|$|E

Generally, the mean values of the predicted attenuation are observed to track the mean values of the measured attenuation quite well and predicted confidence intervals tend to be larger in the presence of mean flow.
