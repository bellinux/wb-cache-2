5|$|The Russian {{unmanned}} resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to {{the station}} on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU <b>docking</b> <b>system.</b> Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 {{which resulted in the}} spacecraft colliding with Mir, causing significant damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{near-miss}} and collision incidents presented further safety issues. Both {{were caused}} by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual <b>docking</b> <b>system,</b> which was undergoing tests at the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove the expensive Kurs automatic <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> from the Progress ships.|$|E
5|$|On flight day 3, the STS-74 {{crew members}} {{successfully}} mated the 15-foot Russian built docking module with the shuttle's Orbiter <b>Docking</b> <b>System.</b> No problems were reported during the mating operation.|$|E

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter <b>Docking</b> <b>System.</b> At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter <b>Docking</b> <b>System</b> retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} {{accidents}} concerned {{testing of the}} station's TORU manual <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> to manually dock Progress M-33 and Progress M-34. The tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive Kurs automatic <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> from Progress spacecraft. Due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking Spektr and puncturing the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to Spektr being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard Mir as the module's solar arrays produced {{a large proportion of}} the station's electrical supply, causing the station to power down and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6 was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} manned Soyuz spacecraft, which carried out crew rotations and would also {{have been used in}} the event of an emergency evacuation. The ferries docked automatically to the station, making use of the new Igla automatic <b>docking</b> <b>system,</b> and were used by departing crews to return to Earth at the end of their flight.|$|E

50|$|The Great Western Railway {{had owned}} small <b>dock</b> <b>systems</b> but now found itself {{the owner of}} one of the two largest dock groups in the country. At first the GWR was {{uncertain}} of the possibility of a positive future for this sector, but using the skill and experience of the existing managers of the <b>dock</b> <b>systems</b> it achieved commercial success.|$|R
5|$|The {{crew members}} also {{checked out the}} Advanced Space Vision System, a precise {{alignment}} system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted {{of a series of}} large dots placed on the exterior of the docking module and the <b>docking</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The day's {{schedule}} {{also included}} the installation and {{alignment of the}} centerline camera in {{the centre of the}} Orbiter <b>Docking</b> <b>System.</b> The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as Atlantis moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00am CST (11:00UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000statute miles behind Mir, and was closing in to the space station {{at a rate of about}} 380statute miles per orbit.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's {{reaction}} control thrusters {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with Atlantiss Orbiter <b>Docking</b> <b>System</b> on flight day 2.|$|E
50|$|Langton Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, {{and part}} of the Port of Liverpool. It is {{situated}} in the northern <b>dock</b> <b>system</b> in Bootle, connected to Alexandra Dock to the north and Brocklebank Dock to the south.

5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.|$|E
5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur {{inspected}} the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of the docking module over to Atlantiss <b>docking</b> <b>system.</b> All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Endeavour docking, the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was undocked {{to make room for}} the space shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about a mile away from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 marked the {{beginning}} of the longest human presence in space, until 23 October 2010, when this record was surpassed by the ISS. It also {{marked the beginning}} of Mir's second expansion. The Kvant-2 and Kristall modules were now ready for launch. Alexander Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov docked with Mir and brought the station out of its five-month hibernation. On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> in preparation for the arrival of Kvant-2, the first of the 20tonne add-on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the Almaz programme.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-30 {{launched}} at 05:01:29 UT on April 4, 2000. Docking {{occurred on}} April 6 at 06:31:24 UT. Although the Soyuz <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> is automated under normal conditions, the final few meters {{of the approach}} to the station were executed in manual mode. The decision to switch to manual mode came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft's approach to the targeted docking port. At about 09:32 UT {{on the day of}} docking, the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work.|$|E

5|$|Foale's Increment {{proceeded}} fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship {{collided with}} solar arrays on the Spektr module {{during the second}} test of the Progress manual <b>docking</b> <b>system,</b> TORU. The module's outer shell was hit and holed, which caused the station to lose pressure. This was the first on-orbit depressurization {{in the history of}} spaceflight. The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed Spektr's hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and salvage and replanning effort by Foale and the science community minimized the loss of research data and capability.|$|E
5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E
5|$|The studies {{looked at}} {{minimizing}} required {{modifications to the}} Gemini spacecraft. Three docking methods were considered. The first was use of the existing <b>docking</b> <b>system</b> used on Gemini-Agena missions. This would have allowed the mission to be accomplished with little modification to the Gemini spacecraft needed, however crew transfer {{could only have been}} accomplished by means of an Extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Changes that would have been required included strengthening the nose, installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn, adding the necessary equipment to perform the transfer EVA, and providing provisions for flight to and from the station. The number of retro-rockets would have been increased from four to six. A second method would have seen the spacecraft dock in the same way, but after docking, the spacecraft would be swung round and attached {{to the side of the}} space station. A tunnel would then have been placed over the Gemini's hatches, allowing the crew to transfer to the station without performing an EVA. Some modifications to the hatches would have been required. The final proposed docking method was to use a port mounted on the rear of the equipment module, which would have allowed the crew to transfer directly between the spacecraft and space station, through the docking port.|$|E
