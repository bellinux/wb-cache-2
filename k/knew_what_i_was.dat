25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> selling.|$|E

500|$|The first issues Lowndes was {{responsible}} for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had over Hornig, vetoing {{five of the seven}} stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, and [...] didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E

[...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take down, I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to do with}} it later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he was such a great singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote longhand letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album {{and there were a}} couple of tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and explain why I wanted to use some of his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, he said I was free to do whatever because he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.|$|E

500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a bad mood of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E
500|$|Eddie Van Halen, lead guitarist of {{hard rock}} band Van Halen, {{was asked to}} add a guitar solo. When {{initially}} contacted by Jones, Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call. Having established that the call was genuine, Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge. [...] "I did it as a favor", the musician later said. [...] "I was a complete fool, according {{to the rest of}} the band, our manager and everyone else. I was not used. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing – I don't do something unless I want to do it." [...] Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist's house with a [...] "skeleton version" [...] of the song. Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled, [...] "Initially, we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo—but Quincy thought it was too tough. So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released." [...] The song was among the last four completed for Thriller; the others were [...] "Human Nature", [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" [...] and [...] "The Lady in My Life".|$|E
500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E

500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here to do", Strickland said.|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] When {{he had worked}} for Gernsback, Silberkleit had suggested [...] "Future Fiction" [...] as a possible title for the magazine Gernsback was planning to launch. [...] Gernsback eventually chose [...] "Amazing Stories" [...] instead, and Silberkleit now decided to use his original suggestion {{for one of the}} new magazines. [...] In November 1939 the first issue of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig received his military draft notice; he was a pacifist, and decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector. [...] He continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards [...] "I would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim heard of the offer and prompted Robert W. Lowndes to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that {{it might be a good}} idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. [...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E

Falwell, {{after being}} sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1983, over an {{offensive}} ad parody in Hustler {{that suggested that}} Falwell's first sexual encounter was with his mother in an out-house. Falwell sued Flynt, citing emotional distress caused by the ad. The decision clarified that public figures cannot recover damages for [...] "intentional infliction of emotional distress" [...] based on parodies. After Falwell's death, Flynt said despite their differences, he and Falwell had become friends over the years, adding, [...] "I always appreciated his sincerity even though I {{knew what he was}} selling and he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> selling." ...|$|E

Christopher would pay tribute to his father's contribution to the war: [...] "Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done."

2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking about, what I was thinking about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hussey {{joined the}} James Reyne Band {{and worked on}} Reyne's self-titled debut solo album (September 1987), co-writing six tracks with the artist.
