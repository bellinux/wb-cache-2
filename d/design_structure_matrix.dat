This method is developed {{through the application of}} the <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> <b>matrix</b> (DSM) and real options theory. The DSM method is utilized to develop an improved visibility estimate for non-hierarchic system architectures. A method is also proposed to account for different module sizes and system module level testing costs.

40|$|International audienceToday, {{industry}} is under constant pressure to increase competitiveness and resource-efficiency. One possibility {{to cope with}} these challenges is industrial symbiosis. Industrial symbiosis is based on substituting a new resource by an undervalued resource such as waste. Thereby, industrial symbiosis reduces waste and saves resources. One of the practical challenges in developing industrial symbioses is the identification of symbiosis opportunities. In particular, the question how " new resource – substitute " combinations can be identified {{has not yet been}} addressed in the literature. This paper presents a modeling approach for industrial symbioses in industrial parks, based on <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> <b>matrices</b> (DSM), which intends to support the identification of substitution opportunities.

40|$|Software {{modularization}} activities remain {{without the}} guidance of formal theories and models. According to Baldwin and Clark’s [1] design rule theory (DRT), modular architectures add value to system designs by creating options to improve the system by substituting or experimenting on individual modules. In this paper, we examine the design evolution of two software product platforms through the modeling lens of DRT and <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> <b>matrices</b> (DSMs). We show that DSM models and DRT precisely explain how realworld modularization activities in one case allowed for different rates of evolution in different software modules and in another case conferred distinct strategic advantages on a firm (by permitting substitution of an at-risk software module without substantial change {{to the rest of}} the system). Our results provide positive evidence that DSM and DRT can inform important aspects of large-scale software structure and evolution, having the potential to guide software architecture design activities. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} problem that {{existing}} software dependency extraction methods do not work on higher-level software artifacts, do not express decisions explicitly, and do not reveal implicit or indirect dependencies, our recent work explored the possibility of formally defining and automatically deriving a pairwise dependence relation from an augmented constraint networks (ACN) that models the assumption relation among design decisions. The current approach is difficult to scale, requiring constraint solving and solution enumeration. We observe that the assumption relation among design decisions for most software systems can be abstractly modeled using a special form of ACN. For these more restrictive, but highly representative models, we present an O(n 3) algorithm to derive the dependency relation without solving the constraints. We evaluate our approach by computing <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> <b>matrices</b> for existing ACNs that model multiple versions of heterogenous real software designs, often reducing the running time from hours to seconds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Axiomatic design (AD) is {{a popular}} {{creative}} design method, which provides a systematic and scientific basis for making design solutions. The AD method is concentrated on how to find suitable design parameters {{to meet the needs}} of functional requirements, while certain system interaction factors and constraints (such as physical connectivity) are not catered directly. As a structured modeling method, more recently the <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> <b>matrix</b> (DSM) model has been regarded as a good roadmap of system interactions. DSM is a good tool representing interactions among design objectives and facilitating analysis of these interactions. Based on the complementarities between AD and DSM, it is proposed to enhance the AD method with DSM. The underlying logic is transforming the AD’s design matrix into corresponding DSM for system interaction evaluation, thereby improving the feasibility of AD result. A design example of friction drive conveyor is given to illustrate the proposed design method. Key Words: axiomatic design, <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> <b>matrix,</b> design theory. 1...|$|E

For this purpose, several user experiments were conducted that aimed to answer this research question {{in the context of}} product models used, for example in engineering, but the results can be generalised to other applications.
