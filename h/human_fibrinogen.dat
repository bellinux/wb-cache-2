We used primers based on sequences conserved between lamprey and <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogens</b> and applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to cDNA preparations from various invertebrates. A fibrinogen-like sequence was identified in cDNA prepared from the soft tissues of a sea cucumber, parastichopus parvimensis. The PCR-prepared material was then used to clone two closely related mRNA sequences from a sea cucumber soft tissue cDNA library.

40|$|The {{biomedical}} application of nanotechnology {{has come into}} the spotlight, {{with the promise of}} ‘personalised’ therapeutics that couple early diagnosis with targeted therapeutic activity. Due to the rapid growth of the {{biomedical application}}s of nanoparticles, along with the lack of understanding concerning their interactions with biomolecules, there is a pressing need for the development of standard methods directed at investigating the effect of introducing these unique particles into the human body. The central aim of this research is to establish a platform directed at assessing the biological fate of pioneering therapeutic particulate agents, such as metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs). In particular, we proposed, that Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) technology may be employed to assess the composition of blood protein corona deposited on the therapeutic surface, and subsequently assess the biocompatibility of such particles. The proposed method of protein detection utilises the nanogram sensitivity of QCM-D technology to monitor highly specific antibody-antigen interactions. In particular those interactions which occur when probe antibodies are used to detect adsorbed blood proteins deposited on target particle-modified sensor surfaces. Protein detection analysis was directed toward identification of surface bound human serum albumin, complement factor C 3 c, and <b>human</b> plasma <b>fibrinogen.</b> Preliminary analysis of generic biomedical surfaces indicated human serum albumin demonstrates a higher binding affinity towards positively charged surfaces (i. e. cysteamine self-assembled monolayer), followed by hydrophobic surfaces. Detection of complement C 3 c, corresponded with literature, where lower levels were detected on negatively charged surfaces (i. e. mercapto undecanoic acid self-assembled monolayer), and higher levels of more hydrophobic surfaces (i. e. 11 -amino undecane thiol self-assembled monolayer). <b>Human</b> plasma <b>fibrinogen</b> was observed to favour hydrophilic over hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer surfaces, which was in accordance with literature. Application of the proposed protein detection method for biocompatibility analysis of target therapeutic molecules, namely metallophthalocyanines and acid functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes, demonstrated a dependence on modified-surface film characteristics, such as surface charge and topography with regards to human serum albumin and <b>human</b> plasma <b>fibrinogen</b> analysis representing new insights into their potential biomolecular interactions The highest levels of detected human serum albumin and complement C 3 c were detected on the GePcSmix-modified surfaces. AlPcSmix-modified surfaces analysis suggested the highest levels of <b>human</b> plasma <b>fibrinogen.</b> Two methods of acid functionalisation were employed, using both nitric and sulphuric acid, and pure nitric acid. A general increase in detected human serum albumin, corresponding with an increase in functionalisation time, was observed. Complement C 3 c detection suggested an increase in deposited complement C 3 c, with increasing functionalisation time, when assessing nitric acid functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and a decrease, with increasing functionalisation time, when assessing nitric and sulphuric acid functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Analysis of <b>human</b> plasma <b>fibrinogen</b> was inconclusive, as were cytotoxicity experiments utilising MCF- 7 cells in the presence of metallophthalocyanine complexes, raising simultaneously important considerations for their application and study.

40|$|Acutobin {{isolated}} from Deinagkistrodon acutus venom {{has been used}} to prevent or treat stroke in patients. This defibrinogenating serine protease is a 39 kDa glycoprotein containing terminal disialyl-capped N-glycans. After sialidase treatment, the enzyme showed similar catalytic activities toward chromogenic substrate, and cleaved the Aa chain of fibrinogen as efficiently as the native acutobin did. However, the level of fibrinogen degradation products in mice after i. p. -injection of desialylated-acutobin was significantly lower than the level after acutobin injection, suggesting that the disialyl moieties may improve or prolong the half-life of acutobin. Two recombinant enzymes with identical protein structures and similar amidolytic activities to those of native acutobin were expressed from HEK 293 T and SW 1353 cells and designated as HKATB and SWATB, respectively. Mass spectrometric profiling showed that their glycans differed from those of acutobin. In contrast to acutobin, HKATB cleaved not only the Aa chain but also the Bb and c chains of <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogens,</b> while SWATB showed a reduced a-fibrinogenase activity. Non-denaturing deglycosylation of these proteases by peptide N-glycosidase F significantly reduced their fibrinogenolytic activities and thermal stabilities.

Taken together, our results suggest that the conjugated glycans of acutobin are involved in its interaction with fibrinogen, and that the selection of cells optimally expressing efficient glycoforms an...|$|R

In a study, fibrins from different species are used to compare the effects on neurite growth of mouse spinal cord neurons.

40|$|Introduction Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) frequently {{involves the}} loss of tolerance to citrullinated antigens, which {{may play a role}} in pathogenicity. Citrullinated fibrinogen is commonly found in inflamed synovial tissue and is a frequent target of autoantibodies in RA patients. To obtain insight into the B-cell response to citrullinated fibrinogen in RA, its autoepitopes were systematically mapped using a new methodology. Methods <b>Human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> was citrullinated in vitro by peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD), subjected to proteolysis and the resulting peptides were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. The peptide composition of the citrullinated peptide-containing fractions was determined by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The recognition of these fractions by patient sera was subsequently analyzed by imaging surface plasmon resonance on microarrays. Results In total about two-thirds of the 81 arginines of <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> were found to be susceptible to citrullination by the human PAD 2, the human PAD 4 or the rabbit PAD 2 enzymes. Citrullination sites were found in all three polypeptide chains of fibrinogen, although the α-chain appeared to contain most of them. The analysis of 98 anti-citrullinated protein antibody-positive RA sera using the new methodology allowed the identification of three major citrullinated epitope regions in <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen,</b> two in the α- and one in the β-chain. Conclusions A comprehensive overview of citrullination sites in <b>human</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> was generated. The multiplex analysis of peptide fractions derived from a post-translationally modified protein, characterized by mass spectrometry, with patient sera provides a versatile system for mapping modified amino acid-containing epitopes.

In contrast to that, the proteins adsorb in a globular assembly on flat and long-wavelength rippled TiO 2, but no adsorbed proteins could be observed on TiO 2 with short ripple wavelengths due to a decrease of the adsorption energy caused by surface curvature.
