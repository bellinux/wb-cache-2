5|$|The film's {{score was}} written, co-produced and {{composed}} by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel. It marked his first {{work on a}} feature film, {{as well as his}} first collaboration with music producer Daniel Lanois. Parker first met Gabriel during the film's post-production, as he had been experimenting with his music, incorporating the percussive rhythms from the musician's solo albums into the film. Parker contacted Gabriel's manager, record producer <b>David</b> <b>Geffen,</b> who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be a slow process, as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace. While working on his fifth studio album So, Gabriel agreed to score Birdy after viewing a rough cut of the film.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed {{to learn from the}} trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community. Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.|$|E

25|$|David Lawrence Geffen (born February 21, 1943) is an American {{business}} magnate, producer, film studio executive, and philanthropist. Geffen created or co-created Asylum Records in 1970, Geffen Records in 1980, DGC Records in 1990, and DreamWorks SKG in 1994. His {{donations to}} the <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> School of Medicine at UCLA and other educational and research donations have widened his fame beyond the entertainment industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> formed DreamWorks SKG, {{a diversified}} {{entertainment}} company. DreamWorks Animation remains {{located in the}} city's Grand Central Business Centre on land formerly occupied by a helicopter landing base next to the old airfield (and next to KABC-TV). Thus, many American animators who worked on feature films in the 1990s and 2000s have spent large portions of their careers in Glendale working for Disney or DreamWorks.|$|E
25|$|The UCLA Health System {{operates}} the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, {{a hospital in}} Santa Monica and twelve primary care clinics throughout Los Angeles County.

25|$|<b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> persuaded Mel Brooks to {{turn his}} movie into a stage musical. When Brooks met with Jerry Herman to discuss their working together, Herman declined, telling Brooks that he should do the job himself, as {{he was a good}} songwriter. Brooks then asked Thomas Meehan to join him in writing the book for the stage. Brooks persuaded Mike Ockrent and his wife Susan Stroman to join the {{creative}} team as director and choreographer. After Ockrent's death in 1999, Stroman agreed to continue as both director and choreographer.|$|E
25|$|Designed by {{architect}} William Burnet Tuthill {{and built}} by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie in 1891, {{it is one}} of the most prestigious venues in the world for both classical music and popular music. Carnegie Hall has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments, and presents about 250 performances each season. It is also rented out to performing groups. The hall has not had a resident company since 1962, when the New York Philharmonic moved to Lincoln Center's Philharmonic Hall (renamed Avery Fisher Hall in 1973 and <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> Hall in 2015).|$|E
25|$|She {{would soon}} be working on her next album. It was to be another double album set. When <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> stopped by the studio for a preview, he was warned {{that it was a}} work in progress, but it was almost done. That was a mistake, because only a few tracks had been finished, and most of them were in demo phase. He heard enough to tell {{producers}} that it was not good enough; the project was canceled. It would be released years later in 1996, under the title I'm a Rainbow.|$|E
25|$|The band's first recordings, {{under the}} auspices of Geffen record label head <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> and Kalodner, were {{extremely}} popular with record buyers, yet considered disappointing by music critics and fans of traditional progressive rock, who found the music closer to radio-friendly album-oriented rock (AOR). However, Asia clicked with fans of popular arena acts such as Journey, Boston and Styx; Kalodner had once introduced Wetton to Journey's short-lived frontman Robert Fleischman, with a view to Fleischman becoming Asia's lead-singer. As they worked on material together, Fleischman was impressed by Wetton's singing and felt the voice best suited to the new material was Wetton's own. He left Asia amicably.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} {{career as a}} fitness professional, John Sitaras created his own system and, as he {{developed}} a good following, he embarked {{on a plan to}} open his own gym. His plan was financed by some well-known Wall Street clients, who put in nearly $1.5 million, and the club, Sitaras Fitness, opened in November 2007, in Upper East Side, Manhattan. It quickly became a place frequented by high-profile people from various fields, like business magnate George Soros, economist and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, journalist Charlie Rose, record executive <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> or NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 2008, the Triptych, 1976, sold at Sotheby's for €55.465million ($86.28million), then {{a record}} for the artist and the highest price paid for a postwar work of art at auction up to 2008. On 13 November 2013, Three Studies of Lucian Freud sold at Christie's New York for $142.4 million, surpassing both Triptych and 1976 in {{auctioned}} value, and more importantly claiming the record for highest auction price {{of a work of}} art at that time, a title previously held by the fourth version of Edvard Munch's Scream and now held by Willem de Kooning's Interchange. In September 2015 <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> sold de Kooning's oil painting Interchange for $300 million to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin.|$|E
25|$|<b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> {{was born}} in Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York, to Abraham Geffen and Batya Volovskaya (1909—1988). Geffen's mother owned a {{clothing}} store in Borough Park called Chic Corsets by Geffen. Both of his parents were Jewish immigrants who met in British-mandated Palestine and then moved to the United States. Geffen graduated from Brooklyn's New Utrecht High School in 1960 with a 66 percent average. He attended the University of Texas at Austin for a semester, and then Brooklyn College, before again dropping out. He then moved to Los Angeles, California {{to find his way}} in the entertainment business. He attended Santa Monica College (then known as Santa Monica City College) in Santa Monica, California, but soon left. Geffen attributed his challenges in school to dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|While she {{was playing}} one night in the Gaslight South, a club in Coconut Grove, Florida, David Crosby walked in and was {{immediately}} struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. He took her back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts, who had a close business association with <b>David</b> <b>Geffen.</b> Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. Crosby convinced a record company to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at the time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when Reprise Records released her debut album, alternatively known as Joni Mitchell or Song to a Seagull.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 the New York Philharmonic {{moved from}} Carnegie Hall to Philharmonic Hall (now <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> Hall) {{in the new}} Lincoln Center. The move was not without {{controversy}} because of acoustic problems with the new hall. Bernstein conducted the gala opening concert featuring vocal works by Mahler, Beethoven and Vaughan Williams, and the premiere of Aaron Copland's Connotations, a serial-work that was merely politely received. During the intermission Bernstein kissed the cheek of the President's wife Jacqueline Kennedy, a break with protocol that was commented on at the time. In 1961 Bernstein had conducted at President John F. Kennedy's pre-inaugural gala, {{and he was an}} occasional guest in the Kennedy White House. Years later he conducted at the funeral mass in 1968 for the late President Kennedy's brother Robert Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 the Whitney Museum of American Art paid $1 {{million for}} Three Flags (1958), then {{the highest price}} ever paid {{for the work of}} a living artist. In 1988, Johns' False Start was sold at auction at Sotheby's to Samuel I. Newhouse, Jr. for $17.05 million, setting a record at the time as the highest price paid for a work by a living artist at auction, and the second highest price paid for an artwork at auction in the U.S. In 2006, private {{collectors}} Anne and Kenneth Griffin (founder of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel LLC) bought False Start (1959) from <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> for $80 million, making it the most expensive painting by a living artist. On November 11, 2014, a 1983 version of Flag was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York for $36 million, establishing a new auction record for Johns.|$|E
25|$|<b>David</b> <b>Geffen,</b> {{founder of}} Geffen Records {{and one of}} the play's financiers, leased the Dreamgirls film rights to Warner Bros. in the 1980s through his Geffen Pictures company. Although the film was {{announced}} several times, with singers such as Whitney Houston (as Deena), Lauryn Hill (another Deena candidate), and Kelly Price (as Effie) tapped to star, the studio eventually abandoned the project. Geffen eventually began development on the film at DreamWorks SKG, a company he co-founded, in 2004. Warner Bros., which controlled the film rights to Dreamgirls, was also originally announced as a co-financier of the film, but before shooting began, Paramount Pictures stepped in as co-producer after Warner expressed concerns over the film's budget. Laurence Mark served as producer of the DreamWorks/Paramount adaptation of Dreamgirls, written and directed by Bill Condon, who had earned an Oscar nomination for his screenplay adaptation of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|According to Forbes ("The 400 Richest Americans of 2004") {{and other}} sources, Geffen {{has pledged to}} give {{whatever}} money he makes from now on to charity, although he has not specified which charities or the manner of his giving. In 2002, he announced a $200million unrestricted endowment for the School of Medicine at UCLA. The School thereafter was named <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> School of Medicine at UCLA. Along with Kenneth Langone's gift to New York University School of Medicine, Geffen's donation is the largest donation ever made to a medical school in the United States. On December 13, 2012, UCLA announced that Geffen had donated another $100 million {{in addition to his}} 2002 donation of $200 million, making him the largest individual benefactor for the UC system. The latest donation funds the full cost of attendance for up to 30 students per year, beginning with the Class of 2017.|$|E
25|$|John Sitaras is an American fitness professional, {{the creator}} of the Sitaras Method and the founder of Sitaras Fitness in New York City. The method {{developed}} by him supposes an initial comprehensive evaluation system similar to a general medical examination, in order to design individualized routines according to each student's genetic aptitude, level of fitness, health conditions, and personal goals. As the students make progress, the evaluation is resumed periodically to reassess the routines and track their physical changes. He is the personal trainer of several high-profile people from various fields, like business magnate George Soros, economist and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch (who recovered from muscular atrophy under Sitaras' supervision), journalist Charlie Rose, record executive <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> or NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson (who was the first racing driver to become the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and who won seven championships).|$|E
25|$|The {{graduate}} {{instructional programs}} emphasize doctoral studies and {{are dominated by}} science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.

The most popular options are Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. Applicants for graduate studies are required to take the GRE. GRE Subject scores are either required or strongly recommended by several options. A joint program between Caltech and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, and the UCLA <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> School of Medicine grants MD/PhD degrees. Students in this program do their preclinical and clinical work at USC or UCLA, and their PhD work with any member of the Caltech faculty, including the Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering and Applied Sciences Divisions. The MD degree would be from USC or UCLA and the PhD would be awarded from Caltech.|$|E
25|$|Musician Rudy Vallee {{was one of}} the building's {{earliest}} residents. Ginger Rogers was one of {{its residents}} during her Broadway days in the early 1930s.

Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said, [...] "You ought to do The Ten Commandments." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison first {{recorded}} [...] "Dark Horse" [...] at his Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire, in November 1973. Along with tracks by future Dark Horse Records acts Ravi Shankar and Splinter, Harrison included the song on a tape he compiled for music-business executive <b>David</b> <b>Geffen</b> before departing for India in late January 1974. This early, unfinished version of [...] "Dark Horse" [...] featured Harrison on acoustic guitar and guide vocal, bassist Klaus Voormann and Ringo Starr on drums, {{and it is}} noticeably slower in tempo than the official release.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{performing}} the song throughout both the 1974 tour and his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton, his only other tour {{as a solo}} artist, Harrison recorded [...] "Dark Horse" [...] {{a number of times}} before and after the officially released studio version.
