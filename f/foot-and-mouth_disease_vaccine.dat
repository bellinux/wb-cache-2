40|$|We have rationally {{engineered}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> {{virus to}} increase its stability against thermal dissociation into subunits without disrupting the many biological functions needed for its infectivity. Amino acid side chains located near the capsid intersubunit interfaces and either predicted or found to be dispensable for infectivity were replaced by others that could establish new disulfide bonds or electrostatic interactions between subunits. Two engineered viruses were normally infectious, genetically stable, and antigenically indistinguishable from the natural virus but showed substantially increased stability against irreversible dissociation. Electrostatic interactions mediated this stabilizing effect. For <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus and other viruses, some evidence had suggested that an increase in virion stability could be linked to an impairment of infectivity.

The monolayer cells (99 th passage level) used to initiate the suspension cultures and the fully adapted suspension cells were shown to have an aneuploid chromosome karyotype, whereas earlier monolayer cultures (32 nd passage level) had a pseudodiploid karyotype. Replicate virus titrations in monolayers prepared from suspension-adapted cells, IB-RS- 2 monolayer cells, BHK monolayer cells, and in suckling mice showed that the suspension cells had retained sensitivity to foot-and-mouth disease virus.

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate {{about the use of}} the {{so-called}} ¿vaccinate-to-live¿ policy for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe, according to which, spread of the FMD virus (FMDV) from future outbreaks could be controlled by a short period of ¿emergency¿ vaccination of surrounding herds, reducing the need for large-scale pre-emptive culling of at-risk animals. Since vaccinated animals may become subclinically infected with FMDV following challenge exposure, it is necessary to either remove all vaccinates (vaccinate-to-kill) or to detect and remove vaccinates in which virus is circulating or has established persistent infections (vaccinate-to-live), in order to rapidly regain the most favoured trading status of FMD-free without vaccination. The latter approach can be supported by testing vaccinated animals for the presence of antibodies to certain non-structural proteins (NSP) of FMDV, which are induced by infection with the virus, but not by vaccination with purified FMD vaccines. Using test sensitivity and specificity data established at a recent workshop on NSP assays [Brocchi E, Bergmann I, Dekker A, Paton DJ, Sammin DJ, Greiner M, et al.

Reaginic antibodies demonstrated by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in goats, were directed against BHK 21 cell extracts (20), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (3) and an unidentified vaccine component (3), and distributed in 0, 5, 19 and 75 per cent of the cattle vaccinated 0, 1, 2 and 3 times. None of the animals showed clinical signs of allergy after vaccination. When BHK 21 cell extract was injected intradermally a significant correlation was noted between the development of large weals {{and the presence of}} reagins although the size of the weals was not correlated with the reagin titres. In the case of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose a similar trend was evident. The majority of cattle with large dermal weals possessed reagins but the number of reactions was too small for statistical evaluation. Dermal reactions to sodium penicillin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, saponin and whole vaccine occurred in both unvaccinated and vaccinated cattle but BHK 21 cell lysate and normal bovine serum provoked weals which increased in frequency according to the number of vaccinations experienced.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of an inactivated <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) <b>vaccine</b> is mainly {{dependent on the}} integrity of the <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) particles. At present, the standard method to quantify the active component, the 146 S antigen, of FMD vaccines is sucrose density gradient (SDG) analysis. However, this method is highly operator dependent and difficult to automate. In contrast, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a time-saving technique that provides greater simplicity and sensitivity. To establish a valid method to detect and quantify the 146 S antigen of a serotype O FMD vaccine, a double-antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA was compared with an SDG analysis. The DAS ELISA was highly correlated with the SDG method (R 2 = 0. 9215, P< 0. 01). In contrast to the SDG method, the DAS ELISA was rapid, robust, repeatable and highly sensitive, with a minimum quantification limit of 0. 06 μg/mL. This method can be used to determine the effective antigen yields in inactivated vaccines and thus represents an alternative for assessing the potency of FMD vaccines in vitro. But it still needs to be prospectively validated by analyzing a new vaccine preparation and determining the proper protective dose followed by an in vivo vaccination-challenge study to confirm the ELISA findings...|$|R

This transient response in some cattle was repeated after successive vaccinations but, in general, more animals responded as the number of vaccinations increased. After exposure to infection a transient VIA antibody response was occasionally observed in immune AEI-vaccinated animals. Some immune repeatedly AEI-vaccinated cattle did not develop detectable VIA antibody after challenge despite the persistence of virus in oesophageal-pharyngeal (O/P) fluid. The presence of antibody to VIA antigen is not conclusive proof that vaccinated animals have been exposed to infection and field data must be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that medicinal herbs and their ingredients enhance immune responses to vacci-nation against infectious diseases (Liu & Xiao, 1992; Rajput et al., 2007 a). Medicinal herbs {{have a variety}} of effects on immune responses and co-administration of vaccine with herbal extracts shows an increase in antibody response as well as enhancement in prolife-rative response of T cells (Hu et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2007). Some adjuvants such as Quillaja saponaria-A extracts (Quil-A) or extracts from Cochinchina mo-mordica seed (ECMS) have proven to be very effective for enhancing immune responses with the commercial <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) <b>vaccine</b> (Xiao et al., 2007 a,b,c).

ECMS is a crude extract made from seed of the Chinese traditional medicinal plant Momordica cochinchinensis and its immunomodulatory effects have been reported in vaccines against influenza-H 5 N 1 (Rajput et al., 2007 b), infectious bursal disease (Rajput et al., 2010) and newcastle disease (Xiao et al., 2009) in chicken. The immunomodulatory effect of ECMS was also reported against foot-and-mouth disea-se vaccination in Guinea pigs and pigs (Xiao et al., 2007 c), and in mice (Sakwiwatkul et al., 2010).

40|$|We {{have used}} a novel method, surface-enhanced laser {{desorption}} ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS), to characterize <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) <b>vaccine</b> antigens. Using specific capture with FMDV binding recombinant antibody fragments and tryptic digestion of FMDV antigens the spectral peaks representing the FMDV structural proteins VP 1, VP 2, VP 3 and VP 4 were identified. VP 1 existed as 2 variants differing by 0. 2 kDa and VP 4 as 8 variants differing by 14 – 17 Da. Such heterogeneities have not been reported earlier. They could represent oxidation of VP 4 and N-glycation of VP 1. We also detected FMDV proteolysis upon incubation at elevated temperatures and impurities in FMDV antigen preparations. Finally, we could also characterize FMDV antigen present in emulsions with oil adjuvant by SELDI-TOF-MS.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) <b>vaccines</b> contain oil-adjuvant. Their potency decreases upon prolonged storage. Intact (146 S) FMDV particles can dissociate into 12 S {{degradation products}} with a concomitant decrease in immunogenicity.

Virions completely dissociated into 12 S particles within 3 months after oil-emulsification. Dissociation {{occurred at a}} much lower rate in a comparable aqueous solution that was not oil-emulsified. Thus, oil-emulsification stimulates virion dissociation, presumably due to the protein denaturing effect of the oil–water interface. In real-time stability studies the stability of oil-adjuvanted virions of four different FMDV strains was significantly increased by addition of sucrose and BSA in a synergistic manner. Contrary to BSA addition, the effect of sucrose addition was concentration dependent.

40|$|Inactivated {{whole virus}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) <b>vaccines</b> are used {{worldwide}} for protection against FMD, {{but not all}} vaccines induce protection against all genetic variants of the same FMD virus serotype. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether the “breadth” of the antibody response against different strains of the same FMD virus serotype in cattle could be improved by using a different adjuvant, a mix of antigens and/or different routes of administration. To this end, six groups of five cattle were vaccinated with different FMD virus serotype A strain vaccines formulated with Montanide ISA 206 VG adjuvant. Antibody responses for homologous and heterologous cross-reactivity against a panel of 10 different FMD virus serotype A strains were tested by a liquid-phase blocking ELISA. Results of cattle vaccinated with ISA 206 VG adjuvanted vaccine were compared with results obtained in a previous study using aluminium hydroxide-saponin adjuvant. No significant effect of adjuvant on the breadth of the antibody response was observed, neither for mixing of antigens nor for the route of administration (subcutaneous vs. intradermal). Comparison of antigen payload, however, increased both homologous and heterologous titres; a 10 -fold higher antigen dose resulted in approximately four times higher titres against all tested strains. Our study shows that breadth of the antibody response depends mainly on the vaccine strain; we therefore propose that, for vaccine preparation, only FMD virus strains are selected that, among other important characteristics, will induce a wide antibody response to different field strains...|$|R

Findings were used to identify priority areas for future FMD vaccine research. Vaccines {{play a vital role in}} FMD control, used both to limit the spread of the virus during epidemics in FMD-free countries and as the mainstay of disease management in endemic regions, particularly where sanitary controls are difficult to apply. Improvements in the performance or cost-effectiveness of FMD vaccines will allow more widespread and efficient <b>disease</b> control. FMD <b>vaccines</b> have changed little in recent decades, typically produced by inactivation of whole virus, the quantity and stability of the intact viral capsids in the final preparation being key for immunogenicity. However, these are exciting times and several promising novel FMD vaccine candidates have recently been developed. This includes the first FMD vaccine licensed for manufacture and use in the USA; this adenovirus-vectored FMD vaccine causes in vivo expression of viral capsids in vaccinated animals. Another promising vaccine candidate comprises stabilized empty FMDV capsids produced in vitro in a baculovirus expression system. Recombinant technologies are also being developed to improve otherwise conventionally produced inactivated vaccines, for example, by creating a chimeric vaccine virus to increase capsid stability and by inserting sequences into the vaccine virus for desired antigen expression. Other important areas of ongoing research include enhanced adjuvants, vaccine quality control procedures and predicting vaccine protection from immune correlates, thus reducing dependency on animal challenge studies. Globally, the degree of independent vaccine evaluation is highly variable, and this is essential for vaccine quality.

To assess the relevance of B-cell epitope multivalency, dendrimers bearing two (B 2 T) or four (B 4 T) copies of the B-cell epitope from type O FMDV (a widespread circulating serotype) were tested in CD 1 mice and showed that multivalency is advantageous over simple B-T-epitope juxtaposition, resulting in efficient induction of neutralizing antibodies and optimal release of IFN γ. Interestingly, the bivalent B 2 T construction elicited similar or even better B- and T-cell specific responses than tetravalent B 4 T. In addition, {{the presence of the}} T-cell epitope and its orientation were shown to be critical for the immunogenicity of the linear juxtaposed monovalent peptides analyzed in parallel.

Due to underreporting of FMD, the current strains circulating throughout sub-Saharan Africa are in many cases unknown. For SAT 1, SAT 2, and serotype A viruses, the genetic diversity is reflected in antigenic variation, and indications are that vaccine strains may be needed for each topotype. This has serious implications for control using vaccines and for choice of strains to include in regional antigen banks. The epidemiology is further {{complicated by the fact that}} SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3 viruses are maintained and spread by wildlife, persistently infecting African buffalo in particular. Although the precise mechanism of transmission of FMD from buffalo to cattle is not well understood, it is facilitated by direct contact between these two species. Once cattle are infected they may maintain SAT infections without the further involvement of buffalo. No single strategy for control of FMD in Africa is applicable. Decision on the most effective regional control strategy should focus on an ecosystem approach, identification of primary endemic areas, animal husbandry practices, climate, and animal movement. Within each ecosystem, human behavior could be integrated in disease control planning. Different regions in sub-Saharan Africa are at different developmental stages and are thus facing unique challenges and priorities in terms of veterinary disease control. Many science-based options targeting improved vaccinology, diagnostics, and other control measures have been described. This review therefore aims to emphasize, on one hand, the progress that has been achieved in the development of new technologies, including research towards improved tailored vaccines, appropriate vaccine strain selection, vaccine potency, and diagnostics, and how it relates to the conditions in Africa. On the other hand, we focus on the unique epidemiological, ecological, livestock farming and marketing, socioeconomic, and governance issues that constrain effective FMD control. Any such new technologies should have the availability of safe livestock products for trade as the ultimate goal.
