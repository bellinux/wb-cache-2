We inquire into this contrasting picture {{between theory and practice}} through an in-depth case study that suggests that what begins as customer dependence transforms into vulnerability to employees. While perceived vulnerability to customers is efficiently removed through <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>controls,</b> the physical asset specificity in each customer order generates task uncertainty, specialization and teamwork, which become the new sources of opportunism threat for the customization providers.

It is generally assumed that courts follow legislative design in enforcing the intended structure and substance of legislation, subject to potential ideological bias. We show that this assumption is, for structural reasons, not warranted. In public law litigation, courts are asked to reconstitute agency operations, but they reluctantly take on the assignment. Rather, they give the agency and plaintiffs an opportunity to achieve consensus on substantive issues that will, if legal, receive judicial imprimatur as a remedy.

30|$|In conclusion, the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart {{is an easy}} to setup, understand, and {{interpret}} tool which focuses on monitoring the schedule performance of a project. In addition, it can be constructed without needing the cost-related data. However, in this paper, our analysis is limited to monitor the schedule performance of projects, {{and it may be}} extended to monitor the other aspects of project performance. Besides, the higher performance of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart in detecting abnormal behavior of the project progress for different possible scenarios does not necessarily assure that this approach is the best available tool for project monitoring and should be investigated more deeply in real-life projects. In addition, the effect of critical and near-critical activities on the performance of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart may require further investigation.|$|R
30|$|When the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart {{is used in}} {{practice}} concerns may arise that {{must be considered in}} advance. In the first place, it is good to say that, in this paper, fictitious projects with simulated data have been used to measure the capability of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart. Although, the results reveal that this chart has a relatively reliable performance for all possible scenarios that can occur {{in practice}}, however, the projects may differ while having some commonalities. For example, in reality, sometimes a small change in one characteristic of a project (such as uncertainty) may make a critical difference in the final status of the project. Therefore, the performance analysis of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart can be extended to the real project data sets with empirical project data. To better understand and improve the performance of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart, interested readers are encouraged to implement the proposed control chart in their projects. In addition, operations research and scheduling research group has cleverly made an excellent empirical project database which is freely available at www.projectmanagement.ugent.be. At the time of writing this paper, 91 projects are available there that provides information such as baseline schedule, risk analysis, and project control for free.|$|R
30|$|For illustrative purposes, {{application}} of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart has been demonstrated using a fictitious project.

It also has a low rate of false alarms which prevents a lot of unnecessary effort to find out the source(s) of variation.|$|R

30|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increasing}} interest in developing project control systems. The primary purpose of such systems is to indicate whether the actual performance is consistent with the baseline and to produce a signal in the case of non-compliance. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in monitoring project’s performance indicators, by plotting them on the Shewhart-type control charts over time. However, these control charts are fundamentally designed for processes and ignore project-specific dynamics, which can lead to weak results and misleading interpretations. By paying close attention to the project baseline schedule and using statistical foundations, this paper proposes a new <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart which discriminates between acceptable (as-planned) and non-acceptable (not-as-planned) variations of the project’s schedule performance. Such control chart enables project managers to set more realistic thresholds leading to a better decision making for taking corrective and/or preventive actions. For the sake of clarity, an illustrative example has been presented to show how the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart is constructed in practice. Furthermore, an experimental investigation has been set up to analyze the performance of the proposed control chart. As expected, the results confirm that, when a project starts to deflect significantly from the project’s baseline schedule, the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart shows a respectable ability to detect and report right signals while avoiding false alarms.|$|R
40|$|On battlefields {{and within}} organizations, a fog obscures {{subordinate}} activity from superior observation, producing an information asymmetry endemic to most superior-subordinate relationships. A superior’s ability to observe, to peer through this fog, distinguishes {{different types of}} organizations, largely determining what tasks an organization may accomplish and how superior control is balanced against subordinate autonomy (James Wilson, 2000). Yet modern technology is lifting this fog, with each day increasing the detail and depth of what superiors may observe. This thesis explores superior control with modern technology, by introducing and assessing a new term, nanomanagement—where superiors use technology to control, in ever-increasing detail, the actions of all of their subordinates. Through interviewing mid-level officers of the U. S. and British armies, who served in Iraq between 2003 and 2008, this qualitative study explores two questions. “Why nanomanagement?” seeks to understand the causes, or what may motivate nanomanagement. “How does nanomanagement influence superior control and subordinate autonomy?” seeks to understand the effects of nanomanagement. This thesis employs five factors—organizational culture, <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>controls,</b> ex post controls, hierarchical control and exogenous factors—as different theoretical frameworks to understand nanomanagement. Trackers, drones and long screwdrivers, modern variants of police patrols that reduce transaction costs and may reverse information asymmetry, are introduced. This thesis also suggests three terms to describe when nanomanaging superiors take action undermining traditional hierarchical control: shifting (focusing attention on subordinate levels), drifting (acting at subordinate levels), and grifting (cheating the hierarchy by controlling actions at levels beneath their immediate subordinates). These actions signal {{a new form of}} hierarchical control by exclusion—ex claudere control. By analyzing a case where much of the fog separating superior from subordinate thinned and lifted, this thesis assesses and updates the long fought battle between superior control and subordinate autonomy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critique the modernisation of an essential public service – Air Navigation Services (ANS) – since the early 1980 s. The paper focuses on the changes to the financial management and accountability regimes of four Anglo-American ANS providers. Frederickson and Smith (2003) state that lines of political control and hierarchical authority have been strained by the devolution of regulatory policy to autonomous entities. Traditional notions of parliamentary accountability have suffered with the emergence of collaborative forms of governance and alternative delivery systems. Nevertheless, the public holds government ultimately responsible for the performance of ANS providers. In order to protect the 'public interest' while maintaining arm’s length control, various governments have introduced 'managerialist' instruments of accounting, budgetary control, auditing and quality assurance (Lapsley, 2008). The modernisation of ANS are examined using Considine’s (2001) governance models and the financial management and accountability technologies utilised to implement control and monitor change. Fundamental issues in the financial management reforms are accountability, accounting and reporting, and performance monitoring (English et al., 2005, p. 23). A contextual, historical view of ANS from the mid 1980 s to 2007 is provided with a view to identifying and accounting for the pattern of similarities and differences in reform trajectories. The findings from the four cases studied highlight a move away from <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>controls</b> (rules), towards ex post control systems in which outcomes are held up to scrutiny through financial reporting mechanisms. Data reveals a significant increase in the use of quantitative performance indicators (PI) and performance audit. However, their prevalence and type are not uniform across all governance models for ANS. In conclusion, it is argued that there is no single model of public service modernisation. In practice, the diffusion and adoption of new reform doctrines varies from one location to another, reflecting the different weightings attached by reformers to traditional and new public service values. 30 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In this Article, I study a {{fascinating}} problem - {{what are the}} legal, political and economic implications of regulating executive bonuses? While the Administration 2 ̆ 7 s recent consideration of proposals to tax bonuses of AIG executives has sparked {{a great deal of}} media speculation and attention, there has been little legal scholarship discussing the various possible consequences of this and other methods of regulating executive compensation. Especially given the growing interest in executive compensation and the possible benefits and costs of regulation in this arena, I believe this paper will make a significant scholarly contribution to the existing literature on corporate governance and tax policy with respect to executive compensation. While the media has focused on public outrage and resulting political pressures to punish executives that took excessive risk while compensating themselves handsomely, the little legal literature on the subject has focused almost exclusively on constitutional and contractual dimensions. Economists and scholars of human capital, however, also raise issues around potential disincentive effects of such measures (for instance, would excessive controls on compensation dissuade talent from seeking such jobs?). In addition, there is an ongoing debate on {{whether or not there is}} even a relationship between executive incentive mechanisms and firm performance - while some scholars argue that performance-contingent compensation does indeed improve firm-level financial outcomes others argue just the opposite. In general, the literature on incentive effects and the pay for performance relationship has the potential to inform the current debate on taxing executive bonuses. In sum, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no attempt to integrate or synthesize the different factors - legal, political, and economic- that impact the potential costs and benefits of taxing or otherwise regulating executive bonuses and other forms of incentive compensation retroactively. I conduct a systematic review of the legal studies literature and the literature on incentive effects of executive bonuses, and consolidate them into a concise, simple framework that distinguishes <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>controls</b> on compensation with ex post controls, and contrasts process-oriented policy options with content-oriented ones. As I offer a concise and comprehensive account of the various factors that affect the costs and benefits of regulating executive compensation and identify unanswered issues, legal and other, I conclude that no single policy is going to act as a “silver bullet. ” My critical review of each of these policy choices reveals that the problems associated with executive compensation are endemic to the flawed U. S. corporate governance structure, and thus cannot be mitigated without fundamental structural reform in that broader system...|$|E
30|$|This section {{presents}} {{our findings}} {{on the performance of}} the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart in detecting out of plan situations. By the previously described methodology and with respect to the values of SP, δ_I, and δ_II, we have a total of 9 × 4 × 5 = 180 simulation experiments. Table  3 summarizes the AUC values for different scenarios as a measure of discrimination. Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) provide general rules for interpreting AUC values which can be paraphrased as follows (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000). Value AUC = 0.5 indicates the situation in which true and false signals are generated based on a Bernoulli trial. While the AUC value moves towards one, the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart provides more adequate discrimination. In this case, the true and false alarm rates tend to one and zero, respectively, which is the optimal situation.|$|R
30|$|Some {{efficient}} measures should {{measure the}} ability of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart to detect abnormal behavior of the project progress. For this purpose, three performance assessment measures have been proposed. The first measure is the true alarm rate which refers to the probability of truly detecting an abnormal situation for a particular scenario. This measure defines how many correct signals generate among all review periods available during the project execution. It is calculated by dividing the total number of signals produced by the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart to the number of review periods in which one or more activities exist with an ahead-of-schedule or behind-of-schedule situation. The second measure is the false alarm rate which refers to the probability of falsely detecting an abnormal situation. This measure defines how many wrong signals generated among all review periods available during the project execution. A false alarm occurs when a signal is generated even if all the activities are executed as planned.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we explain}} our {{statistical}} project control approach. A control chart {{is a very}} useful technique for process monitoring which analyzes process variations with data points plotted in time order. Since processes do same things repeatedly in an infinite time span, process data can be gathered over time with different sample sizes. However, commenting on the current literature, we state that projects are fundamentally different from processes since these are executed in a finite time span. In addition, there are few samples in each review period {{because the number of}} performance indicators is limited for a certain review period. The alert reader has already noticed that when the standard control charts are used for the project control, some project-specific assumptions are not fairly considered and may be ignored. Therefore, despite having common characteristics with the classical approaches, our control chart is functionally different. In the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart, input data are simulated within a user-defined range which can be derived either from historical data or through expert judgments. This is what we do in risk analysis to identify the weak parts of the network which may jeopardize the project. Therefore, <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart does not suffer from the small sample size per time unit since there are a large number of simulated samples for each review period. In addition, unlike the standard control charts, common cause variations in an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart are connected directly to the baseline schedule, and a special cause variation occurs when the schedule performance falls outside the acceptable area.|$|R
40|$|Explaining {{the form}} of public sector {{organizations}} is a major contribution that organizational theory has to offer {{to the study of}} the public sector. In this chapter, we investigate the characteristics of the relationships between agencies and their parent administration in the Italian central government. The study, rooted in organizational theory, adopts different theoretical angles, at first a ‘cultural-normative’ approach mainly embedded in a logic of appropriateness perspective (March and Olsen, 1989, 1994, 1996), then an approach focused on instrumental rationality mainly embedded in a logic of consequences perspective (for an overview of different streams in organization theory for the study of the public sector, see Christensen et al., 2007). Governments in many countries have established semi-autonomous single-purpose organizations (OECD, 2002), to which we refer as public agencies, and Italy has been no exception in this respect (Ongaro, 2006 and 2008). How to wield the control function towards agencies has become a prominent area of research in public management studies. Many studies address the topic of control as a ‘systemic’ issue, as the notion of control has been related to the way the relationships among various actors are coordinated in order to achieve a common (public) goal (Kaufmann, 1986). Other studies deal with the concept of control as an inter-organizational coordination tool (Klijn, 2005; Narad, 2006; Verhoest et al., 2007). Other authors have explored the control topic as an accountability-related theme (Bovens et al., 2008; Gregory, 2003; Mulgan, 2000) or even more generally as a central issue in public administration and public management reform (Kettl, 2000; Romzek, 2000). As a starting point, we may assume that there are two broad modalities whereby control of agencies is exercised: <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>controls</b> and ex post controls. <b>Ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>controls</b> (Thompson, 1993; Verhoest et al., 2004; Wirth, 1986) refer to a broad set of mechanisms ranging from the appointment of the director general/CEO and the members of the board to the definition of rules and standards by the parent organization to which the agency has to comply (constraining the behaviour in order to steer the agency towards the outputs desired by the parent administration). This perspective refers both to the formal-bureaucratic aspects of the ministry-agency relationship (Egeberg, 2003) and to other forms of control that can be read (also) through the lens of the theory of clans (Ouchi, 1980) – whereby control is pursued through the selection and appointments of top executives having clannish relations (in the sense clarified by Ouchi) with the ‘political master’ in the parent administration. The second perspective is based on the assumption that the ‘parent’ administration can steer and control ‘its’ agency by setting the goals it is expected to pursue and controlling ex post their achievement. This second perspective largely refers to the management control and performance management literature (Bouckaert and Halligan, 2008; Bouckaert and van Dooren, 2003; Laegried et al., 2006 a; Moynihan, 2006) and has important roots in the concept of ‘Management by Objectives and Results’: it is a performance management concept that ‘entails a redoubled attempt to operationalize goals for government and to use these goals more actively both in choosing between alternative actions and in evaluating results’ (Christensen et al., 2007, p. 89). Ex post control, or result-based control, concerns the assignment of goals to the agency and the assessment by the parent administration of the degree of achievement of the goals by the agency, as well as the possible execution of sanctions or attribution of rewards associated to the achievement of goals. The complex nature of the relationships between the parent administration and the agency based on a performance management logic has recently been studied with reference to the autonomy-control balance (Verschuere, 2007; see also Barbieri and Ongaro, 2008) or as an indicator of ‘NPMness’ of such relationships (Verhoest et al., 2004; Verschuere and Barbieri, 2009). This chapter addresses the question of what are the determinants of result-based forms of control. The analysis is focused on the ex post result control for three main reasons: the already extensive literature on ex ante control instruments on Italian agencies, which contrasts with the absence (to our knowledge) of any systematic investigation of the determinants of result-based controls; the chance to compare the findings on the impact of the selected independent variables (age, staff size, budget size, type of task and policy field) with investigations performed in other countries (see this book, and in the range of recent works on the topic the contributions by Laegreid et al., 2006 b; Verschuere, 2007); the opportunity to empirically investigate the degree of implementation of a major public management reform that occurred in Italy in 1999, that had the declared goal of introducing forms of result-based control in the Italian public sector. In the study of the determinants of result-based control, we have at first considered that the forms of control between the agency and the parent administration may be determined by institutionalisation processes that unfold over time under the influence of certain factors. We assume both ministries and agencies to be institutionalized organisations and we investigate their relationship on the basis of factors that may affect the organisational form of their relationship. Factors like age, size (in both budget and staff terms), the type of task executed, the policy field in which the agency and the ministry operate have been considered (on the ground of theoretical argumentations explained in the third section, in which the hypotheses about the influence of such factors on result-based control are formulated). A supplement of investigation was required, however, since the statistical analysis did not provide conclusive evidence about the influence such factors may have on {{the form of}} control. We then adopted a different perspective, and considered the reform processes that occurred in Italy over the last two decades (Ongaro, 2009). In the range of a number of reform programmes that were launched during that period in Italy, one can be singled out as regards the area of organisational form of central government agencies and the agency-ministry relationship; in fact, in 1999 a comprehensive reform of the central government prescribed, within the framework of a general re-organisation of the central government, the establishment of a number of new agencies patterned on a well-identified model, which can be easily recognized in the UK ‘Next Steps’ model of public agency. Though it is beyond the scope of this chapter to investigate the policy process that led to the enactment of this reform programme (to what extent it was a case of policy transfer from abroad, the way different policy alternatives were considered and how this one came to be selected, etc.), for the purposes of this work we may consider that a well-specified model of public agency, centred on result-based control, was intentionally introduced in the Italian central administration. From a hierarchically-oriented instrumental perspective on reform (Christensen et al., 2007, chapters 2 and 7), we may quite straightforwardly state that the executive government at the higher level forced the introduction of a new organisational form in the Italian central public administration. What have been the effects of this reform on ex post controls in the relationship between agencies and their parent administration? And has this new organisational form, and particularly the type of result-based control which is a central component of it, institutionalised over time? As illustrated in closer detail later in this chapter, this reform has led to establishing a set of agencies that can be singled out of the overall population of the investigated central government agencies because of their high level of result-control. However, the reform has been apparently not ‘institutionalized’ and the broader population of Italian central government agencies (encompassing those agencies established subsequently to the 1999 reform) displays a level of result-based control markedly different from that of the agencies established by the 1999 reform...|$|E

30|$|The {{first thing}} {{needs to be}} {{considered}} when the statistical control charts are being used for the project control is that the projects are different from processes. By understanding this difference, in this paper, an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart is proposed which has a particular attention on the project-specific assumptions while sharing some common characteristics with the classical charts. The <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart is constructed in two phases. Phase I analysis looks forward and constructs the control limits {{in such a way}} that the weak and strong parts of the baseline are considered. This phase enhances our understanding of how the schedule risk analysis can be used to define more realistic control limits. In addition, the way of data collection, sample sizes per each review period, project time span, and acceptable deviations are considered with a focus on the project-specific properties. Phase II analysis looks backward and compares the actual performance to the previously constructed limits. By doing so, project schedule performance anomalies can be accurately identified both in the positive and negative directions. The project control team can then examine the sources of variations. Taken together, these phases suggest a role for statistical control charts in promoting the project monitoring and control and enable the project manager to keep the project on track.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} issue {{that needs to}} be considered in monitoring the project schedule is that the critical path may be changed during the project execution. The original critical path is determined based on the CPM analysis on the baseline schedule. However, depending upon actual performance, usually due to significant delays in non-critical activities, the critical path may be changed. So, unlike the common perception, the critical path is dynamic. In this situation, the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart is yet applicable by recalculating the control limits based on updated information.|$|R
30|$|Phase I {{analysis}} aims at {{constructing the}} control limits {{used in the}} <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart. Hence, it is started with {{the selection of a}} logical endpoint for the project activities via the critical path method algorithm as a planned duration. Once the baseline schedule is created, we need to define the limits between which the fictitious actual durations should be generated. The idea behind these limits arises from the fact that activity durations are usually subject to some risks which should be identified and considered in advance. In addition, incomplete knowledge of the way the project is progressed may lead to some uncertainty in the activity durations which needs to be noticed before they occur. The fictitious actual durations in this phase are generated within limits specified by the phase I parameter δ_I = { 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 }. δ_I determines the distance between which a fictitious activity duration can be generated around its nominal duration. This allows us to consider different degrees of uncertainties for our experiments. For the sake of simplicity, in this paper we have opted to generate durations from the uniform distribution; however, in practice, any other distributions may be used. Monte Carlo simulations are now used to construct the control limits of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart from nrs simulation runs.|$|R
30|$|Our {{statistical}} {{project control}} approach has two distinct phases. Phase I starts before the project execution once the baseline schedule has been constructed via the baseline scheduling techniques. This phase allows the project manager to define tolerance {{limits of the}} schedule performance {{in such a way}} that the baseline schedule is fairly considered. Phase II starts with the execution of the project and continues to the project’s close-out. In this phase, we use the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart to monitor the schedule performance by comparing the actual progress against the control limits. These phases are described in the following subsections.|$|R
40|$|Two {{recent studies}} have shown that "cheap talk" is an {{effective}} means of eliminating positive hypothetical bias in experimental and field-auction settings. We further investigate the ability of cheap talk to mitigate positive hypothetical bias in a CVM phone survey administered to over 4, 000 households. Positive hypothetical bias is detected in our data by contrasting revealed and stated preference information. However, a short, neutral cheap-talk script appears to exacerbate rather than mitigate the bias. Based on this and mixed evidence from earlier studies, we suggest caution in using cheap talk as an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> for hypothetical bias.

We try to address the following question: which types of regulatory schemes are likely to promote innovation in a fast-growing telecommunications industry? Section 2 analyses <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> by sector-specific regulation and ex post control by competition policies. Section 3 deals with the importance of compatibility hence regulation of standards in the telecommunications industry. Section 4 discusses the major issues pertaining to the relation between innovation and pricing on the one hand, and innovation and unbundling on the other.

Index of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> of self-dealing transactions {{is based on}} the average of approval by disinterested shareholders and <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> disclosure. Index of ex post control over self-dealing transactions {{is based on the}} average of disclosure in periodic filings and ease of proving wrongdoing. First principal component of: (1) approval by disinterested shareholders; (2) disclosures by Buyer; (3) disclosures by the insider self-dealer; (4) independent review; (5) each of the elements in the index of disclosure in periodic filings; (6) standing to sue; (7) rescission; (8) ease of holding the insider self-dealer liable; (9) ease of holding the approving body liable; and (10) access to evidence. The index ranges from zero (weak private enforcement) to one (strong private enforcement). Source: Djankov et al. (2008).|$|R
40|$|When {{intervening}} in markets, say {{to block a}} merger, competition authorities are constrained by the limited information they have about the social desirability of the available alternatives. Compared to <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control,</b> <b>ex</b> post control {{is based on the}} more accurate information that becomes available in the intervening period, but entails temporary losses to social welfare and reversal costs incurred to unscramble the eggs. Through a toy model, we identify situations in which the competition authority finds it optimal to commit to forego the option of ex post review in order to avoid chilling <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> socially beneficial mergers. On the other hand, the case for ex post review is strengthened if post-merger market conducts can signal the merged firm's private information about the consequences of the merger.

40|$|We {{consider}} an incomplete contracting model of bilateral trade in intellectual property (IP) with sequential investments in its quality and with financial constraints. A financially-constrained inventor invests in an idea which she then sells to a buyer. The buyer in turn invests in developing this idea into a marketable product. We propose a novel formulation of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> rights of an IP buyer, over the financially-constrained IP seller. We do not assume alienability of the inventor’s ideas; the control right {{is defined as}} <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> prescribed prohibition of ex interim financial contracting with third parties. We show that such an agreement strengthens the seller’s <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> incentives {{to invest in the}} quality of her product which is to be traded at the interim stage. The enforcement of this control right is credible, or renegotiation-proof, only for the controlling buyer (a downstream user of the IP), and not for other potential partners of the seller, such as independent venture capitalists. We thereby obtain a rationale for a key role of Corporate Venturing in promoting innovative activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{a comment on}} Ronald Gilson and Alan Schwarz “Constraints on Private Benefits of Control: <b>Ex</b> <b>Ante</b> <b>Control</b> Mechanisms versus <b>Ex</b> Post Transaction Review”. Together with that paper it {{will appear in the}} Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics 169 (1) in 2013, in a special issue devoted to Behavioral Theory of Institutions. I argue that the {{arguments}} of Gilson and Schwarz are convincing, but that the underlying assumptions may be stronger than the authors suggest. In particular, the G&S paper adopts a US shareholder perspective on corporate governance and is based on standard rationality assumptions. In this comment, I discuss whether and to what extent the recommendations are relevant in the EU context and whether the paper’s conclusions are robust when insights from behavioral economics are included. ...|$|R
30|$|The third measure can {{be defined}} by the {{calculation}} of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). ROC concept came from the signal detection theory developed in World War II to analyze the radar performance on detecting a correct blip {{on the radar screen}} (Hanley and McNeil 1982). ROC is drawn by plotting the true alarm rate against the false alarm rate at various settings. Since the area under the ROC curve, also known as AUC, provides a single and unit-less measure, the discrimination performance which is the ability of the <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart to classify the true and false signals correctly can be measured. AUC can be computed either through the parametric (trapezoidal procedure) or nonparametric (maximum likelihood estimator) methods. Both methods are available in computer programs such as Minitab and Matlab.|$|R

30|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> chart {{uses the}} project’s {{baseline}} schedule {{to calculate the}} control limits between which natural variability is allowed. The idea behind {{this is that the}} project performance is impacted by the variations of the activity durations placed in the different parts of the baseline, as well as estimation, measurement and implementation errors coming from the impossibility to estimate, measure and implement the actual situation as it occurs. Hence, various scenarios of the activity duration estimates should be used here for the Phase I analysis. For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), as a well-known method to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty, is used to simulate actual duration values on certain user-defined ranges (Izadi and Kimiagari 2014; Rao and Naikan 2014; Chiadamrong and Piyathanavong 2017). Once the actual duration estimates of all working days are simulated for a number nrs of simulation runs, project performance indicators of each simulation run can be calculated for all review periods, by which the tolerance limits can be estimated.|$|R
40|$|The {{processes}} of transition and accession to the EU produced a fast {{expansion in the}} number of agencies and other public sector organizations in CEE. Between 1990 and 2004, many new organizations were established in order to implement new or reorganized functions of the democratic state, market economy and the EU member state. Agencies were created at a very high speed and with a larger scope than in most Western countries. Such a trend was counteracted by a major U-turn {{in the second half of}} the 2000 s, when all studied CEE countries experienced a de-agencification process facilitated by the financial crisis and the aim to rationalize public sector organization. The studies in this special issue show that there is a considerable variation in terms of organizational autonomy and control, both across and within individual countries, and a clear domination of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>control</b> over <b>ex</b> post control in the CEE region. Finally, politicization of agencies is identified as an important feature influencing their functioning in some CEE countries. </p...|$|R

This paper analyses the unregulated institutional frame {{by means of the}} theory of vertically related markets; the theoretically derived conclusions appear to be confirmed by empirical observation. The key policy lesson is that the principle of a level-playing field between vertically integrated firms and third parties is violated, due to different incentives if network-access charges are not regulated.
