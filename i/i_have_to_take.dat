500|$|J. Gresham Barrett {{brought up}} {{legislation}} in the U.S. House of Representatives which, among other things, referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Congress members Tom Lantos, Jim Saxton, Thad McCotter, Chris Shays, Charles Boustany, Alcee Hastings, and Robert Wexler referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in their speeches supporting the legislation. Shortly before a speech by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, U.S. Congressman Dennis Hastert said, [...] "He [...] denounces terrorism, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him at his word. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2008 {{a picture}} of Song was used in an ad for an escort agency in the LA Weekly. A rep from Disney told TMZ: [...] "This is an {{unauthorized}} use of Brenda Song's image and her personal attorney has issued a cease and desist to the advertiser." [...] Song filed a libel suit seeking $100,000 in damages. Song said: [...] "As a role model to millions of young people, I feel <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a stand against this company in regard to its exploitation of my image." [...] The settlement was announced in March 2009.|$|E
500|$|Crew members often {{complained about}} {{difficult}} shoots, with many quitting or being fired. Mary Parent was then brought in as a producer. Iñárritu stated {{that some of}} the crew members had left the film, explaining that [...] "as a director, if I identify a violin that is out of tune, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> that from the orchestra." [...] On his experience filming, DiCaprio stated: [...] "I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do. Whether it’s {{going in and out of}} frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, or what I ate on set. [...] enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{reach my}} {{favourite}} clearing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the fields on the left, and strike down {{hill in the}} direction of the sea. I hurried down the narrow path.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, miss, I {{mentioned}} that," [...] {{said the}} girl simply. [...] "The company coming, and the accident to the brindled cow, was all the news <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the farm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cap's {{a perfect}} fool about the cars," [...] said John. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him; Jennie's getting too heavy, I darsent take her." ...|$|R
500|$|Brad Renfro stars {{alongside}} McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, {{and by the end}} of the picture he had to become this empty vessel." [...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, [...] "It's a trip <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> People just kind of have to leave me alone when I'm doing it. It's my job." [...] Singer described his impression of the character: ...|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did {{not start}} the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a seat, that's just the way it has to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Marmaduke, [...] "I am in a fix. Affairs {{have become}} so uncomfortable at home that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up my {{quarters}} elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a pretty}} near thing. Does it strike you as curious that while you made {{yourself}} responsible for me <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, one o' {{the traces}} was welly i' two, an' <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it <b>to</b> Brady's to be mended, an' he didn't {{get it done}} i' time.' ...|$|R

The other nominees were Do <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> Care of Everything?, It's a Date, Tiny Plastic Men, Gangsta Granny and The Revolution Will Be Televised.

500|$|... "Single Ladies" [...] {{was first}} parodied in the November 15, 2008, episode of SNL, which {{featured}} Beyoncé. She was initially reluctant {{to participate in}} the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: [...] "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [...] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. So in that respect, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my hat off to them for doing it." [...] Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of [...] "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed [...] "Single Ladies" [...] in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of Britain's Got Talent, in a dance-off. They performed the choreography to raise funds for the UK campaign, Children In Need.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} eventually involved local, {{state and}} Federal authorities. In late April, Vick told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution [...] "I'm never at the house…I {{left the house}} with my family…They just haven't been doing the right thing…It's unfortunate <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the heat behind it.

6000|$|... "I {{suffered}} {{in that way}} just now," [...] said Reginald plaintively, [...] "from a woman whose word <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> that she <b>had</b> met me last summer in Brittany." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} she has got nine? Upon my honour she has!" [...] said her husband. [...] "This one is the sixth. Fancy if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them all over!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a letter}} <b>to</b> Highclose to Mrs. Tempest—from my mother, {{concerning}} a bazaar in {{process at the}} church. [...] "I will bring Leslie back with me," [...] said I to myself.|$|R
2500|$|Harrods {{was sold}} for £1.5 billion. Fayed later {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his dividend approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund. Fayed said [...] "I'm here every day, I can't take my profit because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a permission of those bloody idiots...I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee's permission to take my profit". Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he was scheduled to hold for at least six months.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to {{end of the}} West Indies {{domestic}} season, Australia {{toured the}} Caribbean. Having not been selected for either the Test series or the initial or the first three ODIs, Miller was [...] "surprised" [...] {{to be one of}} three new players called up for the final two ODIs in St Kitts, replacing Suliemann Benn. [...] "I was looking out for it [...] because I had a good season so I always kept my mind in tune for that call so that I won't be surprised," [...] said Miller. [...] "I was disappointed [...] but now that I got the chance <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it with both hands." [...] The West Indies had already lost the series 30.|$|E

6000|$|... "By all means, Colonel. Their uniforms {{do not fit}} as well as I should like, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them as {{they were}} served out, and have had no {{opportunity}} of getting them altered." ...|$|R
6000|$|I paid {{assessments}} on [...] "Hale and Norcross" [...] {{until they}} sold me out, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in washing for a living--and {{the next month}} that infamous stock went up to $7,000 a foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way I can get my living," [...] said the butterfly. [...] "Nobody ever gives me anything, and so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> what I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] she said, [...] "I think it's fine. You see, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it down so fast I can't always {{follow it}} as I'd like to." ...|$|E
6000|$|She shook me again. [...] "You know I don't. But it isn't {{the nice}} people that take best care of themselves. Tom can't. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I got the dollars. I don't {{know that}} it was quite the square thing, but with Harper's wife and the Dutchman's {{children}} 'most starving in the hollow, <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'April 1st.--My fortieth birthday. It brings solemn thoughts. Last night <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the service}} at St. Paul's, and as I came back I thought of many things, and principally of how very {{different}} I {{ought to be}} from what I am.|$|R
6000|$|... “I think so, Pita. I {{will fix}} its {{bearings}} in my mind, and notice the direction <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on leaving the hut. I wish I had my gun and pistols.” ...|$|E
60|$|I bowed, {{and said}} no more. So there the matter rests, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my own course. I have had a survey made, and {{on the head of}} it the Tunnel to the harbour is begun.|$|E
