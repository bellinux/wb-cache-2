500|$|On August 6, 2005, MAD TV {{reported}} that Despina Vandi was [...] "seriously considering" [...] representing Greece in 2006 {{and would be}} or possibly already had been proposed to by ERT to be the Greek entrant. Vandi had been asked previously to represent {{the country at the}} 2005 contest, but declined, fearing a bad result while her international career was going well. A few months later on December 12, 2005, Star Channel announced that ERT would soon officially propose to a different artist, Anna Vissi, to be the representative. Vissi said in reply that she [...] "never [...] a Eurovision Song Contest participation as long as everything is organized well". She had participated in the contest twice before: in 1980 with [...] "Autostop" [...] for Greece and in 1982 for Cyprus with the song [...] "Mono I Agapi", placing 13th and 5th respectively. She had also attempted {{to take part in the}} contest in several other years, either failing to win against other artists or having deals not materialize. An official announcement was not made soon after as no agreement could be made at the time, but one month later on January 24, 2006, Vissi was officially announced as the artist for 2006. A few days later in an interview with the press, she said, [...] "finally , <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Eurovision too much". She said the final decision took so long to be announced because she was still debating entering, using opinion polls along with talking to her usual collaborators. It was also announced that Vissi would sing either four or five songs live at the national final to choose her song.|$|E

Despite Ventura's concerns about his English, he also initially approved Friedkin's proposal. However, after McQueen backed out, Ventura was hesitant to take part in the movie.

After the disagreement with McQueen, Friedkin approached Robert Mitchum who, despite appreciating the script, sternly declined, asking Friedkin [...] "Why would <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Ecuador for two or three months to fall out of a truck?
