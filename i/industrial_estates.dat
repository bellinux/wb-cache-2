5|$|The recent strong {{economic}} growth and lower unemployment in the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: unemployment in the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%.

5|$|A {{civilian}} government {{was established in}} 1922 with its headquarters at Koror, replacing the military administration. The {{civilian government}} initiated a programme to identify and collectivise unused land between 1923 and 1932 for redevelopment. Much of these land were used to build new <b>industrial</b> <b>estates</b> and expand towns to accommodate immigrants from Japan and Okinawa. In Japan, the government actively encouraged the Japanese and Okinawans to resettle in Micronesia, including Palau, and began establishing farming settlements. The first farming settlement was established at Ngaremlengui in 1926, but the settlers encountered problems with its humid tropical environment and abandoned it by 1930, although later settlements were established more successfully.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of <b>industrial</b> <b>estates</b> and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|Rovers Tye Farm, a pub since 1983, was {{established}} by 1353, and a causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route.

The toothpaste tube manufacturer Betts opened a factory at No.505 Ipswich Road in 1953. More recently there have been the development of housing and <b>industrial</b> <b>estates</b> along the road, particularly automobile dealers, at the northern end where it meets the A12.|$|E
5|$|The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was {{a product}} of the Craigavon {{development}} when large tracts of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms. Other industrial areas in the town are Annesborough and Halfpenny Valley (Portadown Road) industrial estates; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other <b>industrial</b> <b>estates</b> in the Craigavon Borough.|$|E

5|$|Yeovil's {{reputation}} as a centre of the aircraft and defence industries lived on into the 21st century despite attempts at diversification, {{and the creation of}} numerous <b>industrial</b> <b>estates,</b> the principal employer is the aviation group AgustaWestland. This firm was created through the acquisition of Westland Helicopters by Finmeccanica in 2000. In January 1986 the proposed sale of Westland to the American Sikorsky Aircraft group led to the Westland affair, a crisis in the Thatcher government, the resignation of Michael Heseltine as Secretary of State for Defence and the resignation two weeks later of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Leon Brittan, after his admission of leaking of a governmental law officer's letter which harshly criticised Mr Heseltine.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, the {{population}} of Dorchester was 19,060, with further people coming from surrounding areas {{to work in the}} town which has six <b>industrial</b> <b>estates.</b> The Brewery Square redevelopment project is taking place in phases, with other development projects planned. The town has a land-based college, Kingston Maurward College, the Thomas Hardye Upper School, three middle schools and thirteen first schools. The Dorset County Hospital offers an accident and emergency service, and the town is served by two railway stations. Through vehicular traffic is routed round the town by means of a bypass. The town has a football club and a rugby union club, several museums and the biannual Dorchester Festival. It is twinned with three towns in Europe. As well as having many listed buildings, a number of notable people have been associated with the town. It was for many years the home and inspiration of the author Thomas Hardy, whose novel The Mayor of Casterbridge uses a fictionalised version of Dorchester as its setting.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in <b>industrial</b> <b>estates</b> on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} various {{industrial}} centres located around the main Braintree town area, including the Springwood <b>Industrial</b> <b>Estate,</b> Park Drive <b>Industrial</b> <b>Estate</b> and Broomhills <b>Industrial</b> <b>Estate</b> off Pod's Brook Lane.

5|$|Poole's {{economy is}} more {{balanced}} {{than the rest}} of Dorset. In the 1960s prosperity was fuelled by growth in the manufacturing sector, whereas the 1980s and 1990s saw expansion in the service sector as office based employers relocated to the area. The importance of manufacturing has declined since the 1960s but still employed approximately 17% of the workforce in 2002 and remains more prominent than in the economy of Great Britain as a whole. Sunseeker, the world's largest privately owned builder of motor yachts and the UK's largest manufacturer, is based in Poole and employs over 1,800 people in its Poole shipyards. Other major employers in the local manufacturing industry include Faerch Plast, Hamworthy Heating, Hamworthy Combustion, Lush, Mathmos, Kerry Foods, Transmission Developments, Eurac, Siemens, Southernprint and Ryvita. Poole has the largest number of <b>industrial</b> <b>estates</b> in South East Dorset, including the Nuffield Industrial estate, Mannings Heath, Arena Business Park, Poole Trade Park and the Branksome Business Centre.|$|E
5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. <b>Industrial</b> <b>estates</b> were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru continued as the state capital and more development was carried out, with the town's expansion and the construction of more new townships and <b>industrial</b> <b>estates.</b> The Indonesian confrontation did not directly affect Johor Bahru as the main Indonesian landing point in Johor was in Labis. There is only one active Indonesian spy organisation in the town, known as Gerakan Ekonomi Melayu Indonesia (GEMI). They frequently engaged with the Indonesian communities living there to contribute information for Indonesian commandos until the bombing of the MacDonald House in Singapore in 1965. By the early 1990s, the town had considerably expanded in size, and was officially granted a city status on 1 January 1994. Johor Bahru City Council was formed and the city's current main square, Dataran Bandaraya Johor Bahru, was constructed to commemorate the event. A central business district was developed in the centre of the city from the mid-1990s in the area around Wong Ah Fook Street. The state and federal government channelled considerable funds {{for the development of the}} city—particularly more so after 2006, when the Iskandar Malaysia was formed.|$|E
