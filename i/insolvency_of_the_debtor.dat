The thesis {{is not limited to}} a description of these procedural peculiarities, but also discusses their impact on the matrimonial property. The author addresses above all a debt discharge and a bankruptcy, for these are the most frequent mechanisms to resolve an <b>insolvency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> On the contrary the author does not address the reorganization, for it is not very frequently used in practise. Furthermore, the author does not address a position of legal persons in insolvency proceedings, since it is not of any importance for this thesis. The author only describes the current legislation as it is. The author therefore neither discusses legislation and court rulings prior the 2013 insolvency act revision, nor considers the revision of the insolvency law that is currently (2017) under way. The thesis is divided into four chapters. In the first chapter, the author briefly discusses matrimonial property law, since it is essential in order to understand legal arguments in the third and fourth chapter of this thesis.

The debt relief was alongside with the reorganization incorporated to the Czech legal system by the Insolvency act, No. 182 / 2006 Coll., which entered into force on the 1 st of January 2008. This led to a significant shift from the liquidation form of resolving bankruptcy to the preference of the remedial methods.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} takeovers in the Czech {{environment}} {{according to the}} Insolvency Act No. 182 / 2006 Coll., which passed {{an amendment to the}} 1. 1. 2008.

Work distinguishes friendly and hostile takeover. The theoretical part provides an overview of possible ways of takeover, the reasons that motivate new owners to think about a possible takeover and globally applicable defense strategies. Another theoretical starting point is consideration of the reorganization of the company, which may be conducted by both the debtor and of the creditor(s). The practical part describes the hostile takeover of SAZKA from its history, through description of the key moments of crisis to insolvency proceedings which resulted in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Subsequent hostile takeover was directed by PPF and KKCG, which bought up commitment wagers and therefore became important creditors (controlling the betting and lottery activities) and later winner of the tender for the sale of the entire company. This case is a textbook example of takeover of the company, which had fallen into financial distress. The battle for the largest lottery company in the country was very hard, long and eventually resulted in a very profitable business, which fell into the arms of a single owner...|$|E

Understanding the functioning of the financial system, the specific financial mechanisms through which savings are allocated to support capital investments and the costs and risks involved is essential {{for the development of a}} solid base for business. In this context, factoring operations can support economic agents, allowing a transfer of commercial receivables from their holder to a factor who commits to their recovery and guarantee such operations even if temporary or permanent <b>insolvency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> Thus, factoring is a complex technique in at least two aspects, of the debt and the transfer of credit..

40|$|Bankruptcy is {{a federal}} court {{procedure}} intended to benefit both debtors and creditors if a debtor is unable to pay all obligations. Filing bankruptcy' stops, or stays, all creditor's debt-collection procedures. The stay is to prevent some creditors from receiving more than their fair share from a financially distressed debtor. A bankruptcy trustee is usually appointed to assist in <b>the</b> fair distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> property. Equitable distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> property also is furthered by the trustee's avoidance powers, <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> exempt property, and the court's discharging <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> from unpaid obligations. There are two basic types of bankruptcy proceedings [...] liquidation and reorganization. Chapter 7 liquidation provides for <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> primary assets, distribution of proceeds to creditors, and discharge of remaining unpaid debts.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) No. 2015 / 848 {{on insolvency proceedings}} (recast) as concerns the coordination among insolvency proceedings. The recast Regulation {{on the one hand}} maintains the general framework of the pre-existing Regulation (EC) No. 1346 / 2000, based on the co-existence of the main insolvency proceedings, to be opened in the Member State where the debtor possesses the centre of his main interests (COMI), and secondary insolvency proceeedings, which may be opened in another Member State where the debtor possesses an establishment, with effects limited to the debtor’s assets present within that Member State. On the other hand, the recast Regulation introduces a series of amendments, inspired to the objective of securing the prevalence of the main insolvency proceeedings. These amndments tend to favour the concentration within the main insolvency proceedings of the whole of the operations inherent in the disposal of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor,</b> so as to reduce as far as possible the need for secondary insolvency proceedings to be opened in another Member State. This aim is concretely pursued by granting extensive powers to the administrator of the main insolvency proceedings, among which, the power of undertaking to apply, as concerns the protection of creditors’ rights in respect of assets located in a Member State where secondary insolvency proceedings could have been opened, the same law as would have applied in case such proceedings were opened (s. c. “synthetic” or “virtual” secondary insolvency proceedings). The recast Regulation contains also express provisions dealing with jurisdiction on actions directly deriving from insolvency proceedings and closely linked with them, favouring their joinder, either before the courts of the Member State competent for the insolvency proceedings as such, or before the courts competent for other actions in civil and commercial matters to which they may be related. The new Regulation refrains instead from regulating the relationships between the insolvency proceedings and pending lawsuits or arbitral proceedings concerning assets of the debtor, which are left for domestic law to regulate, thereby exposing the uniformity in the application of the Regulation to the risk inherent in the differences among Member States’ laws on the subject. Furthermore, reflecting a traditional, strictly inter partes approach, the new Regulation, unlike the Brussels I recast Regulation, falls short of addressing the problems of coordination which might arise with proceedings pending before third country courts...|$|E
