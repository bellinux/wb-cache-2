It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat.

500|$|Elmore James was an American blues slide guitarist {{and singer}} who {{recorded}} from 1951 until 1963. [...] His most famous song, [...] "Dust My Broom", an electrified adaptation of a Robert Johnson tune, {{was his first}} hit and features {{one of the most}} identifiable slide guitar figures in blues. [...] James' composition [...] "The Sky Is Crying" [...] (which became a blues standard) and his rendition of [...] "It <b>Hurts</b> <b>Me</b> Too" [...] were among his most successful singles on the record charts. [...] Other popular James' songs, such as [...] "I Can't Hold Out", [...] ""Madison Blues", [...] "Shake Your Moneymaker", [...] "Bleeding Heart", and [...] "One Way Out", have been recorded by several other artists, including Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, and the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E

[...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it <b>hurts</b> <b>me.</b> It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E

500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it <b>hurts</b> <b>me.</b> It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E
500|$|Following the good-time fun of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35", the Chicago blues-influenced [...] "Pledging My Time" [...] {{sets the}} somber tone {{that runs through}} the album. It draws on several {{traditional}} blues songs, including Elmore James' recording of [...] "It <b>Hurts</b> <b>Me</b> Too". For critic Michael Gray, the lines [...] "Somebody got lucky but it was an accident" [...] echo the lines [...] "Some joker got lucky, stole her back again" [...] from Robert Johnson's [...] "Come On in My Kitchen", which is itself an echo of the Skip James 1931 recording [...] "Devil Got My Woman". Gray suggests that [...] "the gulping movements of the melodic phrases" [...] derive from the melody of [...] "Sitting on Top of the World", recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. The couplet {{at the end of each}} verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she [...] "will come through, too". Besides Dylan's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Hargus [...] "Pig" [...] Robbins's blues piano and Ken Buttrey's snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] in March.|$|E

Peniston said [...] "At that time I was young and still pretty new to the industry myself, and so I hadn't learned how to balance everything just yet.

2500|$|Shortly after declaring {{itself a}} nuclear weapons state, Pakistan had been humiliated diplomatically and militarily. Faced with the {{possibility}} of international isolation, the already fragile Pakistan economy was weakened further. The morale of Pakistan forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties. The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers, an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas. Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation. Responding to this, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said, [...] "It <b>hurts</b> <b>me</b> when an ex-premier undermines his own forces", and claimed that Indian casualties were more than that of Pakistan. The legacy of Kargil war still continues to be debated on Pakistan's news channels and television political correspondents, which Musharraf repeatedly appeared to justified the causes and preludes of the Kargil war.|$|E
2500|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{influential}} electric blues slide guitarist of his era was Elmore James, who gained prominence with a his 1951 song [...] "Dust My Broom", a remake of Robert Johnson's 1936 song, [...] "I Believe I'll Dust My Broom". It features James' playing a series of triplets throughout the song which Rolling Stone magazine called [...] "one immortal lick" [...] and is heard in many blues songs to this day. Although Johnson had used the figure on several songs, James' overdriven electric sound made it [...] "more insistent, firing out a machine-gun triplet beat that would become a defining sound of the early rockers", according to historian Ted Gioia. [...] Unlike Nighthawk and Hooker, James' used a full-chord glissando effect with an open E tuning and a bottleneck. [...] Other popular songs by James, such as [...] "It <b>Hurts</b> <b>Me</b> Too" [...] (first recorded by Tampa Red), [...] "The Sky Is Crying", [...] "Shake Your Moneymaker", feature his slide playing.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never have I been asked to make an announcement that <b>hurts</b> <b>me</b> as much as this one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she <b>hurts</b> <b>me</b> still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it <b>hurts</b> <b>me</b> to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E
