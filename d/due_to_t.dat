500|$|The soundtrack {{and musical}} score for Uyarndha Manithan were {{composed}} by M. S. Viswanathan, while the lyrics {{were written by}} Vaali. The soundtrack was released under the label of Saregama. Vaali worked on the film alongside Adimaippen (1969) and felt that working on two films simultaneously was [...] "torrid". In the composition and picturisation for the song [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam", Viswanathan was inspired {{by one of the}} songs in My Fair Lady (1964), in which Rex Harrison sings with a walking stick in hand on a golf course. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>T.</b> M. Soundararajan's laughter being inadequate during the recording of this song, Viswanathan himself recorded his own laughter. M. Saravanan, in his book AVM 60 Cinema, described the use of dialogues in [...] "Andha Naal Gnaabagam" [...] as [...] "something new to Tamil cinema". The song was parodied by Vikram and Vivek in Dhool (2003), and [...] "Paal Polave" [...] was parodied by Santhanam in Yuvan Yuvathi (2011).|$|E
