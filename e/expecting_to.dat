30|$|This {{model is}} {{estimated}} using OLS regression analysis. A higher GDP and population in country j were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{lead to greater}} demand and, consequently. to higher passenger car exports from country i to country j. A higher GDP and population in country i were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> increase the production capacity. Similarly, a higher quality of logistics in the importing country can also be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be positively related to trade volumes. With respect to the dummy variables, the adjacency of trading nations, a common language, membership of the EEA and {{direct access to the}} sea would all also be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> facilitate trade. Hence, the variables GDPj; POPj; GDPCAPj; LOGISj; CAij; LCij; EEAj and SEAj were all <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be positively correlated to export quantities. On the other hand, increasing physical distance between trade partners, as well as higher tariffs, were both <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have a depressing effect on trade quantities. Hence, the variables Dij and Tariffij were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be negatively correlated to trade volumes.|$|R

5|$|Germany has an {{installed}} capacity {{of wind and}} solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012. A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electric power storage, instead of <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> use their neighbors for net metering.|$|E
