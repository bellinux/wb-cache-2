He then smashes <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> a coffee table and says [...] "It ain't easy, being Cheesy."

500|$|After a trial, Bonass {{signed on}} a free {{transfer}} for Hartlepools United as replacement for winger Ralph Pedwell {{who had left}} the club. The 1934â€“35 Football League campaign began with a visit to Walsall. After two minutes of the match, the home goalkeeper [...] "failed {{to deal with a}} centre by [...] Hird, and Bonass dashed in and headed the ball out of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the net". He continued as both regular selection and regular scorer, with 23 goals from 43 matches in all competitions in his first season. His opening goal in the FA Cup first-round replay against Halifax Town created such excitement among the spectators that they broke through the barriers separating terraces from pitch.|$|E
500|$|Ancient Greeks {{typically}} attributed remarkable deaths to famous {{persons in}} keeping with their characters. [...] The date of Milo's death is unknown, but according to Strabo (VI, 1, 12) and Pausanias (VI, 14, 8), Milo was walking in a forest when he came upon a tree-trunk split with wedges. [...] In what was probably intended as a display of strength, Milo inserted <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the cleft to rend the tree. [...] The wedges fell from the cleft, and the tree closed upon his hands, trapping him. Unable to free himself, the wrestler was devoured by wolves. [...] A modern historian has suggested {{it is more likely}} that Milo was traveling alone when attacked by wolves. [...] Unable to escape, he was devoured and his remains found at the foot of a tree.|$|E

2500|$|In men's fashion, {{the long}} {{redingote}} {{of the era}} of Louis-Philippe (the name came from the English term [...] "riding-coat") was gradually replaced by the jacquette, and then the even shorter veston. [...] The shorter jacket allowed a man to put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> his pockets. [...] The trousers were wide at the waist, and very narrow at the cuffs. Men wore a neutral-colored vest, usually cut low to show off highly decorated shirts with frills and buttons of paste jewellery. [...] Men had gloves, but carried them in their hands, according to Gaston Jolivet, a prominent fashion observer of the time, in order [...] "to prove to the population {{that they had the}} means to buy a pair of gloves without using them." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{escaping}} Hell {{and returning}} to the earthly realm, {{not only do they}} regain a corporeal body with which to interact with the living world once again, but sometimes also exhibit supernatural powers that often reflect the nature of their crimes or punishments. For example, an arsonist imprisoned in Hell for 50 years being tortured by being burnt every day came back with pyrokinetic powers and could take on the appearance of a humanoid creature made of molten rock. Leon Czolgosz, the assassin of William McKinley, gained the ability to turn <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> guns. Not all souls come back to Earth with a corporeal body, as seen in [...] "Ashes to Ashes," [...] where the Mortician soul came back as a spirit since his body was cremated.|$|E
2500|$|The second mate's is proverbially a dog's berth. [...] He {{is neither}} officer nor man. [...] The {{men do not}} respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the [...] topsails, and to put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the tar and slush, with the rest. [...] The crew call him the [...] "sailor's waiter," [...] as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn, marline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which {{includes}} serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. [...] He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged {{to work with the}} crew. [...] He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. [...] His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah (Yoma 39a) {{follows the}} Hebrew Bible text; two goats were procured, similar {{in respect of}} appearance, height, cost, and time of selection. Having one of these on his right {{and the other on}} his left, the high priest, who was {{assisted}} in this rite by two subordinates, put both <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> a wooden case, and took out two labels, one inscribed [...] "for Yahweh" [...] and the other [...] "for Azazel". The high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said, [...] "A sin-offering to Yahweh" [...] (thus speaking the Tetragrammaton); and the two men accompanying him replied, [...] "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever." [...] He then fastened a scarlet woolen thread {{to the head of the}} goat [...] "for Azazel"; and laying his hands upon it again, recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness: [...] "O Lord, I have acted iniquitously, trespassed, sinned before Thee: I, my household, and the sons of Aaron Thy holy ones. O Lord, forgive the iniquities, transgressions, and sins that I, my household, and Aaron's children, Thy holy people, committed before Thee, as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, 'for on this day He will forgive you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord; ye shall be clean.'" ...|$|E
