40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the impact pike fishing season (before spawning in fall (group A) and after spawning in spring (group B)) had on the slaughter yield and fillet fatty acid profile. The slaughter yield of fillets with skin and skinned fillets from the group B fish was significantly lower (by approximately 7. 5 % of body weight). The fatty acid profile of the fish meat from the groups examined differed significantly. The fillets of pike caught before spawning were dominated by unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), while those from fish caught after <b>spawning</b> <b>had</b> mainly saturated fatty acids (SFA). The share of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the fillets of fish that <b>had</b> <b>spawned</b> was sixfold lower, and the n- 3 PUFA differences were nearly ninefold. The content of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids in fillets of fish that <b>had</b> <b>spawned</b> was ninefold lower than in those that had not yet done so. Consequently, the ratio of n- 3 PUFA/n- 6 PUFA in pike from group A was over three times higher than that in the fish that <b>had</b> <b>spawned</b> (2. 61 vs 0. 82). Fillets from pike that <b>have</b> <b>spawned</b> are a significantly poorer source of valuable fatty acids for consumers...|$|R

5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass {{location}}, which in turn varies with the amount and location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers.
