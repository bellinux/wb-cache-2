2500|$|Improvement {{beyond this}} {{standard}} while still using standard [...]338 Lapua Magnum brass is possible, but the bullets {{have to be}} very long (over 5.5 calibers in length) and the normal cartridge overall length of 93.5mm has to be exceeded making such cartridges wildcats. The common 254mm (1:10inch) rifling twist rate also has to be tightened to stabilize very long projectiles. Such commercially non-existent cartridges are termed [...] "wildcats". The use of a wildcat [...]338 Lapua Magnum based cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and fast-twist bore. The <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> and if a repeating arm is required the magazine(s) must also be able to cope with dimensional increases.|$|E
5000|$|The term blueprinting, {{borrowed}} from high performance engine builders, is also often {{applied to the}} process of manufacturing or altering parts to have a desired (usually tighter) clearance than stock parts, and tightening the tolerances on critical dimensions to reduce clearance variations. Blueprinting a <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> involves similar operations designed to tighten the clearances of a <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> to ensure consistent and correct seating of the cartridge in the chamber. A typical set of blueprinting operations for a bolt-action firearm would include the following: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{breechblock}} (or breech block) is {{the part}} of the <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> that closes the breech of a weapon (whether small arms or artillery) at the moment of firing.|$|E
5000|$|Werkzeugpatrone s.S. ("tool{{cartridge}} s.S.") {{with the}} same weight as a s.S. ball cartridge for examining the functioning of a <b>firearms</b> <b>action.</b> A horizontal ring of small holes above the extractor grooves differentiated the Werkzeug round from the s.S. ball cartridge.|$|R
50|$|This firearm {{condition}} {{system can}} also be used to refer to other <b>firearm</b> <b>actions,</b> particularly when illustrating the differences between carry modes considered to be safe for various actions. For example, a double-action/single-action firearm is designed to be carried in Condition 2, which is not safe for 1911s without a firing-pin safety catch.|$|R
50|$|For {{military}} applications, blanks {{are typically}} {{used with a}} special blank-firing adaptor in the firearm that constricts the barrel, keeping chamber pressures from the blank high enough and for long enough of a duration to cycle the <b>firearm's</b> <b>action.</b> In the case of non-crimped blanks, it also serves to pulverise the plug to prevent it leaving as a projectile.|$|R
50|$|A falling-block action (also {{known as}} a sliding-block or dropping-block action) is a single-shot <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> in which a solid metal {{breechblock}} slides vertically in grooves cut into the breech of the weapon and is actuated by a lever.|$|E
50|$|A falling-block action (also {{known as}} a sliding-block action) is a single-shot <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> in which a solid metal {{breechblock}} slides vertically in grooves cut into the breech of the weapon and actuated by a lever. Examples of firearms using the falling block action are the Sharps rifle and Ruger No. 1.|$|E
50|$|Manual {{operation}} is a firearms term describing {{any type of}} <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> that is loaded one shot at a time by the user rather than automatically. For example, break action {{is a form of}} manual operation using a simple hinge mechanism that is manually unlatched by the operator, exposing the chamber(s) for reloading.|$|E
50|$|A {{single shot}} firearm {{can only be}} fired once per {{equipped}} barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the <b>firearm's</b> <b>action</b> must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Locked breech is a {{firearms}} {{term used}} to describe the design of a breech reloading <b>firearm's</b> <b>action.</b> The term is important in understanding how a self reloading firearm works. In the simplest terms, it's one way to slow down the opening of the breech of a self-reloading firearm when fired. The source of power for the movement is recoil (see below) ...|$|R
50|$|Hang fire also termed as Misfire {{refers to}} an {{unexpected}} delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the propellant. This failure was common in <b>firearm</b> <b>actions</b> that relied on open primer pans, due to the poor or inconsistent quality of the powder. Modern firearms are susceptible also. The delay is typically too brief to be noticed, but can be several seconds.|$|R
50|$|In 1870 a Lt. D. H. Friberg of the Swedish army {{patented}} a {{fully automatic}} recoil-operated <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> {{and may have}} produced firing prototypes of a derived design around 1882: this was the forerunner to the 1907 Kjellman machine gun, though due to rapid residue buildup {{from the use of}} black powder Friberg's design was not a practical weapon.|$|E
50|$|Bolt thrust or breech {{pressure}} {{is a term}} used in internal ballistics and firearms (whether small arms or artillery) that describes the amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.|$|E
50|$|The Dardick {{firearms}} {{were basically}} revolvers whose unique open chambers could be reloaded from a magazine. The operating principle used {{was the same}} as a double-action revolver, with a long trigger pull serving to rotate the cylinder, cock, and release the hammer. Since the commercial trounds had the same exterior dimensions, the same <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> would, by using a different barrel, chamber any of the calibers the trounds were chambered in.|$|E
50|$|The break open {{action is}} one of the most compact <b>firearms</b> <b>actions.</b> Since there are no parts to reciprocate, it is shorter than repeating designs, and {{generally}} more compact than non-repeating firearms such as the falling block and rolling block actions. This compactness results in reductions in weight and size compared to larger actions; this can also allow a longer barrel in a firearm of similar size.|$|R
5000|$|However, by the 1980s, {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in safari hunting created a demand for big-bore dangerous-game cartridges. In 1988 Remington {{stepped up to the plate}} with their iteration of the [...]416 Hoffman, which was given the name [...]416 Remington Magnum. Unlike the Rigby, the Remington cartridge utilized the [...]375 H&H Magnum case and therefore, unlike the [...]416 Rigby, could be chambered in most <b>firearm</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shotshells {{will not}} feed {{reliably}} in some magazine fed firearms, {{due to the}} unusual shape of some cartridges that are crimped closed at the case mouth, and the relatively fragile plastic tips of other designs. Shotshells will also not produce sufficient power to cycle semiautomatic actions, because, unlike projectile ammunition, nothing forms to the lands and grooves of the barrel to create the pressure necessary to cycle the <b>firearm's</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although both [...] "semi automatic" [...] and [...] "fully automatic" [...] {{firearms}} are [...] "automatic" [...] in {{the technical}} sense that the firearm automatically cycles between rounds with each trigger pull, the terms [...] "automatic weapon" [...] and [...] "automatic firearm" [...] are conventionally reserved by firearm enthusiasts to describe fully automatic firearms. Use of this convention can avoid confusion. Firearms are further defined {{by the type of}} <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> used.|$|E
50|$|A rolling block {{action is}} a form of <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> where the sealing of the breech is done with a {{specially}} shaped breechblock able to rotate on a pin. The breechblock is shaped like a section of a circle.The breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{purposes}} of the <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> are holding the cartridge {{in place in the}} chamber, and providing a way to ignite the propellant. In a single-shot action, little additional functionality is provided, while in a semi-automatic firearm the action also taps energy from the firing process for cycling to fire the next round. From an accuracy perspective, the primary goal of the action is to achieve a consistent placement of the cartridge in the chamber every shot.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} <b>firearm</b> <b>actions,</b> the break-action design {{does not require}} the barrels to be {{specially}} fitted to an individual action. Any barrel, {{with the exception of a}} Herrett barrel, that is made for a Contender will fit onto any frame, allowing the shooter to purchase additional barrels in different calibers for a fraction of the cost of a complete firearm. Since the sights are mounted on the barrel, they remain sighted-in and zeroed between barrel changes.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{there is}} a minimum {{momentum}} required to operate a recoil-operated <b>firearm's</b> <b>action,</b> the cartridge must generate sufficient recoil to provide that momentum. Therefore, recoil-operated firearms work best with a cartridge that yields a momentum approximately equal to that for which the mechanism was optimized. For example, the M1911 design with factory springs is optimized for a [...] bullet at factory velocity. Changes in caliber or drastic changes in bullet weight and/or velocity require modifications to spring weight or slide mass to compensate.|$|R
5000|$|Renaud Kerbrat has {{designed}} {{a number of}} <b>firearm</b> <b>actions</b> claimed to eliminate most of the weapon's muzzle jump and recoil, thus making them more controllable during automatic fire. Kerbrat’s work as a small arms designer has resulted in several patents being granted by the US Patent Office. The TDI Vector submachine gun family manufactured in the USA are thus far the only production weapons to use Kerbrat's designs; in this case, the so-called [...] "Super V" [...] system, a blowback action using an off-axis recoil track for the block and bolt.|$|R
50|$|The lock of a {{muzzle-loading firearm}} {{is the system}} used to ignite the propellant. Types of lock include matchlock, wheellock, snaplock, snaphance, miquelet lock, doglock, flintlock, modern percussion, closed bolt, open bolt, {{rotating}} bolt, and experimental electronic types. Parts of the lock can include the wheel (for wheellocks) and the hammer and frizzen (for flintlocks). A complete muzzleloader consists of lock, stock, and barrel. In breech-loading weapons, the general mechanism for handling ammunition {{is known as the}} <b>firearm</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The British [...]577 Snider-Enfield was a breech-loading rifle. The American Jacob Snider {{invented the}} <b>firearm</b> <b>action,</b> and the Snider-Enfield {{was one of}} the most widely used of the Snider varieties. The British Army adopted it in 1866 as a {{conversion}} system for its ubiquitous Pattern 1853 Enfield muzzle-loading rifles, and used it until 1874 when the Martini-Henry rifle began to supersede it. The British Indian Army used the Snider-Enfield until the end of the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|The Peabody {{action was}} an early form of breechloading <b>firearm</b> <b>action,</b> where the heavy {{breechblock}} tilted downwards across a bolt mounted {{in the rear of}} the breechblock, operated by a lever under the rifle. The Peabody action most often used an external hammer to fire the cartridge.The Peabody action was developed by Henry O. Peabody from Boston, Massachusetts, and was first patented on July 22, 1862. While the Peabody was not perfected in time for the American Civil War, a few were entered in the trials of 1864 with favorable reports.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the text}} are {{one or more}} stills showing the <b>firearm</b> in <b>action</b> /and/or which {{characters}} used it. The photos will often show original forms of the firearm along with variant versions.|$|R
50|$|A blank {{is a type}} of {{cartridge}} for {{a firearm}} that contains gunpowder but no bullet or shot. Blanks use paper or plastic wadding to seal gunpowder into the cartridge. When fired, the blank makes a flash and an explosive sound (report), the wadding is propelled from the barrel of the gun, and the <b>firearm's</b> <b>action</b> cycles. Blanks are often used for simulation (such as in historical reenactments, theatre and movie special effects), training, for signaling (see starting pistol), and cowboy mounted shooting. Blank cartridges differ from dummy cartridges, which are used for training or function testing firearms; these contain no primer or gunpowder, and are inert.|$|R
50|$|Many {{caseless}} cartridges {{are also}} telescoped, with {{the bulk of}} the bullet held within the body of the cartridge, to cut down on cartridge length. A shorter cartridge cuts down on the distance the <b>firearm's</b> <b>action</b> must reciprocate to load a new round, which allows for higher cyclic rates and greater probability of multiple hits on a target at long range. Lack of a case also reduces the weight of the cartridge substantially, especially in small bore rifles. For example, the caseless ammunition designed by Austrian inventor Hubert Usel (1926—2010) for the Voere VEC-91 weighs about one third as much as regular ammunition for the same caliber.|$|R
50|$|Recoil {{operation}} {{is a type}} of locked-breech <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> used in semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms. It also uses energy from the combustion in the chamber acting directly on the bolt through the cartridge head, but in this case the firearm has a reciprocating barrel and breach assembly, combined with a bolt that locks to the breach. The breach remains locked as the bolt and barrel travel rearward together for some distance, allowing pressure in the chamber to drop to a safe level before the breech is opened.|$|E
5000|$|Break {{action is}} a type of <b>firearm</b> <b>action</b> in which the barrel or barrels are hinged much like a door and rotate perpendicularly to the bore axis to expose the breech and allow loading and {{unloading}} of cartridges. A separate operation may be required for the cocking of a hammer to fire the new round. There are many types of break-action firearms; break actions are universal in double-barrelled shotguns, double rifles and combination guns, and are also common in single shot rifles, pistols (especially derringers), and shotguns, and can also be found in flare guns, grenade launchers, air guns and some older revolver designs. They are also known as hinge-action, break-open, break-barrel, break-top, or (on old revolvers) top-break actions.|$|E

5000|$|The FAMAS assault rifle, a French-made {{automatic}} bullpup-style rifle, chambered in the 5.56×45mm NATO round. In bullpup-style <b>firearms,</b> the <b>action</b> {{and magazine}} insert {{is behind the}} trigger section. This layout shortens {{the length of the}} weapon, while retaining the barrel length.|$|R
50|$|Out-of-battery {{refers to}} the status of a <b>firearm</b> before the <b>action</b> has {{returned}} to the normal firing position.|$|R
50|$|With a pump-action <b>firearm,</b> the <b>action</b> is {{operated}} by a movable fore-end that goes backwards and forwards to eject, extract, and chamber a round of ammunition. Pump-actions are usually associated with shotguns, but {{one example of a}} pump-action rifle is the Remington Model 7600 series.|$|R
