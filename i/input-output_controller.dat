40|$|The {{trade off}} between model {{accuracy}} and computation tractability for model-based control applications is well known. While nonlinear models {{are needed to}} capture the detailed behavior of many chemical processes, the resultant structures may not lead to straightforward control implementation. The current work advocates the use of low order nonlinear models based on wave propagation which are mathematically concise and also capture the essential nonlinear behavior of a process. A low order model developed for a high-purity distillation column using the traveling wave phenomenon captures the inherent dynamics of the column. Differential geometry is invoked to achieve input-output linearization of the distillation column based on the nonlinear wave model. A Kalman filter is used to recursively update the parameter values. Comparison with a linear controller based on a two-time constant model is presented. The nonlinear controller outperforms the linear controller in tight control of both the overhead and the bottoms composition. ^ An extension of the traveling wave theory is used to develop a low order model for a batch reactive distillation column. The formation of traveling waves is qualitatively captured by the reduced model. The reduced model is used in nonlinear model predictive control algorithm to produce a specified amount of distillate. The purity of the distillate obtained is controlled via constraints on the tray temperatures in the nonlinear optimization program. The use of reduced model results in significant reduction in the computational requirements. ^ Since most models do not capture {{the entire range of}} behavior exhibited by a chemical process, it is necessary to study the impact of plant-model mismatch. As input-output linearization is used to decouple and control an ill-conditioned process such as the binary distillation column in our work, the impact of uncertainty on the input-output linearization controller performance is studied.

40|$|Abstract Stability of a {{fuzzy control}} system {{is closely related}} to the {{analytical}} structure of the fuzzy controller, which is determined by its components such as input and output fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. We first characterize the mathematical input–output structure of fuzzy controllers and then utilize the structure charac-teristics to advance stability analysis. We study how the components of a general class of Mamdani fuzzy controllers dictate the <b>controller’s</b> <b>input–output</b> relation-ship. The <b>controllers</b> can use input fuzzy sets of any types, arbitrary fuzzy rules, arbitrary inference methods, either Zadeh or the product fuzzy logic AND oper-ator, singleton output fuzzy sets, and the centroid defuzzifier. We theoretically prove that regardless of the choices for the other components, if and only if Zadeh fuzzy AND operator and piecewise linear (e. g., trapezoidal or triangular) input fuzzy sets are used, the fuzzy controllers become a peculiar class of nonlinear controllers with the following interesting characteristics: (1) they are linear with respect to input variables; (2) their control gains dynamically change with the input variables; and (3) they become linear controllers with constant gains around the system equilibrium point. These properties make the fuzzy controllers suitable for analysis and design using conventional control theory. This necessary and sufficient condition becomes a sufficient condition if the product AND operator is employed instead. We name the fuzzy controllers of this peculiar class type-A fuzzy controllers. Taking advantage of this new structure knowledge, we have established a necessary and sufficient local stability condition for the type-A fuzzy control systems. It can be used not only for the stability determination, but also fo...|$|R

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organised}} as follows. Section 2 describes {{the set of}} differential equations which compound the SEIR model for the propagation of an epidemic disease through a host population. A result related to the positivity property of such a model is proven. Section 3 presents a control action based on an input-output linearization technique, guaranteeing the positivity and stability properties of the system while asymptotically achieving the eradication of the infection from the host population and, simultaneously, the whole population becoming immune. The positivity property is required from the own nature of the system which forbids the existence of negative populations at any time instant. The control strategy requires {{the knowledge of the}} susceptible, infected, infectious and whole population for all time. In this context, the knowledge of the infectious and whole population for all time is feasible, but the knowledge of the susceptible and infected population for all time is not a realistic assumption. As a consequence, such partial populations have to be estimated by means of an observer dynamic system. Then a control action based on such estimates, instead of the corresponding true partial populations, is carried out in Section 4. These theoretical results and the effectiveness of the feedback <b>input-output</b> linearizing <b>controller</b> combined with the observer are illustrated by means of some simulation results in Section 5.|$|R

A dynamic model of the autonomous vehicle is required for such a control approach in order to verify continuously wheel-terrain contact stability. For achieving autonomy, the dynamics based control approach is formulated for a three-wheeled vehicle with front wheel driving and steering. Exact input-output linearization of the vehicle dynamics facilitates the design of the operational space control and permits the enhancement of the autonomy of the vehicle. However, the sufficient smoothness condition for applying feedback linearization has to be continuously observed and this requires the avoidance of actuators torque saturation, wheel-ground longitudinal and lateral slippage and tip-over of the vehicle for motion on horizontal plane as well as inclined surfaces. In this thesis, first is presented a complete three dimensional kinematic and dynamic model of a three-wheeled autonomous vehicle built in our laboratory.
