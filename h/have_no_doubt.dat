5|$|I do not, and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> your Lordships do not, {{have any}} wish {{to expand the}} role of the {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Public Engagement was {{established}} on October 19, 2012, and includes the Rural Secretariat, the Voluntary and Non-Profit Secretariat, the Youth Engagement office, the Strategic Partnership Initiative, and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Office. Innovation, Business and Rural Development Minister Keith Hutchings was appointed as the minister {{responsible for the}} office, while Steve Kent was appointed parliamentary secretary for the office. Several days after his appointment Hutchings announced {{that the government was}} looking at putting restaurant inspection reports online for the public viewing. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had spent $457 obtaining inspection reports earlier the year, which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29. On November 22, 2012, Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government's website and see recent health and sanitation inspection reports for restaurants. While both opposition parties agreed with the government's decision to make the reports available online, Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that this is a response to the Bill 29 criticism".|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E

25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult one. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E

When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and {{immediately}} thou shalt let thyself be baptised.|$|E

25|$|Once accused, Miss Gilchrist {{breaks down}} in a flood of {{complaints}} of the hardships {{of her life and}} fantasies about a new teashop. She goes quietly with Inspector Morton. Thus Poirot answered the question Mr Entwhistle hired him to resolve, and untangled the mystery of Cora's death. Miss Gilchrist is found guilty at trial. In her time in prison during legal proceedings, she is quickly becoming insane, planning one tea shop after another. Mr Entwhistle and Hercule Poirot suspect her punishment might be served in Broadmoor, but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> she had plotted and carried out the cold blooded murder in full possession of her faculties – this ladylike murderer.|$|E
25|$|Since the Industrial Revolution {{some two}} hundred years ago, the food {{processing}} industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.|$|E
25|$|We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> {{that if the}} Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense {{against its}} laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., {{it would be the}} duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; {{it is a question of}} fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E

25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass {{over his shoulder to}} Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
25|$|John Duff {{was born}} in China in 1895. Like {{everyone}} else in the British Empire, Canadians were subjects of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff {{can be found on the}} Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for “Nationality”. In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that their father was a Canadian.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' {{must therefore be}} something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded {{as a human being}} in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - {{it seems to me that}} the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E
