40|$|The {{community}} of scholarship between agriculture and <b>education</b> is <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> The <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> discipline contributes to agricultural and educational systems by linking the technical areas {{of agriculture and}} the humanistic dimensions (Barrick, 1988). It is hard to appraise {{the impact of the}} discipline called <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> It is also difficult to see the future potential of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> It is great when students and visitors from other countries ask questions about the success of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in the United States. Likewise, it is rewarding when people from other disciplines ask for <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> expertise with a new initiative. These people see the contributions that <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> has made and/or can make in agricultural and educational development. The 1985 approval of an “Advisory Committee ” for <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> research by the North Central Regional Association of State Agricultural Experiment Station Directors expanded the acceptance of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> as a discipline (NCA- 24 Committee, 1987).

In response, numerous studies have been conducted in recent years throughout the United States regarding how secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs are perceived by school leaders. For the first time, this study sought to shed light on how secondary principals in Kentucky perceived <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs. Considered in this study, were how secondary principals with <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools perceived those programs differently than secondary principals without <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools. Secondary principals in Kentucky were selected to participate in this study based on the population of Kentucky counties that had at least one secondary school with <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> and at least one secondary school without <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> (N = 95). This quantitative descriptive study measured how participants perceived secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs by utilizing a survey with Likert-type and demographic questions. Four constructs guided the survey items to measure how secondary principals perceived <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> based upon overall program success, the courses offered in <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs, the quality of agriculture teachers, and personal familiarity with the FFA. Results indicated that secondary principals with <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools have significantly higher perceptions of such programs than do secondary principals without <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools. Furthermore, results revealed that all constructs included in this study have predictive variables of one’s overall perception of secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs. Additional research is necessary to further examine how secondary principals nationwide perceive <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs and to what extent their perceptions are valued regarding decision making for program implementation...|$|R

First the agri-food complex is described briefly, to give some contextual information about <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> Additionally, some factual information about <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> itself is given. Subsequently, the trend towards green education is described, followed by a description and discussion of the first Policy Letter of the Ministry of Agriculture on the future of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> Then, the second Policy Letter is presented, including the shift towards content innovation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> and the implications for a general green curriculum.

Jailed (1984) reported that legislators must become more familiar with vocational education as they address {{the economic and social}} needs of the future. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the perceptions held by Iowa and Nebraska Legislators regarding secondary and adult <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs conducted within the public school system. The population for this study consisted of state legislators in Iowa and Nebraska. Seventy legislators, thirty-five from each state, were randomly selected for the study. Legislators were mailed a survey containing twenty-two attitudinal statements relating to <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> Legislators were asked to rate -the importance of the current situation and future direction of each statement. Comparisons were made between the different demographic groups of legislators. Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s Power Analysis was used to determine meaningful difference at a large effect size. Based on the data gathered, the following results were found. A meaningful difference was not observed between legislators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the current situation and future direction of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> While agriculture and general education issues were perceived as being of relatively high importance in Iowa and Nebraska, <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> was perceived as being of lower importance. Legislators who had ties with agriculture were more supportive of issues relating to <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> The role of the secondary vocational agriculture program was seen as being limited to rural high schools. Legislators seemed not to be familiar with the other aspects of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs. Legislators were not supportive of any changes in the source of funding for educational programs. While they were supportive of the general funding of education, they did not support funding for <b>agricultural</b> <b>education.</b> The above findings indicated that changes in the amount of support from state legislators will not come from within. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> profession must initiate programs to increase legislator’s awareness of the needs and benefits of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education...</b>|$|R

40|$|Changing <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> {{programs}} {{to meet the}} needs of student clientele has been a major focus of the profession in recent years. Program change was a primary emphasis in the report Understanding Agriculture: m Directions for Education (1988) where it was noted that “the focus [...] I of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> must change ” (p. 2). In this report it was advocated that if <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> is going to serve all students the mission should be broadened to include agricultural literacy. Further, it was advocated that major changes are needed in programs of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> to accomplish this task. Prominent changes in <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs have occurred because of funding initiatives. Still other programmatic changes have occurred because of expressed federal concerns, state mandates, and research findings. Berry and Ginsberg (1990) related that educational policy makers now believe that “lasting improvements in teaching will occur only if educational decision making is decentralized and teachers are empowered to use their best professional judgment ” (p. 617 - 618). However, as noted by Hillison and Burke, (1988), the views of practicing teachers are seldom sought to aid in making major decisions which affect programmatic change. It is recognized by the profession that the teacher is the key to a strong viable program of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education...</b>|$|R
