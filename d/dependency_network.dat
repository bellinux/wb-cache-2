Recently <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> {{have also been}} proposed as classification models, but as with e. g. general probabilistic inference, the reported speed-ups are often obtained {{at the expense of}} accuracy. In this paper we try to address this issue through the use of mixtures of <b>dependency</b> <b>networks.</b> To reduce learning time and improve robustness when dealing with data sparse classes, we outline methods for reusing calculations across mixture components. Finally, the proposed model is empirically compared to other state-of-the-art classifiers, both in terms of accuracy and learning time. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Dependency</b> <b>networks</b> {{approximate}} a {{joint probability}} distribution over multiple random variables {{as a product}} of conditional distributions. Relational <b>Dependency</b> <b>Networks</b> (RDNs) are graphical models that extend <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> to relational domains. This higher expressivity, however, comes at the expense of a more complex modelselection problem: an unbounded number of relational abstraction levels might need to be explored. Whereas current learning approaches for RDNs learn a single probability tree per random variable, we propose to turn the problem into a series of relational function-approximation problems using gradient-based boosting. In doing so, one can easily induce highly complex features over several iterations and in turn estimate quickly a very expressive model. Our experimental results in several different data sets show that this boosting method results in efficient learning of RDNs when compared to state-of-the-art statistical relational learning approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|Graphical {{models have}} gained {{a lot of}} {{attention}} recently as a tool for learning and representing dependencies among variables in multivariate data. Often, domain scientists are looking specifically for differences among the <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> of different conditions or populations (e. g. differences between regulatory net-works of different species, or differences between <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> of dis-eased versus healthy populations). The standard method for finding these differ-ences is to learn the <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> for each condition independently and compare them. We show that this approach is prone to high false discovery rates (low precision) that can render the analysis useless. We then show that by impos-ing a bias towards learning similar <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> for each condition the false discovery rates can be reduced to acceptable levels, at the cost of finding a reduced number of differences. Algorithms developed in the transfer learning lit-erature can be used to vary the strength of the imposed similarity bias and provide a natural mechanism to smoothly adjust this differential precision-recall tradeoff to cater to the requirements of the analysis conducted. We present real case studies (oncological and neurological) where domain experts use the proposed technique to extract useful differential networks that shed light on the biological processes involved in cancer and brain function. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose using <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> (Heckerman et al., 2000), that is a {{probabilistic}} graphical model similar to Bayesian networks, to model classifiers. The main {{difference between these two}} models is that in <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> cycles are allowed, and this fact has the consequence that the automatic learning process is much easier and can be parallelized. These properties make <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> a valuable model especially when it is needed to deal with large databases. Because of these promising characteristics we analyse the usefulness of dependency networks-based Bayesian classifiers. We present an approach that uses independence tests based on chi square distribution, in order to find relationships between predictive variables. We show that this algorithm is as good as some state-of the-art Bayesian classifiers, like TAN and an implementation of the BAN model, and has, in addition, other interesting proprierties like scalability or good quality for visualizing relationships. ...|$|R

40|$|Scientists {{increasingly}} {{depend on}} {{machine learning algorithms}} to discover patterns in complex data. Two examples addressed in this dissertation are identifying how information sharing among regions of the brain develops due to learning; and, learning <b>dependency</b> <b>networks</b> of blood proteins associated with cancer. <b>Dependency</b> <b>networks,</b> or graphical models, are learned from the observed data {{in order to make}} comparisons between the sub-populations of the dataset. Rarely is there sufficient data to infer robust individual networks for each sub-population. The multiple networks must be considered simultaneously; exploding the hypothesis space of the learning problem. Exploring this complex solution space requires input from the domain scientist to refine the objective function. This dissertation introduces a framework to incorporate domain knowledge in transfer learning to facilitate the exploration of solutions. The framework is a generalization of existing algorithms for multiple network structure identification. Solutions produced with human input narrow down the variance of solutions to those that answer questions of interest to domain scientists. Patterns, such as identifying differences between networks, are learned with higher confidence using transfer learning than through the standard method of bootstrapping. Transfer learning may be the ideal method for making comparisons among <b>dependency</b> <b>networks,</b> whether looking for similarities or differences. Domain knowledge input and visualization of solutions are combined in an interactive tool that enables domain scientists to explore the space of solutions efficiently.

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of social function (i.e.: preserving society's life support structure, and overall structure intact), Mission Critical aspects of social function would necessitate the provision of Basic Needs for society. Such basic needs are often said to include Food (this includes food production and distribution), Water, Clothing (not an immediate need in an Emergency), Sanitation (Sewage is an immediate need, but Physical waste/garbage/rubbish disposal is not an immediate need in an Emergency), Housing/Shelter, Energy (not immediate) and Health Needs (not immediate in a healthy population). The prior list is not exhaustive. Longer term needs might include Communications/Transport needs in a developed population. This list of needs is associated with Mission Critical Personnel in a clear manner - Food Production requires Farmers, Food Distribution requires transportation personnel, Water requires Water-Infrastructure maintenance personnel (a long term requirement IF existing water infrastructure has been maintained to a high standard), Clothing tends to require individuals to maintain Clothes Production infrastructure, similarly for Sanitation. In emergencies, housing/shelter requires someone to build the shelter and maintain it {{over the long term}} if necessary. Health needs are met by Doctors, Nurses and Surgeons. It should be noted that implicit use of infrastructure requires personnel to maintain that infrastructure also - so Food Transportation requires not only that there are drivers for food trucks, but also that (over the long term) there are Highways maintenance personnel who can maintain the roads, traffic infrastructure and signs for the roads, this in turn requires power supply personnel to provide power for traffic lights, etc... In this light, Mission Critical Systems (like other Mission Critical Systems) have a complex <b>Dependency</b> <b>network</b> which enables analysis of the level of interconnected Dependencies between different aspects of a Mission Critical System, which can be useful in planning, or just for gaining a truthful picture of how Mission Criticality is organised in Complex systems. This would enable the determination of 'choke points' in a Complex system, points at which a Mission Critical System (or set of systems) is vulnerable in one sense or another. Ideas that relate to Human resources and Human resources planning (making use of Gantt charts for Project Management, etc...) are also relevant.|$|E
