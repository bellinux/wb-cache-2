5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of <b>intergalactic</b> <b>space</b> is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in <b>intergalactic</b> <b>space</b> is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The Universe is all {{of space}} and time (spacetime) and its contents, which {{includes}} planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of <b>intergalactic</b> <b>space</b> and all matter and energy. While the size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe. Halpern and Tomasello calculated the observable universe using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into <b>intergalactic</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|Two entirely {{different}} suggestions have been advanced {{in the literature}} as to where the cosmic rays originate. The first suggestion is that cosmic rays are of local origin (upper earth atmosphere, our own planetary system, etc.).

40|$|Study of {{the arrival}} {{direction}} distribution {{plays a key}} role in finding sources of the Extremely High Energy Cosmic Rays (EHECR). Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz’min (GZK) mechanism [1, 2] limits the propagation of EHE cosmic rays significantly and only nearby sources can contribute to the local EHECR flux[3 - 6]. Further-more EHECRs travel <b>intergalactic</b> <b>spaces</b> almost linearly. Hence, we expect they can be traced back to their sources. Here we report a small-sacle anisotropy of the arrival direction distribution of EHECRs observed by AGASA above 1019 eV. This result strongly suggests the existence of point sources of EHECRs...|$|R

5|$|Within our Solar System, {{interplanetary space}} {{is filled with}} the plasma {{expelled}} via the solar wind, extending from the Sun's surface out to the heliopause. Furthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or <b>intergalactic</b> <b>space</b> is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densities. Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} {{that exists between}} {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies. Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy. <b>Intergalactic</b> <b>space</b> takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{spectrum}} of the different components in the astrophysical neutrino flux reaching the Earth and the possible contribution of each component to the high-energy IceCube data. We show that the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with gas in our galaxy implies just 2 events among the 54 event sample. We argue that the neutrino flux from cosmic ray interactions in the <b>intergalactic</b> (intracluster) <b>space</b> depends critically on the transport parameter δ describing the energy dependence in the diffusion coefficient of galactic cosmic rays. Our analysis motivates a E^- 2. 1 neutrino spectrum with a drop at PeV energies that fits well the data, including the non-observation of the Glashow resonance at 6. 3 PeV. We also show that a cosmic ray flux described by an unbroken power law may produce a neutrino flux with interesting spectral features (bumps and breaks) related {{to changes in the}} cosmic ray composition.

25|$|Looking {{beyond the}} Milky Way, {{there are at}} least 2 {{trillion}} other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times further than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in <b>space,</b> <b>intergalactic</b> travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years, or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the Alcubierre drive. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that intergalactic travel is impossible in principle.|$|R

40|$|High {{frequency}} peaked high redshift blazars, are extreme in {{the sense}} that their spectrum is particularly hard and peaks at TeV energies. Standard leptonic scenarios require peculiar source parameters and/or a special setup in order to account for these observations. Electromagnetic cascades seeded by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) in the intergalactic medium have also been invoked, assuming a very low intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). Here we study the synchrotron emission of UHECR secondaries produced in blazars located in magnetised environments, and show that it can provide an alternative explanation to these challenged channels, for sources embedded in structured regions with magnetic field strengths of the order of $ 10 ^{- 7 }$ G. To demonstrate this, we focus on three extreme blazars: 1 ES 0229 + 200, RGB J 0710 + 591, and 1 ES 1218 + 304. We model the expected gamma-ray signal from these sources through a combination of numerical Monte Carlo simulations and solving the kinetic equations of the particles in our simulations, and explore the UHECR source and <b>intergalactic</b> medium parameter <b>space</b> to test the robustness of the emission. We show that the generated synchrotron pair halo/echo flux at the peak energy is not sensitive to variations in the overall IGMF strength. This signal is unavoidable in contrast to the inverse Compton pair halo/echo intensity, which is appealing in view of the large uncertainties on the IGMF in voids of large scale structure. It is also shown that the variability of blazar gamma-ray emission can be accommodated by the synchrotron emission of secondary products of UHE neutral beams if these are emitted by UHECR accelerators inside magnetised regions.
