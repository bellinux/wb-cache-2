5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a political national messiah, {{but the evidence}} for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a Galilean Jew, born {{around the}} {{beginning}} of the 1st century, who died in 30 or 33 AD in Judea. The general scholarly consensus is that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a contemporary of John the Baptist and was crucified by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who held office from 26 to 36 AD.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born, and postulates that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E

5000|$|The {{quest for}} the {{historical}} Jesus began {{with the work of}} Hermann Samuel Reimarus in the 18th century. [...] Two books, both called The Life of <b>Jesus</b> <b>were</b> written by David Strauss, published in German in 1835-36, and Ernest Renan, published in French in 1863. The Historical <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> conceptually different than the Christ of Faith. The former is physical, while the latter metaphysical. The Historical <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> based on historical evidence. Every time a new scroll is unearthed or new Gospel fragment is found, the Historical <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> modified. And because so much has been lost, we can never know him completely.|$|R
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E
5|$|Judaism {{rejects the}} belief that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the awaited Messiah, arguing {{that he did not}} fulfill Messianic prophecies and asserting that his resurrection is a Christian legend.|$|E
40|$|In 50 {{different}} {{instances in}} the Gospels and Acts confessions about <b>Jesus</b> <b>are</b> expressed. A synopsis of these confessions indicates that these confessions {{reflect on the}} question about who <b>Jesus</b> really <b>is.</b> Furthermore it is revealed that the contents of these confessions ultimately represent only three basic confessions about Jesus:(1) <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Christ, (2) <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Son of God, and (3) <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Lord. These basic confessions are augmented by three other more detailed confes­sions, in which <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> confessed to be (4) God Himself, (5) our Saviour, and (6) the Judge of {{the living and the}} dead. It is maintained that the Gospels and Acts state that God, through his Spirit and his Word, gave these truths about Jesus to his Church to confess. That these truths are indeed confessed by the Church, is evident from a survey of the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed, as well as the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism and the Canons of Dordt...|$|R

5|$|The ox and the ass, as well {{as other}} animals, became a part of nativity scene tradition. In a 1415, Corpus Christi celebration, the Ordo paginarum notes that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> lying between an ox and an ass. Other animals {{introduced}} to nativity scenes include elephants and camels.|$|E
5|$|To aid in his {{ministry}} to the Jewish people, <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> given {{the ability to}} perform miracles, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through {{his ministry}}, Jesus {{is seen as a}} precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas Iscariot was {{a disciple}} of Jesus. Before the Last Supper, Judas {{went to the}} chief priests and agreed to hand over Jesus in {{exchange}} for 30 silver coins. <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> then arrested in Gethsemane, where Judas revealed Jesus' identity to the soldiers by giving him a kiss.|$|E

Early the next morning, the chief priests and scribes lead Jesus away into their council.

5|$|As the Word, <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
5|$|However, {{throughout}} the history of Christianity a number of relics attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16thcentury Catholic theologian Erasmus wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the cross used in the Crucifixion. Similarly, while experts debate whether <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty holy nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star of Bethlehem {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E
5000|$|The high priest's palace, {{later that}} night. The arresting party brings Jesus to the Sanhedrin (Jewish supreme court); {{according}} to Luke's Gospel, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> beaten by his Jewish guards {{prior to his}} examination; the court examines him, {{in the course of}} which, according to John's Gospel, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> struck in the face by one of the Jewish officials; the court determine he deserves to die (see Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus). According to Matthew's Gospel, the court then [...] "spat in his face and struck him with their fists." [...] They then send him to Pontius Pilate. According to the synoptic gospels, the high priest who examines <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> Caiaphas; in John, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> also interrogated by Annas, Caiaiphas' father-in-law.|$|R
2500|$|Jews for <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> a Messianic Jewish {{non-profit}} organization founded in 1973 {{which seeks to}} share its belief that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the promised Messiah of the Jewish people. [...] They use symbols, holidays, and stories from classic Jewish sources, rebranding them as Christian.|$|R
5000|$|Just as in Romans 10:9-13 Paul {{emphasized}} the salvific value of [...] "professing by mouth" [...] that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> Lord (Kyrion Iesoun), Augustine {{emphasized the}} value of [...] "professing that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Son of God" [...] as a path to salvation.|$|R
5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{soldiers}} {{break the}} two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten {{death in a}} crucifixion), {{but they do not}} break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In , one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and blood and water flow out. In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn. In , an earthquake breaks open tombs. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman centurion states that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the Son of God.|$|E
50|$|After his arrest, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{taken to}} the Sanhedrin, a Jewish {{judicial}} body. The gospel accounts differ {{on the details of}} the trials. In Matthew 26:57, Mark 14:53 and Luke 22:54, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{taken to the}} house of the high priest, Caiaphas, where he is mocked and beaten that night. Early the next morning, the chief priests and scribes lead Jesus away into their council. John 18:12-14 states that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> first taken to Annas, Caiaphas' father-in-law, and then to the high priest.|$|R

5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{the name}} of <b>Jesus</b> in {{petitions}} <b>is</b> stressed in John 16:23 when Jesus states: [...] "If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you." [...] Many Christian prayers thus conclude with the words: [...] "Through Our Lord <b>Jesus</b> Christ". There <b>is</b> widespread belief among Christians that the name <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> not merely a sequence of identifying symbols but includes intrinsic divine power, and that where the name of <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> spoken or displayed the power of <b>Jesus</b> can <b>be</b> called upon.|$|R
5000|$|Unitarian Christology can {{be divided}} {{according}} to whether <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> believed {{to have had a}} pre-human existence.
