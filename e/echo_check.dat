50|$|In {{computer}} telecommunications, echo is {{the display}} or return of sent data at {{or to the}} sending end of a transmission. Echo can be either local echo, where the sending device itself displays the sent data, or remote echo, where the receiving device returns the sent data that it receives to the sender (which is of course simply no local echo {{from the point of}} view of the sending device itself). That latter, when used as a form of error detection to determine that data received at the remote end of a communications line are the same as data sent, is also known as echoplex, <b>echo</b> <b>check,</b> or loop check. When two modems are communicating in echoplex mode, for example, the remote modem echoes whatever it receives from the local modem.|$|E
40|$|This bachelors thesis {{deals with}} the {{screening}} of hearing of newborns in the Hospital of České Budějovice a. s. The results of the screening of hearing of all the children born in the Hospital in České Budějovice from 1. 1. 2007 to 31. 12. 2008 are stated here. The screening was performed by the method of establishment of presence of transiently evoked oto-acoustic emissions by <b>Echo</b> <b>Check</b> and Echo Screen devices. During the examination of newborns, the Hospital of České Budějovice a. s. and the Faculty of Health and Social Studies of the University of South Bohemia co-operated closely. The examined newborns {{were divided into two}} groups. The first of them, physiological newborns (not endangered group) are children, hospitalized at the station of physiological newborns. These children were born without apparent risks and their adaptation after the birth succeeded without complications. The second group, pathological newborns, (endangered group) are children hospitalized in the stations for pathological newborns; each of them has {{at least one of the}} following risks: positive family anamnesis, prenatal infection, weight under 1500 g, perinathal hypoxia, controlled and supporting ventilation, long-term oxygeno-therapy, jaundice VT or limit jaundice, neuro-infection, aminoglykosides, glykopeptides, diuretics, inherent impediments of the head and neck. The target of the thesis was the timely finding of hearing impediments of babies born in the Neo-nathological Department of the Hospital of České Budějovice a. s. This target was reached successfully. It follows from the results of this thesis that the share of endangered newborns with the absent transiently evoked oto-acoustic emissions at least on one ear is higher in the group of endangered newborns in comparison with non-endangered newborns, and there is a higher share of hearing defects in the group of pathological newborns in comparison with the physiological newborns. The postulated hypotheses were confirmed by these findings. This bachelors thesis shows the feasibility of the blanket screening in our conditions and its necessity for the timely discovery of hearing impediments and malfunctions...|$|E

40|$|A {{patient who}} had {{cervical}} conization performed due to {{carcinoma in situ}} of uterine cervix performed wished to undergo an artificial abortion. However, cervical stenosis and deformation prevented the probe from passing through the cervical canal, and the external os was unclear. Assisted by transvaginal ultrasonic echo, we injected potassium chloride to the fetus. Most of contents of the uterus were exhausted by postoperative day 4. By transvaginal ultrasonic <b>echo</b> <b>checked</b> at postoperative day 9, no contents were recognized in the uterine cavity. The human chorionic gonadotropin level from a urinary test was ascertained as under 50 IU/ 1. There has been no sign of recurrence of the carcinoma for 5 years, indicating that this method is available {{when there are no}} other safer treatments, as in this case for example...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective This paper {{intends to}} report our {{experiences}} {{by using an}} operation of off-pump occlusion of trans-thoracic minimal invasive surgery (OPOTTMIS) on the treatment of consecutive 210 patients with simple congenital heart diseases (CHD) including atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Methods The retrospective clinical data of OPOTTMIS in our institute were collected and compared to other therapeutic measures adopted in the relevant literatures. After operation, all the patients received electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography (echo) once a month within the initial 3 months, and no less than once every 3 ~ 6 months later. Results The successful rate of the performed OPOTTMIS operation was 99. 5 %, the mortality and complication incidence within 72 hours were 0. 5 % and 4. 8 %, respectively. There were no major complications during peri-operation such as cardiac rupture, infective endocarditis, strokes, haemolysis and thrombosis. The post-operation follow-up outcomes by ECG and <b>echo</b> <b>checks</b> of 3 months to 5 years showed {{that there were no}} III° AVB, no obvious Occluder migration and device broken and no moderate cardiac valve regurgitation, except 1 VSD and 1 PDA with mild residual shunts, and 2 PDA with heart expansion after operation. However, all the patients' heart functions were in class I~II according to NYH standard. Conclusion The OPOTTMIS is a safe, less complex, feasible and effective choice to selected simple CHD patients with some good advantages and favorable short term efficacies. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{successor}} was the similarly built Echo 2 (1964 {{to about}} 1970). This satellite circled the Earth about 400 km lower, not {{at an angle}} of 47° like that of Echo 1, but in a polar orbit with an average angle of 81°. This enabled radio contact and {{measurements to be made}} at higher latitudes. Taking part in the <b>Echo</b> orbit <b>checks</b> to analyze disturbances in its orbit and in the Earth's gravitational field were thirty to fifty professional earth stations, as well as around two hundred amateur astronomers across the planet in [...] "Moonwatch" [...] stations; these contributed around half of all sightings.|$|R
30|$|Here, the {{fundamental}} procedure and the observation {{parameters of the}} EAR–RASS experiments are summarized. First, we conducted the 3 -D ray tracing to the acoustic wave shape, referring to the updated wind velocity profiles with EAR and the climatological temperature profiles from archived radiosonde results. Then, we selected antenna beam directions that can cover a wide height range for RASS echoes. The frequency range of the FM-chirped acoustic signal was also appropriately adjusted (Masuda et al. 1992). Once RASS experiments began, {{the performance of the}} RASS <b>echo</b> acquisition was <b>checked,</b> and the observations parameters, especially the antenna beam directions, were changed every few hours.|$|R
30|$|Similarity-based trust {{management}} system (SBTMS): A similarity-based trust {{management system}} (SBTMS) checks for bogus safety event detection in node using similarity index. It assigns trust to one-hop neighbour in the network. This scheme also enhances decision-making power using trust and utilizing <b>echo</b> protocol to <b>check</b> reaction of reporting vehicle. This scheme is feasible {{when there is}} more meeting time between vehicles for communication to build a trust system. The second limitation is when a safety event elevator (SEE) sends echo safety event alert to a safety event reporter (SER). If SER does not reply due to signal loss or out of range communication from SEE, it is also considered as malicious data [81].|$|R
40|$|The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is {{a global}} network of {{coherent}} high frequency (HF) radars located in the polar, high- and mid-latitudes of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This thesis deals with close-range SuperDARN echoes (oblique HF backscatter from {{the lower part of}} the ionosphere). The aim of this thesis is to shed light on the origin of these echoes. Previous studies have been content to propose explanations for the origin of these <b>echoes</b> without thorough <b>checking</b> of the proposed mechanisms against constraints available from various radars and other important information. For the purpose of clarifying the situation, a chain of SuperDARN radars in the Northern and Southern hemispheres and several years of daily statistics have been used. This has allowed for several findings. Notably, the close-range SuperDARN echoes show diurnal and seasonal variations and their properties with respect to signal-to-noise-ratio, Doppler velocity and Doppler width vary. Three distinct populations of close-range HF backscatter have been established: (1) a morning population (0400 - 0700 LT), (2) a midday summer population (0800 - 1300 LT) and (3) a pre-midnight (2100 - 2300 LT) population. The morning population is associated with meteor trails which are observed to be peaking near local dawn as expected, and already suggested by previous research. High latitude SuperDARN radars also had echoes (pre-midnight population) with higher Doppler velocities than the others yet the Doppler velocities are smaller than that expected from auroral E region echoes. Given the time and location of this population of echoes, it has been concluded that they are a special class of high latitude E region echoes at high aspect angle which have been termed ``high aspect irregularity region" echoes in the past. Lastly, the midday summer population was found to be too high for polar mesosphere summer echoes and too early for plasma instabilities. It is proposed that these SuperDARN echoes are produced either from contribution from meteors trails or by neutral turbulence which is suspected (from other work) to be present near 100 km. The properties of the midday summer population resembles those of meteor trails as they have the same power, and the same altitude and have high summer occurrence as expected for meteors. Their late morning occurrence could be due to particular look direction of individual radars which may change the occurrence statistics in the presence of meteor showers. With respect to neutral turbulence, the drift of the midday summer population is similar to that of neutral wind...|$|R
