40|$|In the {{industrial}} sector approximately 30 % of the fuels used are consumed by furnaces. On top of that, 10 % of {{the industrial}} electricity demand is used in furnaces. Prior studies on <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>ovens</b> have concluded that potential for efficiency improvements lie between 10 and 40 % depending on the sector and the application. Within our paper we will describe an approach to assess the future energy demand of industrial furnaces. In addition, the corresponding CO 2 -emissions and saving potentials will be determined. The timeframe of our analysis is from 2015 to 2030 considering the EU- 28 countries and Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. To show the application of our methodology, we will present the glass sector as a case study. There, we will analyse the saving options corresponding to the furnaces used in glassmaking processes. For the purpose of our study we have built a proprietary bottom-up simulation model for energy demand. We will present the underlying methodology and data of our modelling approach. The dataset represents a detailed representation of the EUs glass production sites. Therefore, {{we are able to}} model the diffusion of the efficiency technologies on a site level. In parallel, we will present an approach to derive a dataset from sources like the ETS register. Finally, we will present the results of our modelling approach and discuss the potential impacts of energy efficiency technologies in the glass sector. Furthermore we will show the transferability of our approach to other sectors...|$|E
40|$|A new {{facility}} {{has been developed}} to test the tribological behavior (friction and wear) of PS 300 solid lubricant bushings at high temperatures. PS 300 is a commercially available solid lubricant invented at the NASA Glenn Research Center. It can be prepared as a plasma spray coating or as a free-standing powder metallurgy component, designated PM 300. PS 300 and PM 300 composites are designed to lubricate sliding components at temperatures above the capability of today's best oils, greases, and solid lubricants. One of the primary applications being pursued for PM 300 {{is the development of}} bushings for use in high-temperature machinery. Examples include inlet guide vane bushings for gas turbines and conveyors, and bearings for <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>ovens.</b> Encouraging preliminary field trials indicate that PS 300 and PM 300 lubricant materials have been commercialized successfully in several industrial applications. However, the lack of laboratory performance data has hindered further commercialization especially for new applications that differ significantly from the established experience base. The purpose of the newly developed bushing test rig will be to determine the performance characteristics of PM 300, and other materials, under conditions closely matching intended applications. The data will be used to determine engineering friction and wear rates and to estimate the life expectancy of bushings for new applications. In the new rig, the bushing is loaded against a rotating shaft inside a furnace enclosure (see the preceding photograph). Loads can vary from 5 to 200 N, speeds from 1 to 400 rpm, and temperatures from 25 to 800 C. Furnace temperature, bushing temperature, shaft speed, and torque are monitored during the test, and wear of both the bushing and the shaft is measured after testing is completed. Initially, PM 300 bushings will be evaluated and compared with lower temperature, traditional bushing materials like graphite and porous bronze. The baseline PM 304 composition is 60 wt% NiCr (a binder), 20 wt% Cr 2 O 3 (a hardener), 10 wt% BaF 2 /CaF 2 (a high-temperature lubricant), and 10 wt% Ag (a low-temperature lubricant). Future research efforts will include determining the effects of load, sliding speed, and temperature on tribological performance and, possibly, tailoring composition for specific applications. We expect that the availability of measured performance data will enhance the market penetration of PM 300 technology...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes the fundamentals ofmathematical modeling for the <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> boilersand {{presents the results}} from the numerical simulations of sometypical applications in advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> andboilers. The main objective of this thesis work is to employcomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology as an effectivecomputer simulation tool to study and develop the newcombustion concepts, phenomena and processes in advancedindustrial <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> boilers. The applications concern onfrom retrofitted conventional grate boilers to the mostadvanced highly preheated and diluted air combustion (HPDAC) furnaces. In this work, several topics are specially concernedwhen applying CFD technology to combustion cases. These topicsare including grate bed model, NOxmodeling, mixing problem, air staging system, andhighly preheated and diluted air combustion technology. In thiswork, a black-box grate bed model is developed and used inmodeling of grate fired <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> boilers. It is based onthe thermodynamic calculations and a set of conservationequations of mass, energy of fuel and air on the grate bed. Oneof benefits of this bed model is simple and feasible to be putinto use in industry. For NOxmodeling, besides the thermal NO and prompt NO,the HCN route fuel NO has been employed to predict the fuel NOemissions in coal/biomass fired furnaces. In addition, based onNH 3 route of fuel NO formation, a SNCR scheme for NOxabatement has been proposed also. For mixingproblem, the concepts of global degree of mixing and individualdegree of mixing have been proposed and used successfully inpractical applications. The new definition of degree of mixingovercomes some shortages of existed mixing parameters, such asthe mixing factor and the degree of non-mixing, which arenon-normalized and may lose physical meaning in some regions ofthe system. A new air staging system has been studied. It isused to improve the secondary or over-fire air configuration,thus to reduce the pollutant emissions and to enhance thecombustion facilities' efficiencies. In this work, the airstaging system has been employed in coal and biomass combustionfor grate fired furnaces/boilers. The performance of the newair staging system has been evaluated and optimized by usingnumerical modeling method together with physical modelingmethod. Results show that the new air staging system has a goodpotential of improving the combustion quality and reducing thepollutant emissions in <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> boilers. Recently, the highly preheated and diluted air combustiontechnology has been regarded as the new generation energytechnology for advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> boilers. Inthis work, the highly preheated and diluted air combustionphenomena have been studied by using different numericalmodels. A hybrid procedure of both the large eddy simulationusing subgrid-scale stress Smagorinsky model and the Reynoldsstress model with eddy dissipation model has been alsoinvestigated to study the dynamic combustion process under theconditions of highly preheated and diluted air combustion. Results show that HPDAC technology possesses advantages ofsaving energy and low NOxemission, thus it has high potential to be usedfor the next generation of <b>industrial</b> <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> boilers. Thelarge eddy simulation using subgrid-scale stress Smagorinskymodel together with Reynolds stress model / eddy dissipationmodel are possible to study the HPDAC dynamic process. Finally,this work shows that numerical modeling method is a verypromising tool to deal with the complicated combustionprocesses even for practical applications in industry.
