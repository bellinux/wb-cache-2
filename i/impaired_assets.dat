5000|$|A writedown is an {{accounting}} treatment that recognizes the reduced {{value of an}} <b>impaired</b> <b>asset.</b> The value of an asset may change due to fundamental changes in technology or markets. One example is when one company purchases another and pays more than the net fair value of its assets and liabilities. The excess purchase price is recorded on the buying company's accounts as goodwill. If it becomes apparent that the purchased asset {{no longer has the}} value recorded in the goodwill account (i.e., if the asset cannot be resold at the same price), the value in the goodwill asset account is [...] "written down". One example is when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones at a 60% premium in 2007, which News Corp. later had to write down by $2.8 billion because of declining advertising revenues.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explains}} the recent decline in bank asset quality using {{the notion of}} information reusability. Banks are viewed as information processors; they exist because of their advantage in extracting the surplus associated with the reusability of borrower-specific information. It is shown that a bank's incentive to screen loan applicants, and hence maintain {{the quality of its}} assets, depends on the surplus this screening can produce, which in turn depends on information reusability. Two recent changes in banks' operating environment are increased competition and greater temporal volatility in borrower credit risks. The former has directly reduced banks' informational surplus while the latter has impaired information reusability. Hence screening expenditures have been reduced and the diminution of screening has lowered the quality of bank assets. It is also shown that an increase in deposit insurance premia has an effect similar to that of narrowing interest spreads and therefore will result in reduced <b>asset</b> screening and <b>impaired</b> <b>asset</b> quality. ...|$|R

Failure to identify deterioration in credit quality in a timely manner can aggravate and prolong the problem. Two key issues arise with regard to the use of collateral in the context of loan classification and provisioning. In particular, the questions arise whether collateral should be taken into account in classifying a collateralized loan, and whether it should be considered in calculating provisions.

Less agreement is evident {{on the role of}} foreign banks in achieving this goal. We explore this issue by studying bank-specific data on lending by domestically- and foreign-owned banks in Argentina and Mexico. We find that foreign banks generally have had higher loan growth rates than their domesticallyowned counterparts, with lower proportionate volatility of lending, contributing to lower overall volatility of credit. Additionally, in both countries, foreign banks show notable credit growth during crisis periods. In Argentina, the loan portfolios of foreign and domestic privately-owned banks are similar, and lending rates analogously expand in response to aggregate demand fluctuations. In Mexico, foreign and domestic banks with lower levels of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> have similar loan responsiveness and portfolios. Stateowned banks (Argentina) and banks with high levels of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (Mexico) have more stagnant loan growth and weak responsiveness to market signals.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{success of}} Australian and Canadian banks in weathering the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) {{has been noted}} {{by a number of}} commentators. Their earnings, capital levels and credit ratings have all been a source of envy for regulators of banks in Europe, America and the United Kingdom. The G- 20 and the European Union have tried to identify the features of the Canadian and Australian financial systems which have underpinned this success in order to use them in shaping a revised international regulatory framework. Despite this perceived success, the <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (also known as non-performing loans) of banks in both countries increased several fold over the GFC, and we investigate the determinants of this, using <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> as our measure of bank risk. Previous studies in other countries have tended to focus on the impact of bank specific factors, such as size and return on equity, in explaining bank risk. Our approach involves including those traditional variables, plus Distance to Default (DD), and a novel contagion variable, which is the effect of major global bank DD on Australian and Canadian banks. Using panel data regression over the period 1999 - 2008, we find that various balance sheet and income statement factors are not good explanatory variables for bank risk. In contrast, the contagion variable is significant in explaining Canadian and Australian bank risk, which suggests that prudential regulators should look to specifically allocate a portion of regulatory capital to deal with contagion effects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the accounting performance of the firms recognizing impairment losses and analyze the accounting behavior of those firms. We focus on two performance measures, i. e. sales margin and earnings to average total asset (ROA). Firms recognizing impairment losses experienced the decrease in ROA before. After the recognition of impairment losses, ROA was improved. That time-series movement is consistent with the conventional view. However, profit margin did not change in such a clear manner. Although, some firms with impairment losses smoothed earnings, we can find only weak evidence on earnings increasing management. On the other hand, we detect the strong evidence of "big bath" accounting. Our results imply the defects in accounting standards of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets,</b> which permits the large room of managerial discretion. ...|$|E

40|$|Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No. 136, Impairment of Assets, {{was issued}} in 2005. The {{standard}} requires public listed companies {{to report their}} non-current assets at no more than their recoverable amount. When the value of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> is recovered, or partly recovered, FRS 136 requires the impairment charges to be reversed to its new recoverable amount. This study tests whether the reversal of impairment losses by Malaysian firms is more closely associated with economic reasons or reporting incentives. The sample of this study consists of 182 public companies listed on Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) that reported reversals of their impairment charges during the period 2006 - 2009. These firms are matched with firms which do not reverse impairment {{on the basis of}} industrial classification and size. In the year of reversal, this study finds that the reversal firms are more profitable (before reversals) than their matched firms. On average, the Malaysian stock market values the reversals of impairment losses positively. These results suggest that the reversals generally reflect increases {{in the value of the}} previously <b>impaired</b> <b>assets.</b> After partitioning firms that are likely to manage earnings and those that are not, this study finds that there are some Malaysian firms which reverse the impairment charges to manage earnings. Their reversals are not value-relevant, and are negatively associated with future firm performance. On the other hand, the reversals of firms which are deemed not to be earnings managers are positively associated with both future firm performance and current stock price performance, and this is the dominant motivation for the reversal of impairment charges in Malaysia. In further analysis, this study provides evidence that the opportunistic reversals are also associated with other earnings management manifestations, namely abnormal working capital accruals and the motivation to avoid earnings declines. In general, the findings suggest that the fair value measurement in impairment standard provides useful information to the users of financial statements...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{three aspects}} {{important}} of performance for Zambia commercial banks. Specifically, the thesis addresses {{the aspect of}} cost efficiency and the factors that affect inefficiency performance. The study also empirically answers the policy question regarding the banks' exercise of market power and the low degree of competition. Using a richly assembled panel data set obtained from the Bank of Zambia on individual banks from 1998 to 2006, the thesis utilises theoretically sound methodologies in addressing these research questions. The results from the analysis reveal the following. Firstly, using stochastic frontier estimation approach, cost inefficiency {{was estimated to be}} 8 percent. This means that mismanagement of resources was an impediment to the efficiency performance. Nonetheless, we observed a reduction in cost inefficiency over time, with domestic private banks displaying remarkable improvement. A combination of bank-specific and exogenous factors deterred banks from attaining optimal cost efficiency. Notably, <b>impaired</b> loans, <b>asset</b> concentration and macroeconomic instability undermined the banks' ability to operate optimally. Regulatory factors did not exacerbate cost inefficiency. Secondly, Zambian banks operated in an oligopolistic set-up. Based on a methodology anchored in the New Empirical Industrial Organisation literature, the results of a competitive test showed that banks earned their revenue under conditions of monopolistic competition. This finding was buttressed by the estimated time varying Lerner Index, a measure of market power. The index showed that commercial banks set their prices above marginal cost by more than 50 percent. However, the degree of market power narrowed {{towards the end of the}} sample period. Market concentration, efficiency performance, diversity in revenue sources and regulatory intensity accounted for much of the banks' exercise of market power. On the other hand, the high proportion of interbank deposits, credit risk exposure and inflation dampened the banks' exercise of market power. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in Zambia. Therefore, the results of the thesis have important policy implications. More significantly, since there is room for deepening the degree of competition and furthering efficiency gains, regulatory authorities should strengthen measures aimed at ameliorating risk problems in the banking industry in a bid to lower the banks' exercise of market power. The authorities should also accelerate should also accelerate efforts of reducing recourse to Treasury bills as a deficit financing tool in order to negate the banks' appetite for securities as a source of revenue. This can be done by placing more emphasis on the legal and institutional framework for resolving problem credit situations. This will intensify competition and propagate efficiency gains in the banking market. The authorities should also expeditiously tackle instability in the macroeconomic environment, particularly the high rate of inflation which hampered the banks' revenue performance and exacerbated the exercise of market powe...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of herding {{behaviour}} on the credit quality of bank loans in Australia. We find that bank herding varies with different types of loans. It tends to be more prevalent in owner-occupied housing loans and credit cards than other types of loans. During the global financial crisis period, herding in owner-occupied housing loans was most pronounced due to the flight-to-quality phenomenon in the housing sector. Furthermore, we find that the big four banks tend to herd more than smaller and regional banks. Bank herding behaviour is countercyclical, as it is negatively related to real GDP growth and the cost of funding but is positively related to market risk. Regulatory capital requirements may also encourage herding as banks are required to hold less risk-weighted capital for residential loans. Most importantly, bank herding is related to higher <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> and therefore lower loan quality. Our findings may have implications for policymakers and bank regulators...|$|E

The analysis is based on a specially constructed data base of credit loss and provisioning data retrieved from original financial reports published by Australian and New Zealand banks. The observation period covers 1980 to 2005, starting at the time when such information was published for the first time in bank financial statements. It moreover covers the time of major crises which occurred in both Australia and New Zealand in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. The heterogeneity of reporting the data both amongst banks and through time requires the development of a reporting typology which allows data extraction with equivalent informational content. As a thorough study of credit risks requires long data series often not available from third party data providers, the method developed here will provide value to a range of researchers. Based on an evaluation of many alternative proxies which track a bank's credit loss experience (CLE), the thesis proposes a preferred model for <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> expense (as % of loans) as dependent variable, mainly because of its timely nature and good data availability. Explanatory variables include aggregate macro variables of which changes in unemployment and the return in the share markets are found to have the most significant influence on a bank's credit losses. Bank-specific control variables include a pre-provision earnings proxy whose significance points to the use of provisions for the purpose of income smoothing by Australasian banks. The model also controls for size and nature of lending as smaller, retail-oriented housing lenders, on average, exhibit lower loan losses. Clear results are found with regard to the effect of rapid expansion which appears to be followed by a surge of bad debt provisions 2 to 3 years later. Moreover, inefficient banks tend to suffer greater credit losses. An important part of the thesis looks at the characteristics of alternative CLE proxies such as stock of provisions, <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> and write-offs which have been used by earlier literature. Estimating the preferred model with such alternative CLE parameters confirms their peculiarities such as the memory character of stock of provisions and the delayed nature of write-offs. These measures correlate rather poorly amongst themselves which calls for caution in the comparative interpretation of earlier studies that use differing CLE proxies...|$|E

In the chain of procedures for determining the depreciation of an asset/cash generating unit is required first the crossing phase of identification to an possible <b>impaired</b> <b>assets,</b> being necessary for the strict professional reasoning to each business. Applying the test impairment is not random and not to all assets of an enterprise. In general, the standard requires for companies to make the impairment tests when there are signs that an asset may be impaired (but annually for intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and commercial fund). The opportunity given by IAS 36 " Depreciation of Assets" to choose in determining of recoverable amount, between two values is not accidental. It is considered that the company can recover the value of its assets through use or market capitalization. However measurement of the two values is a complex process, very expensive for many businesses, own estimates based on Management Company with a strong subjective load, which is reflected on the certainty and reliability of obtained data.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{prompted}} by the gradual deterioration in asset quality in most commercial banks in Zimbabwe after {{the adoption of the}} multiple currency exchange rate regime. The poor asset qualities were reflected by the non-performing loans trending towards the watch list category. In this regard we investigated the commercial bank credit process with the objective of understanding the fundamental causes of the <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> that are bedeviling the Zimbabwean banking sector so that some of the mistakes are not repeated and correctional measures are put in place. The methodology adopted a survey research design with use of questionnaires and interviews with commercial banks head credit risk, head retail and head corporate banking division from 15 registered commercial banks in Zimbabwe. Research findings show that some banks were sitting on nonperforming loans due to poor credit analysis processes; wrong products offered to the clients; lending based on balance sheet strength instead of cash flow based lending; banks taking too much comfort in security; information asymmetry leading to moral hazard; economic environment and political influence. Key recommendations include an urgent setting up of the Credit Bureau; banks should not adjust clients request and the need for banks to consider the economic environment and adjust their credit culture. The central bank need...|$|E
40|$|Fortunately {{it seems}} that Australia and New Zealand have been spared {{the worst of the}} present {{financial}} crisis and they have not had to find out whether their procedures for handling troubled cross-border banks actually work as intended. However, they have already found out that not having any form of deposit insurance seems to be an error in a crisis. Europe has not been so lucky and this paper looks at the implications of that experience for Australia and New Zealand. It focuses on three issues: the early detection of problems and their swift correction; the nature of insolvency regimes that can be run across borders and the problem of deposit insurance. In particular Europe has found that it could not act as fast as it wanted to head off problems; that some resolution techniques do not appear to work well and that state ownership and open bank assistance have proved more necessary than expected. It has proved particularly difficult to handle <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> and the debate about whether to set up ‘bad banks ’ has emerged again. The paper concludes that while making sure that any systemically significant banking operations in second country should be capable of being free-standing, as required at present, that this does not overcome the problems and bank creditor recapitalisation may prove more difficult than hoped...|$|E
