Because of its location within the Vatican State and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance.

Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the <b>external</b> <b>masonry</b> of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small vestry or stairwell.

40|$|This {{research}} {{establishes the}} concept of ‘Green Maintenance’ modelling for historic masonry buildings. It recognises {{the important role of}} maintenance and repair in reducing embodied carbon expenditure, thus minimising the Environmental Maintenance Impact (EMI) typically associated with the deterioration of <b>external</b> stone <b>masonry</b> walls. The model was developed using a mathematical framework, and it generated results described in terms of EMI. This model utilises life-cycle assessment (LCA) ‘cradle-to-site’ over a selected maintenance period. The work evaluates embodied carbon expenditure from different stone masonry wall repair techniques for historic masonry buildings during their maintenance phase. It was discovered that embodied carbon expenditure for these repair techniques are highly influenced by the number of maintenance interventions, longevity of repairs, total wall surface repaired (m 2), the embodied carbon coefficient value (‘cradle-to-gate’) and kg/km emission factors (‘gate-to-site’) associated with materials and repair processes. Based on the EMI in terms of embodied carbon expenditure generated from the results of ‘Green Maintenance’, the efficiency of stone masonry wall repair techniques can be determined. This not only aids in maintenance decisions making processes, but also contributes in substantiating the philosophical defensibility and sustainability of interventions. In the broader sense, this model is not simply confined to masonry and will be of use to those entrusted with the repair of other elements and components...|$|R

Calcium silicate and sand cement bricks were tested for their mechanical properties. Investigations were carried out on six masonry bearing walls. Each unit measured 1000 mm × 1000 mm and a half brick thick. The structural behaviour due to compressive axial load was investigated and it shows that both bricks satisfy the requirement as load bearing wall.

40|$|Fiber Reinforced Polymers {{have become}} a popular {{material}} for <b>external</b> strengthening of <b>masonry</b> structures in the last years, but still further investigations are {{needed in order to}} develop appropriate design procedures. Investigating the behaviour and performance of retrofitted masonry elements with FRP composite sheets requires considering different mechanisms and issues. Among them, the most important is the bond between FRP and substrate due to its function in transferring the stresses from the FRP sheets to the structure. Hence, conducting experimental and numerical studies for understanding the bond and its degradation mechanism due to environmental exposure is a critical subject in predicting the performance of strengthened structures. As the available information on the durability of bond in FRP retrofitted masonry elements is still rare, conducting extensive experimental and numerical studies for characterizing this phenomenon is an important issue. This paper presents a simple degradation model into an available interface model for investigating the bond degradation in retrofitted masonry elements. For this reason, at first the interface model is calibrated with the experimental tests performed at University of Minho, and then the degradation of the bond is implemented in this model through a simplified approach...|$|R

5000|$|Located on Little Trodgers Lane, on a 400 ft. hill {{midway between}} {{the valley of}} the River Rother and the village of Mark Cross, ground was broken for the {{original}} orphanage in 1864. It cost £20,000 to build and took four years to complete. Many of the Canterbury red clay bricks were dug from the 109 acre plot at sites which later became a rifle range to the south-east and a pond to the south. They were fired in situ and transported 200 yards to the building area. Most of the <b>external</b> <b>masonry</b> was made from local sandstone also quarried nearby. [...] The main wall was built 3 ft 3ins in thickness (approx. 1 meter) and the internal masonry was in Caen stone. The passages, original play rooms and offices were in finished brickwork. The basement is vaulted and the floor of the first story laid with Mintons patent tiles. Above the ground floor the walls are recessed and arched, the piers of which are further relieved by corbelled brickwork. A gothic-style chapel accommodating 150 was added to the east and to the north a playground was laid. On the far north side of the playground a series of buildings were added at right angles, intended for a laundry, bake-house and workshops. The contractor was a Mr Wilson of Canterbury. In front of the school to the south lay extensive fields, meadows and woods. In the early years the school was self-sufficient with its own chicken run, most of the fields were cultivated or used for grazing and on the opposite hill was Pennybridge Farm, owned by the school and managed by the Brothers who employed labourers to run it. Milk and orchard produce were of sufficient quantity for the school to be a major trading partner with Mayfield Village and its Convent. Later cultivation ceased in the field immediately in front of the school where football (later cricket and rugby) pitches were laid out. A cultivated plot with lawns and a cemetery to one side were also installed. Until 1913 Pugin's vision stood untouched as a distinguished edifice visible from many miles around, faithful to his plans, but owing to faulty foundations the building had to be underpinned at this time. The tower and other heavy adornments were removed and its external beauty was sacrificed for practical safety. It was almost a century before the tower was replaced and the building's majesty restored.|$|E
