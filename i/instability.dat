5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the <b>instability</b> strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the <b>instability</b> strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this <b>instability</b> strip.|$|E

Two types of <b>instabilities</b> have been identified: (1) convective type that corresponds to long wavelengths, and (2) morphological type that corresponds to short wavelengths. These <b>instabilities</b> are coupled but while the convective <b>instabilities</b> depend strongly on gravity, the morphological <b>instabilities</b> are practically independent of gravity. For low velocities, the convective <b>instabilities</b> occur at much lower solute concentrations than the morphological <b>instabilities,</b> whereas at high velocities the reverse is true...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the role of <b>instabilities</b> on Africa low rates of growth during the seventies and eighties, using {{cross-section}} econometric estimates, on a sample of African and non African countries and two pooled decades. Africa exhibits higher "primary" <b>instabilities</b> (climatic, terms of trade and political <b>instabilities),</b> i. e. <b>instabilities</b> which are structural rather than the result of policy. These "primary" <b>instabilities</b> influence Africa growth, through a lower growth residual more than a lower average rate of investment. They do so by their impact on economic policy, which is evidenced by their influence on two "intermediate" <b>instabilities,</b> the <b>instabilities</b> of the rate of investment and of the real exchange rate, which significantly lower the rate of growth. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of electromagnetic <b>instabilities</b> in nonuniform plasmas are analyzed, {{taking into account}} the anisotropy in temperature and temperature gradients.

5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational <b>instability.</b> Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational <b>instability.</b> This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational <b>instability</b> within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density – often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy).

5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange <b>instability.</b> The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor <b>instability</b> in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The <b>instability</b> leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} role of QCD plasma <b>instabilities</b> in non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasmas.

40|$|Subject to a {{compressive}} membrane stress, {{an elastic}} film bonded on a substrate can become unstable, forming wrinkles, creases or delaminated buckles. Further increasing the compressive stress can induce advanced modes of <b>instabilities</b> including period-doubles, folds, localized ridges, delamination, and coexistent <b>instabilities.</b> While various <b>instabilities</b> in film-substrate systems under compression have been analyzed separately, a systematic and quantitative {{understanding of these}} <b>instabilities</b> is still elusive. Here we present a joint experimental and theoretical study to systematically explore the instabil-ities in elastic film-substrate systems under uniaxial compression. We use the Maxwell stability criterion to analyze the occurrence and evolution of <b>instabilities</b> analogous to phase transitions in thermodynamic systems. We show that the moduli of the film and the substrate, the film-substrate adhesion strength, the film thickness, and the prestretch in the substrate determine various modes of <b>instabilities.</b> Defects in the film-substrate system can facilitate it to overcome energy barriers during occurrence and evolution of instabil-ities. We provide a set of phase diagrams to predict both initial and advanced modes of <b>instabilities</b> in compressed film-substrate systems.
