40|$|The {{success and}} {{popularity}} of social network systems, such as del. icio. us, Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube, have generated many interesting and challenging problems {{to the research}} community. Among others, discovering social interests shared by groups <b>of</b> <b>users</b> is very important because it helps to connect people with common interests and encourages people to contribute and share more contents. The main challenge to solving this problem comes from the difficulty of detecting and representing the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>users.</b> The existing approaches are all based on the online connections <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and so unable to identify the common <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> who have no online connections.

40|$|For {{the current}} {{exponential}} growth of World Wide Web (WWW), {{there have been}} a lot of information gathering tools to help people cope with the volume of information on the WWW. However, these tools are insufficient to find information attracting personal <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> a <b>user</b> with high precision and recall.

Preliminary experiments show that eye movements provide a rich input modality from which {{it is possible to}} learn the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>user.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the World Wide Web has {{complicated}} the process of web browsing by providing an overwhelming wealth of choices for the end user. To alleviate this burden, intelligent tools can do much of the drudge-work of looking ahead, searching and performing a preliminary evaluation of the end pages on the user’s behalf, providing the user with more information with which to make fewer, more informed decisions. In order to accomplish this task, however, the tools need some form of representation <b>of</b> the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>user.</b> This paper describes the SWAMI system; SWAMI stands for “Searching the Web with Agents having Mobility and Intelligence”. SWAMI is a prototype that uses a multi-agent system to represent the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>user</b> dynamically, and take advantange of the active nature of agents to provide a platform for look-ahead evaluation, page searching, and link swapping. The collection of agents is organized hierarchically according to the apparent <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>user,</b> which are discovered dynamically through multi-stage clustering. Results from testing show that such a system is able to follow the multiple changing <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> a <b>user</b> accurately, {{and that it is}} capable of acting fruitfully on these interests to provide a user with useful navigational suggestions. ...|$|R
50|$|All {{forms of}} {{advertising}} scored {{low in the}} trust factor study by the Nielsen Report on Global Trust in Advertising and Brand Messages from April 2012. But Facebook’s “recommendations from people I know” scored highest on the trust factor, with 92 percent of consumers having no problem believing this source. Also brand web sites, scored higher than paid advertising, but lower than social recommendations. The promotion of product or services through known people piqued <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> {{as well as the}} views of ads much more efficiently than banner ads. This way advertisers are able to elicit and transfer feelings of safety and trust from friends to the ads shown, thereby validating the ads. The social pressure by the peer group has the ability to not make the users view ads but also encourage them to change attitudes, and consequent behavior in order to adapt to group customs.|$|E
