50|$|The Korsunsky work-of-indentation {{approach}} is a method of extracting a value of hardness for a small volume of material from indentation test data. Instead of relying on measurements or assumptions pertaining {{to the area of}} contact between indenter and sample, the method uses the load-displacement data registered in the continuously recorded <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> (CRIT) that is particularly widely applied in nanoindentation experiments. In particular, the method re-defines hardness and expresses it in terms of the energy (work) associated with indenting the surface of a material by the probe. The work-of-indentation used in the analysis may refer to the total, elastic or dissipated energy, depending on the formulation. The approach was found to be particularly useful in the analysis of thin coatings, nano-multi-layers, nanoscale features.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} <b>indentation</b> <b>testing,</b> RPI testing {{uses the}} location of measurement as the relative displacement reference position. Indentation itself {{is perhaps the most}} commonly applied means of testing the mechanical properties of materials. The technique has its origins in the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, in which materials are ranked according to what they can scratch and are, in turn, scratched by. The characterization of solids in this way takes place on an essentially discrete scale, so much effort has been expended in order to develop techniques for evaluating material hardness over a continuous range. Hence, the adoption of the Meyer, Knoop, Brinell, Rockwell, and Vickers hardness tests. More recently (ca. 1975), nanoindentation techniques have been established as the primary tool for investigating the hardness of small volumes of material. However, even more recently (ca. 2006), interest in measuring functional roles of biomaterials drove the development of the Reference Point Indentation technique.|$|E

Review of previous studied reveals that <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> technique has been drawing increasing attempts in investigations of binder material mechanical properties. Various properties of bitumen, e. g. elastic, viscoelastic, have been successfully determined by <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> at different scales and test conditions. The response of bitumen to indentation was studied extensively under a wide range of test parameters such as temperature, loading rate, indenter geometry, etc. This experimental tool was also applied to asphalt cements grading and microstructure study.

Spherical indentations have been performed with balls of different curvature radii at - 5 oC.

We consider frictionless flat-ended and spherical sinusoidally-driven <b>indentation</b> <b>tests</b> utilizing displacement-controlled loading protocol. Articular cartilage tissue is modeled as a viscoelastic material with a time-independent Poisson's ratio. We study the dynamic indentation stiffness with the aim of formulating criteria for evaluation the quality of articular cartilage in order to be able to discriminate its degenerative state. In particular, evaluating the dynamic indentation stiffness at the turning point of the flat-ended <b>indentation</b> <b>test,</b> we introduce the so-called incomplete storage modulus. Considering the time difference between the time moments when the dynamic stiffness vanishes (contact force reaches its maximum) and the dynamic stiffness becomes infinite (indenter displacement reaches its maximum), we introduce the so-called incomplete loss angle. Analogous quantities can be introduced in the spherical sinusoidally-driven <b>indentation</b> <b>test,</b> however, to account for the thickness effect, a special approach is required. We apply an asymptotic modeling approach for analyzing and interpreting the results of the dynamic spherical <b>indentation</b> <b>test</b> in terms of the geometrical parameter of the indenter and viscoelastic characteristics of the material.

40|$|<b>Indentation</b> <b>testing</b> {{has long}} been a {{standard}} test used to classify all types of materials. In the past several decades the scale of <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> has moved into the micron and even sub-micron range. For many types of materials, at these small length scales, the hardness of the material measured by the indentation test depends on the depth of the indentation. This indentation size effect was not observed at the larger length scales. Because <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> with conical or pyramidal indenter tips is geometrically similar, the existence of a size effect was surprising. Since the size effect associated with microindentation was discovered, many the-ories about its cause have been proposed. Several of the theories suggest that the source of the indentation size effect is experimental error. Such factors as inaccurate measurement of the contact area, indenter tip deformities, improper surface prepara-tion, lateral movement of the indenter tip, inhomogeneity of the material, compliance of the test fixture, anisotropic deformations, thermal drift, and noise have been cited as areas where experimental error {{may play a role in}} the size effect.

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the tensile properties by spherical indentation {{is based on the}} relation of Tabor, which links the mean pressure and the indent diameter, obtained from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests,</b> to the stress and strain determined from a tensile test, respectively. However, in order to improve the indentation-tensile relationship, an additional correction related to the piling-up or sinking-in formation around the indent {{must be taken into account}} for the calculation of the strain by indentation. The correction factor is expressed as a function of the strain-hardening exponent. As a consequence, to validate such methodology, majority of the authors use the strain-hardening exponent previously determined by a tensile test. Unfortunately, this approach obviously impedes a direct construction of the tensile curve from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests</b> since the strain-hardening exponent will be undetermined. In addition, the tensile stress to mean pressure ratio is not a constant value because it depends on the mechanical properties and on the deformation regime.
