5|$|Fox {{played and}} financed cricket and rugby in Somerset; he played cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club from 1877 to 1882, and {{remained}} as a vice-president {{of the club}} until his death. He founded Wellington Rugby Football Club in 1874, and was an administrator and captain of the Somerset Rugby Football Union. After retiring as a rugby player, he continued to take part as an umpire. In 1884 he started mountaineering, and within two years he was {{well known in the}} mountain climbing community, and a well-regarded alpine explorer. In 1888, he and William Frederick Donkin travelled to the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire in a bid to be the <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> to climb Koshtan-Tau. The pair, along with their Swiss guides, died in an accident during the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E

The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very <b>first</b> <b>ones,</b> there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, two {{publishers}} {{started a}} legal battle {{for the right to}} the names of the newspapers and magazines. Vandersteen, caught in the middle, worked a while for both, but eventually switched to the new owners of De Standaard. He continued to work for Ons Volkske, which was now renamed 't Kapoentje for a few more months. The publishers of De Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske, which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947. By 1947, seven albums were available, and the <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> were already reprinted. The first albums of De Familie Snoek had also appeared by then. Supported by large publicity campaigns, they sold very well: the first Snoek album was in its third impression by 1948. The popularity of Vandersteen, and the impact comics had in Flanders, is attested by the 25,000 readers who switched to the Standaard {{at the same time as}} Vandersteen did.|$|E

Markary and Sanya are temporarily trapped inside the ship, but manage to escape and return to the Argos. Carter inexplicably vanishes.|$|E

Along with the first leased ones, the two brand new aircraft —which became the <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> acquired by the company in 17 years— were incorporated into the fleet in mid-2009.

25|$|Once {{the initial}} town plat was finalized, {{the land was}} divided into lots, with the <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> offered for sale on October 8, 1821.

Initially, there were no plans to plat the area outside the Mile Square, but later, additional tracts of land were divided into irregular-sized blocks and lots.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E

50|$|The find {{first set}} or find <b>first</b> <b>one</b> {{operation}} identifies the index or {{position of the}} 1-bit with the smallest index in an array, and has widespread hardware support (for arrays not larger than a word) and efficient algorithms for its computation. When a priority queue is stored in a bit array, find <b>first</b> <b>one</b> {{can be used to}} identify the highest priority element in the queue. To expand a word-size find <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to longer arrays, one can find the first nonzero word and then run find <b>first</b> <b>one</b> on that word. The related operations find first zero, count leading zeros, count leading ones, count trailing zeros, count trailing ones, and log base 2 (see find first set) can also be extended to a bit array in a straightforward manner.|$|R
