40|$|PURPOSE: Propose {{a new and}} {{alternative}} surgical procedure in order to aid on treatments of chronic ulcers with non-arterial etiology in the lower limbs, especially those that reoccurs and accomplish of <b>dermatosclerosis</b> and skin contractures determining ankle and foot limits. METHODS: It describes a medical case regarding a female, 54 years old, with a pre-existing ulcer (sixteen years) on her left leg. Despite of conventional treatments such as curatives, compressive therapy and surgeries, the ulcer on her leg was not cured for three years. The skin <b>dermatosclerosis</b> on her foot and ankle limited her mobility tremendously. The surgery involved the debridement of the ulcers, local phlebectomies and the correction of her scar contraction by a transversal escharotomies. Conventional procedures were applied in pre and post-surgery. RESULTS: After twelve weeks, the ulcer was completely healed by second intention. Despite the odds, she regained sustainable mobility in her foot and ankle, allowing this patient to wear medical elastic socks. Reoccurrences of the ulcer did not occur during the two years post-surgery. CONCLUSION: The transversal escharotomies may favor the healing of non-arterial chronic ulcers in the lower limbs, impeding perpetual mechanisms of this sort. For example, the ankle and foot limitation determinates in secondary scars, skin contractures, <b>dermatosclerosis</b> that produce the failure in the muscular calf-pump with deterioration in the ascending venous propulsion...|$|E
40|$|Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) {{is a common}} health problem, particularly in the elderly. Poor blood flow in the veins of the legs can cause leg pain, swelling, oedema, and pruritus (itchiness), as well as <b>dermatosclerosis</b> (hardening of the skin), varicose veins and skin ulceration. 1, 2 The condition {{is thought to be}} caused by venous hypertension secondary to deep or superficial venous valvular reflux and results in pathologic inflammation...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Apresentar uma nova alternativa cirúrgica para auxiliar o tratamento de úlceras crônicas de etiologia não arterial em membros inferiores, especialmente aquelas com recidivas e complicadas por contraturas de pele, limitando movimentos do pé e tornozelo. MÉTODOS: Descrição de caso de uma paciente portadora de úlcera em perna esquerda com dezesseis anos de evolução, múltiplas recidivas, sem cicatrização há três anos apesar de curativos convencionais, terapias compressivas e cirurgias. As contraturas cicatriciais e a dermatoesclerose local limitavam a marcha pela redução da mobilidade do pé e tornozelo. A cirurgia realizada foi o debridamento tangencial da úlcera, flebectomias locais e a correção das contraturas de pele por meio das escarotomias transversais. Após a cirurgia foram mantidos os mesmos padrões de curativos e a terapia compressiva utilizada no pré-operatório. RESULTADOS: Houve cicatrização completa da úlcera, por segunda intenção, doze semanas após a cirurgia com ganho importante na amplitude dos movimentos do pé e tornozelo, permitindo normalização da marcha e adaptação ao uso de meias elásticas terapêuticas. Não houve recidiva em dois anos de acompanhamento pós-operatório. CONCLUSÃO: Esta técnica parece favorecer a cicatrização de úlceras crônicas de etiologia não arterial atuando em mecanismos perpetuadores do processo, como, por exemplo, a limitação da propulsão venosa pela musculatura da panturrilha determinada por contraturas cicatriciais e pela dermatoesclerose do pé e tornozelo...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{fibrosis}} {{is characterized}} by activated fibroblasts and an altered architecture of the extracellular matrix. Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and altered cytokine levels in the dermal collagen matrix are common to several pathological situations such as localized scleroderma and systemic sclerosis, keloids, <b>dermatosclerosis</b> associated with venous ulcers and the fibroproliferative tissue surrounding invasively growing tumors. Which factors contribute to altered organization of dermal collagen matrix in skin fibrosis is not well understood. We recently demonstrated that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) functions as organizer of the dermal collagen I network in healthy human skin (Agarwal et al., 2012). Here we show that COMP deposition is enhanced in the dermis in various fibrotic conditions. COMP levels were significantly increased in fibrotic lesions derived from patients with localized scleroderma, in wound tissue and exudates of patients with venous leg ulcers and in the fibrotic stroma of biopsies from patients with basal cell carcinoma. We postulate enhanced deposition of COMP {{as one of the}} common factors altering the supramolecular architecture of collagen matrix in fibrotic skin pathologies. Interestingly, COMP remained nearly undetectable in normally healing wounds where myofibroblasts transiently accumulate in the granulation tissue. We conclude that COMP expression is restricted to a fibroblast differentiation state not identical to myofibroblasts which is induced by TGF beta and biomechanical forces. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
