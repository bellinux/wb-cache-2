30|$|As we {{know that}} module {{performance}} is greatly affected {{by the amount of}} <b>dust</b> <b>collected</b> on it [15], sometimes when we want to get the amount of difference value in efficiency of modules, the instruments for measuring it at that instant are not found.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the carbon brush had convenient side effects. Carbon brushes tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the commutator segments. There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> on the commutator segments.|$|E
5000|$|Sham dustbathing is a {{behaviour}} performed by some birds when kept in cages {{with little or}} no access to litter, during which the birds perform all the elements of normal dustbathing, but in the complete absence of any substrate. [...] This behaviour often has all the activities and temporal patterns of normal dustbathing, i.e. the bird initially scratches and bill-rakes at the ground, then erects her feathers and squats. Once lying down, the behaviour contains four main elements: vertical wing-shaking, head rubbing, bill-raking and scratching with one leg. Normal dustbathing is a maintenance behaviour whose performance results in <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> between the feathers. The dust is then subsequently shaken off which reduces the amount of feather lipids and so helps the plumage maintain good insulating capacity and may help control of ectoparasites.|$|E

It has been determined that the north-east and central parts of Tomsk are the most contaminated areas, where brickworks, coal and gas-fired thermal power plant are located. The analysis of long-term dynamics showed a dust load decrease in the vicinity of coal and gas-fired thermal power plant due to upgrading of the existing <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> systems.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a new <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> system {{equipped}} with an activated carbon (A. C.) coated electrode. Before fabrica-tion, pre-treatment of A. C. was performed to remove metal ions within the A. C. to enlarge its specific surface area. Then, pre-treated A. C., black carbon, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), and methanol were mixed to make a gel compound, which was coated onto aluminum plates to fabricate electrodes. The optimal mixing ratio of A. C., black carbon, PVAc, and methanol was found to be 10 g: 2 g: 3 g: 20 mL. After fabrication, the electrodes were used in the batch-type experiment for NH 3 and H 2 S removal. The reduction rates of the gases were high at the beginning and slowly reduced with time. Dust collection experiments were conducted in continuous flow, with various voltages applied. Compared to 5 kV, dust removal efficiency was 1. 5 times higher when 10 kV was applied. Increasing the number of electrodes applied also increased the collecting efficiency. The correlation coefficient between actual collecting efficiency and trend line was higher than 99 %. Consequently, the novel dust collection system equipped with A. C. coated electrode appears to be a promising substitute for existing dust-control devices...|$|E
40|$|On the 16 th June 2000, an {{aluminum}} dust deflagration {{occurred in a}} small factory in the north-west of Italy. The explosion took place in {{an aluminum}} <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> and abatement unit that served a surface polishing plant.

The cost of the deflagration cost was six injured workers, and relevant damage to the plant machinery, the process building and to other surroundings buildings. Although aluminum dust explosions are well known and have been well documented in the literature, this case study can be considered interesting because of its complex dynamics,which started with a first weak explosion that then evolved into a more severe chain of explosions. This article has drawn upon the official documents written during the investigation and the technical reports prepared by a number of expert witnesses. The data collected during the investigation have made it possible to determine the causes and dynamics of the accident and to calculate the strength of the explosion, {{on the basis of the}} distribution of the damage and the launching distance of the fragments. The magnitude of the damage seems to indicate that the amount of dust that took part in the explosion corresponds to the dust that settled on the bag filter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{improvement}} of the methods for calculating the efficiency for particles separation in these devices {{is the subject of}} article. Finding data show that the particles are discharged from the central zone to periphery by diffusive transport in the zone of high centripetal accelerations. It is found that the central zone is the ejection effect zone on the paraxial flow and intense discharge particle zone. The concentrations distribution and distribution of fractional efficiencies are presented. Cyclone devices are a major element in the gas dusting systems in the production of energy, chemicals and other industries. However, the {{improvement of}} the methods for calculating the efficiency for particles separation in these devices is the subject of many studies [1] till now. In practice the method for estimating the fractional separation efficiency by integral of the random variable probability is widely accepted [2]. In work [3] it is shown that introduction of dust particles in the wall zone does not guarantee their introduction into the <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> bag and theirs 100 % trapping. Ter Linden [4] plotted curves of particles separation equal efficiency. These particles introduced into the various points of the separation volume. It turned out that these curves pass through the point on the axis, i. e. the particles, which introduced below the entry section of the output channel on the axis, trapped with the same efficienc...|$|E
