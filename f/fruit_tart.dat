6000|$|Luncheon {{was ready}} for Sir Jervis Redwood's {{confidential}} emissary in the waiting-room. Detained at the final rehearsals of music and recitation, Miss Ladd was worthily represented by cold chicken and ham, a <b>fruit</b> <b>tart,</b> and a pint decanter of generous sherry.

6000|$|Luncheon-time {{came and}} Sir Percival did not return. The Count took his friend's {{place at the}} table, plaintively devoured {{the greater part of}} a <b>fruit</b> <b>tart,</b> {{submerged}} under a whole jugful of cream, and explained the full merit of the achievement to us as soon as he had done. [...] "A taste for sweets," [...] he said in his softest tones and his tenderest manner, [...] "is the innocent taste of women and children. I love to share it with them--it is another bond, dear ladies, between you and me." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{this second}} dwelling, a stone's throw from the other, {{we found a}} small party of {{sensible}} and well-bred people, who received me as a stranger, with marked politeness, but with great simplicity. I was struck with the repast, which was exactly like what a country tea is, or perhaps I ought to say, used to be, in respectable families, at home, who have not, or had not, much of the habits of the world. We all sat round a large table, and, among other good things that were served, was an excellent <b>fruit</b> <b>tart!</b> I could almost fancy myself in New England, where I remember a judge of a supreme court once gave me custards, at a similar entertainment. The family we had gone to see, were perhaps a little too elegant for such a set-out, for I had seen them in Rome with mi-lordi and monsignori, at their six o'clock dinners; but the quiet good sense with which everybody dropped into their own distinctive habits at home, caused {{me to make a}} comparison between them and ourselves, much to the disadvantage of the latter. I do not mean that usages ought not to change, but that usages should be consistent with themselves, and based on their general fitness and convenience for the society for which they are intended. This is good sense, which is commonly not only good-breeding, but high-breeding.|$|E

2500|$|The English custard tart and the Portuguese pastel de nata are European {{forerunners}} of the [...] Chinese egg tart which displays {{characteristics of}} both. Before egg tart {{was introduced to}} Hong Kong, it is reported that it was first found in 1920s Guangzhou.

[...] However, as butter was very costly at that time, {{it was difficult for}} the chefs to make puff pastry for the tarts. Therefore, they may have used lard instead.|$|R

50|$|Ripening is {{a process}} in fruits that causes them to become more palatable. In general, fruit becomes sweeter, less green, and softer as it ripens.

In families where there is a nursery, the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children, and makes it her luncheon.

5000|$|Each {{of the two}} hosts, Hiroshi Sekiguchi (関口宏) and Yuji Miyake (三宅裕司), {{chooses a}} {{particular}} dish for the contest, and oversees the dish's creation by his chef. For most of the show's run, Sekiguchi {{was in charge of}} the Red kitchen, and Miyake took the Yellow kitchen. In later episodes, the two dishes were pre-selected, and whichever meal Sekiguchi and Miyake prepared for his side was determined by a special dice throw. The competing dishes were typically from the same category; an example of a typical [...] "battle" [...] would be miso ramen versus salt-and-butter ramen. Other battles have included miso-based dishes versus mayonnaise-based dishes, chocolate fondant cake versus <b>fruit</b> <b>tart,</b> and even tacos versus spring rolls.|$|E
