40|$|Two {{markedly}} different geologic formations, the Baum limestone and Trinity sand and {{an area of}} intermixed talus were compared for several physical attributes and these correlated with {{the structure of the}} plant communities occupying them and with the variability of a conspicuous constituent {{for each of the three}} habitats. (1) Juniperus Ashei occupies the Baum Limestone in nearly pure stands, but with wide spacing, while the general cover consists of Bouteloua hirsula and Andropogon scoparius. The limestone has a high carbonate content, high <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>coefficient,</b> low soil moisture. (2) Juniperus virginiana occupies the Trinity sand on cleared, reverted land normally supporting a post-oak, black-jack oak forest. The junipers are widely spaced with oak forest in various stages of regeneration. Woody cover as well as ground cover is greater on the Trinity than on the Baum. The Trinity has low carbonate, low <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>coefficient,</b> high soil moisture. (3) The juniper population on the mixed talus sites are hybrid but closer to Juniperus Ashei. The various factors measured are intermediate between the other two habitats. (4) The data suggest that in southern Oklahoma J. Ashei develops plentifully in areas where the moisture content is low enough to limit J. virginiana, but as the habitats of the two species intergrade hybridization occurs, i. e., currently as well as historically, with only those hybrids surviving which are adapted to the intermediate habitats. (5) These mixed habitats are rich sources for continued hybridization and introgression until succession closes both the mixed habitats and the Trinity sand to junipers...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{study was}} conducted {{for the purpose of}} determining the effects of treatments with manure, lime and manure, and commercial fertilizers upon the physical properties of the soil. It was the object of this investigation to measure any differences which had come about {{as a result of the}} treatments. As a means of measuring these possible influences, the Atterberg constants, the moisture constants, and the volume weights were determined. The Atterberg constants which were used were the upper plastic limit, the lower plastic limit, the plasticity number, and the scouring point. The moisture constants employed in this study were the moisture equivalent, the <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the available water capacity, and the maximum water capacity. The greatest attention was focused upon the effects of manurial applications upon the soil, because the chief fertilizer used in Nebraska at the present time is manure. Advisors: M. D. Weldon and H.

40|$|Drought {{during the}} growing season of 1934 was the {{greatest}} ever recorded in the prairie region. It offered an exceptional opportunity to study the response of native plants to extremely adverse water relations. Measurements of the environmental factors of the prairie, in connection with various grassland researches, have now been completed, except for one year, for the seventeenth consecutive growing season. In a summary of findings at the end of twelve years it was stated that although periods of drought are liable to occur at any time, and especially after midsummer, yet only twice during these twelve years was the water content in the surface six inches of soil reduced to the <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>coefficient,</b> i. c. approximately the point where water is non-availahle for growth (Weaver aid Himmel, 2 ̆ 731). At no time was the available water in the deeper soil entirely exhausted. Drought periods when water was nonavailable in the surface foot occurred during 1931 and 1933 (Flory, 2 ̆ 734). Then came the extremely dry summer of 1934 during which the prairie was under the impact of almost continuous drought. These studies were made near Lincoln, Nebraska, hut similar conditions prevailed, in general, throughout the tall-grass prairie in the eastern one-third of the state, except in the extreme northeastern part...|$|E

40|$|There {{has long}} been a need for a simple, {{objective}} method of soi 1 texture classification {{as an alternative to the}} expensive and often needlessly accurate mechanical analysis. In this investigation the correlation between data on two different water retention parameters and clay content is examined. The water retention data used in this context are the moisture content at 50 % relative humidity and the water content at the permanent wilting point. The intention is to investigate the possibility of estimating clay content with sufficient accuracy to enable soi 1 texture to be classified from water retention data. The first part of the report consists of a 1 iterature review, in which the most important factors affecting the hygroscopic water and the water content at the permanent wilting point are discussed. The second part contains an account of the investigation and of the statistical relationships obtained. The investigation was carried out on 123 soil samples of different textural classes, representing the different types of arable land in Sweden. The soi 1 samples were analysed in the folloving respects; soi 1 texture (mechanical analysis), content of organic matter (determined as organic carbon), <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>coefficient</b> at 50 relative humidity, loss on ignition and water content at permanent wilting point. The results of the analyses were then treated statistica 11 y. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to compute the statistical relationships between different variables. The relationships examined were: 1. The relationship between hygroscopic moisture, c 1 ay content and loss on ignition (Glf). Equation (3). 2. The relationship between water content at the permanent wilting point (wt 150), clay content and loss on ignition. Equation (7). 3. Clay content as a function of hygroscopic moisture and loss on ignition. Equation (4). 4. Clay content as a function of wt 150 and loss on ignition. Equation (8). Clay contents for the 123 soi 1 samples were then calculated with the equations obtained and compared with the clay contents given by mechanical analysis. The equations were compared with each other in respect of determination coefficient (R 2) and the residua 1 variance obtained. The outcome of this comparison shows tnat equation (8), where the clay content is calculated from wt 150, gives a better correlation between the calculated clay contents and the clay contents given by mechanical analysis than that given by equation (4), where the clay content is calculated from hygroscopic moisture content. Equation (8) is given below; L = - 2, 5 + 2, 8 wt 150 - l, 7 Glf: Glf = loss on ignition In order to test the accuracy of the resu 1 ts, the clay contents for a collection of soil samples not used earlier in the investigation were ca 1 culated using equation (8). These values were then compaired with the clay contents given by mechanical analyses. The results show that although most of the estimated clay contents roughly coincide with the clay contents determined by mechanical analysis, some of the contents calculated diverge widely from those determined. The divergence is most extreme for soil samples with a large content of organic matter and especial 1 y if the percentage of organic matter exceeds the clay content. The reasens for this are discussed. In order to improve the calculation of clay contents some new equations were computed. One of these, equation (12), was obtained from 159 observations and restricted to apply only to mineral soils with a loss on ignition of less than 15 %. Equation (12) is given below: L =- 0, 4 + 2, 9 wt 150 - 1, 2 Glf: To obtain an estimation of how well the clay content of an individual soil sample can be calculated with this equation, a prediction interval was computed. The prediction interval shows that the calculated clay content for an individual observation chosen at random, with 95 %probability will deviate less than 6, 5 per cent from the value given by mechanical analysis. This error might be acceptable for soil samples with high clay content, makes the estimation of c 1 ay content very unreliab 1 e at low leve 1 s. Equations were also obtained, whereby the content of organic matter can be calculated with respect to water retention data...|$|E
40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing a low mass antenna which derives its reflector surface quality from {{the application of}} electrostatic forces to form a thin membrane into the desired concave reflector surface. The shuttle-deployed antenna would have a diameter of 100 m and an RMS surface smoothness of 10 to 1 mm for operation at 1 to 10 GHz. Surface quality measurements have been made on a highly deformable elastic membrane, pressurized by electrostatic forces. Included are {{the effects of the}} perimeter boundary, splicing of the membrane, the long-scale smoothness of commercial membranes, and the spatial controllability of the membrane using voltage adjustments to alter the electrostatic forces. The electrostatic membrane was found to operate well in an open-loop sense, showing a high degree of position stability and negligible power consumption in dry air. Visco-electric creep was not evident, but the polymer membrane did expand and contract considerably due to its <b>hygroscopic</b> expansion <b>coefficient.</b> A residual roughness of about 0. 75 mm existed with the polymer used in these tests; this error is attributed to seams and membrane anisotropy where the material is stiffer in one direction...|$|R
40|$|When a {{wood board}} {{is exposed to}} a change in {{relative}} humidity on only one of its surfaces, e. g. in case of flooring or a panel painting, the resulting asymmetric moisture content profile induces differential expansion over the thickness. Consequently a bending moment causes the board to curve. A theory is presented to describe the bending of a wood board due to a step change in relative humidity. The board is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly elastic. Moisture transport is presumed to obey the diffusion equation with constant coefficients, such that moisture transport can be directly related to the bending of the board. It is shown that the transient deflective behavior provides the diffusion coefficient and the final length change yields the linear <b>hygroscopic</b> expansion <b>coefficient.</b> Derived diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with values in literature. Furthermore, a scaling law for the deflection of the board is proposed, which is seen to be followed qualitatively but not quantitatively by experiments. Finally, by assuming the deflection of the board to be the response of a linear system, the deflective frequency response of the board can be predicted from its step response. The results allow upscaling of deflection and expansion, such that behavior of thick boards can be determined from an experiment using a thin board...|$|R
40|$|Soil spatial {{patterns}} in tropical forest may impact, or {{to some extent}} control, important characteristics of tropical forests such as forest biodiversity and carbon emissions. However, tropical forests are highly heterogeneous and therefore determining soil spatial patterns using traditional methods is highly labor intensive and destructive. As a result, rapid soil pattern-property assessment methods for use under tropical conditions are of great interest for evaluating soil patterns and properties at the plot scale. We evaluated the potential of electromagnetic-induction imaging (EMI) for determining spatial variation of soil properties in native tropical forest and teak plots during the dry and wet season. Geostatistical analysis of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by the EMI sensor revealed consistent semi-variogram ranges of ? 30 m over both time (dry season, wet season) and sites (native forest, teak). Analyses of measured soil properties with principal component analyses were similar for both plots: clay-silt content, sand content and soil <b>hygroscopic</b> water <b>coefficient</b> (SHC) were the leading components of the main axes. However, multiple linear regression models revealed a more complex picture. In the teak monoculture, ECa was correlated with soil texture (i. e., clay-silt content) and electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract (ECe) (R 2 = 0. 93), while in the native forest ECa was correlated with texture and residual soil water repellency (SWR) (R 2 = 0. 85). This finding indicates that SWR may {{play an important role}} in determining wetting {{patterns in}} tropical forests, with implications for resource distribution and gas emissions and may provide a basis for future investigations of soil-tree relationships...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present article aims to {{investigate}} the contribution of hygroscopic expansion of flax fibres to interfacial radial stresses and Interfacial Shear Strength (IFSS) of Maleic Anhydride grafted Polypropylene (MAPP) /Flax biocomposites. During manufacturing of thermoplastic biocomposites and storage at 50 % RH, a weight variation is observed, attributed to water content evolution within plant cell-walls. The <b>hygroscopic</b> radial expansion <b>coefficient</b> beta r (flax) of single flax fibres estimated by Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) observation is many orders of magnitude higher (beta(f,R) = 1. 14 s/Delta m) than thermal expansion (alpha(f,R) = 78 10 (- 6) epsilon/degrees C). Thus, its contribution {{to the development of}} residual stresses sigma(rad) during processing should be prevalent. A multiscale analysis of interfacial stress state and hygroscopic contribution is performed {{with the use of a}} cylindrical concentric model at microscopic scale and asymmetric composite laminates [0, 90 degrees] curvature generation at macroscopic scale. Similar radial stresses are obtained, while relevant values of mu (IFSS/sigma(rad)) approximate to 0. 46 are calculated. Therefore, the interfacial bond strength of natural fiber/polymer systems should be described by taking into account their hygroscopic behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Consistent {{with the}} results {{obtained}} for mock-ups A and B, for mock-ups D and F the horizontal shrinkage strain at the half-length of the panel (i.e., at strain gauge groups 6, 17 and 5, 7, 16, 18) is substantially larger—approximately a factor of two—than the horizontal shrinkage strain close to the cleated ends (i.e., at strain gauge groups 1, 11, 12, 22, 2, 9, 10, 13, 20, 21 and 3, 14). In contrast, for mock-ups C and E without the cleated ends these strains are approximately equal, which again illustrates the restraining effect by the cleated end on local deformations in the panel. In addition, the horizontal shrinkage strains recorded at {{the centre of the}} panel are similar for the mock-ups with and without cleated ends, which confirms the earlier hypothesis that at the half-length of the panel the restraining effect by the cleated end on the deformation behaviour is negligible. It can be further noticed that the spread in strain values measured on mock-ups E and F with veneer layers is considerably larger than for mock-ups C and D without veneer layers. Hence, the addition of veneer layers increases the variability in the local deformation behaviour of a panel. On average, the horizontal shrinkage strains for the panels with veneer layers are slightly larger than those for panels without veneer layers; this is caused {{by the fact that the}} <b>hygroscopic</b> expansion <b>coefficient</b> of the teak veneer layers in the tangential material direction (= horizontal panel direction) is larger than that of the oak substrate in the radial material direction (= horizontal panel direction). In accordance with the bi-layer model in Fig.  13 and Eq. (6), at the half-length of the panel this Type 2 shrinkage mechanism will induce a horizontal tensile stress in the veneer layer and a (small) horizontal compressive stress in the oak wood. This horizontal tensile stress indeed stimulates the development of vertical cracks in veneer layers, as regularly observed for historical cabinets [10]. These vertical cracks may subsequently deflect into delaminating cracks between the veneer layer and the substrate, with the chance of local spallation (i.e., flaking off) of the veneer layer. This failure mechanism is amplified by bending effects (warping) in the panel, see [30] for more details.|$|R
3000|$|For a Type 2 {{shrinkage}} analysis at the cleated ends, a plane-stress {{assumption is}} taken, {{in agreement with}} the limited thickness of the cleated ends and the boards in the out-of-plane direction. Hence, in the bi-layer model the stress response only depends on the material characteristics in the x-direction, see Eqs. (6) and (7). The elastic moduli and the <b>hygroscopic</b> expansion <b>coefficients</b> are again taken from Table  2, whereby the x-direction of the bi-layer is represented by the longitudinal direction of the oak wooden cleated end (= layer (1)), and by the radial direction of the oak wooden boards (= layer (2)). The effective height h^(2) across which the oak wooden board substantially contributes to the local hygral-mechanical equilibrium near the cleated end is assumed to be equal to the height h^(1) of the cleated end. Under a maximal drop in moisture content of m^(1)=m^(2)=- 0.038, Eq. (6) provides a tensile stress in the oak wooden board of σ _xx^(2)= 9.4 [...] N/mm^ 2. With this result, the total horizontal shrinkage strain in the layers from Eq. (3) is calculated as ϵ _xx=- 0.13 %, which is indeed comparable to the total final shrinkage strain measured for mock-up A on the cleated end, see Fig.  12 for the strain gauge group 1, 10, 14, 23. This agreement confirms that the above assumption for the effective height h^(2) of the oak wooden board is realistic. Note that the above tensile stress does not exceed the tensile strength of new oak wood of 21 [...] N/mm^ 2 (measured perpendicular to the grain direction), as reported in [28]; however, the stress has a magnitude relatively close to the reported tensile strength of 12 [...] N/mm^ 2 for seventeenth century oak wood, which, considering a realistic spread in the material properties for oak wood, thus potentially may lead to crack formation comparable to that observed near cleated ends of seventeenth century historical cabinets displayed in museums, see Fig.  2. Alternatively, this value for the tensile stress may reach the strength of the glue connecting the oak wooden boards, thereby leading to failure of a glue joint.|$|R
