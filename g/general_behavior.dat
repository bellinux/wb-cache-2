40|$|Color {{is one of}} the perch properties. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the <b>general</b> <b>behaviors</b> and perching behaviors in laying hens under different group size (stocking density), and to understand the perch color (black, white or brown) preference of hens during the night. A total of 390 Hyline Brown laying hens was used, and randomly allocated to three treatments: individual group (G 1), group of four hens (G 4), and group of eight hens (G 8), respectively. There were 30 replicates in each group. The hens in G 1, G 4 and G 8 groups were put into the test cages in which three colored perches were simultaneously provided and allowed for four days of habituation in the new cages. Hens behaviors were recorded using cameras with infrared light sources for the following periods: 8 : 00 to 10 : 00; 14 : 00 to 16 : 00; 19 : 00 to 21 : 00; 23 : 30 to 0 : 30 on the fifth day after transferring the birds into the test cages. The behaviors of hens in every time period were collected and analyzed, and hens positions on the test perches during mid-night were recorded. The results showed that, group size (stocking density) had significant effect on most of the <b>general</b> <b>behaviors</b> of laying hens except exploring behavior. There were great differences in most of the <b>general</b> <b>behaviors</b> during different time periods. In the preference test of perch color during night, the hens showed no clear preference for white, black or brown perches. For perching behaviors, perching time and frequency of transferring from one perch to another was higher on black perches than on white or brown perches in individual groups. In G 4 groups, the hens spent more time on white perches during daytime and more frequent transferring during night compared with black or brown perches. The frequency of jumping upon and down from white perches was higher in G 8 groups. It can be concluded that although the group sizes in the cage significantly affected most of the <b>general</b> <b>behaviors,</b> we found that no preference of perch color was shown by the caged laying hens in the different group sizes tested in this study...|$|R
25|$|When {{standing}} upright, the Aliens are bipedal in form, though {{depending on}} their host species, they will either adopt a more hunched stance, or remain quadrupedal when walking or sprinting. Their overall stance and <b>general</b> <b>behavior</b> {{is a result of}} the mixture of the DNA of the embryo and the host. They have a skeletal, biomechanical appearance and are usually colored in muted shades of black, gray or bronze. Their body heat matches the ambient temperature of the environment in which they are found, so they do not radiate heat, making them indistinguishable from their surroundings through thermal imaging. In most of the films, adult Aliens are capable of running and crawling along ceilings and walls. They have great physical strength, having been shown to be capable of breaking through welded steel doors in numbers.|$|E

Its food is sought both {{on the ground and}} in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources, such as acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruits and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks, bird-table food and rarely eggs and nestlings. Blue jays will sometimes cache food, though to what extent differs widely among individuals. Although seemingly contentious in their <b>general</b> <b>behavior,</b> Blue jays are frequently subservient to other medium-sized birds who visit bird-feeders. In Florida, Blue jays were dominated at feeders by Eastern gray squirrels, Florida scrub-jays, common grackles and red-headed woodpeckers, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.|$|E
25|$|Schumann {{resonance}} amplitude {{records show}} significant diurnal and seasonal variations which in general coincide {{in time with}} the times of the day-night transition (the terminator). This time-matching seems to support the suggestion of a significant influence of the day-night ionosphere asymmetry on Schumann resonance amplitudes. There are records showing almost clock-like accuracy of the diurnal amplitude changes. On the other hand, there are numerous days when Schumann Resonance amplitudes do not increase at sunrise or do not decrease at sunset. There are studies showing that the <b>general</b> <b>behavior</b> of Schumann resonance amplitude records can be recreated from diurnal and seasonal thunderstorm migration, without invoking ionospheric variations. Two recent independent theoretical {{studies have shown that the}} variations in Schumann resonance power related to the day-night transition are much smaller than those associated with the peaks of the global lightning activity, and therefore the global lightning activity plays a more important role in the variation of the Schumann resonance power.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between organizational citizenship <b>behavior</b> (OCB) and <b>general</b> citizenship <b>behavior</b> in the wider society. First, the article portrays a theoretical link between variants of <b>general</b> citizenship <b>behavior</b> (e. g., political participation, commu-nity involvement, general altruism, and faith in citizen involvement) and OCB. The potential contribution of such a relationship to public administration agencies and to society is also developed. Respondents were 200 employees and their supervisors from one of the major public health organizations in Israel. Path analysis using LISREL VIII supports the notion that contextual work attitudes mediate the effect of general citizenship on OCB. The prime implication is that the organization constitutes an important factor in determining whether <b>general</b> citizenship <b>behavior</b> will be transformed in the organization...|$|R

6000|$|April 25th.--Taking the {{deposition}} of sailors yesterday, {{in a case}} of alleged ill-usage by the officers of a vessel, one of the witnesses was an old seaman of sixty. In reply to some testimony of his, the captain said, [...] "You were the oldest man in the ship, and we honored you as such." [...] The mate also said that he never could have thought of striking an old man like that. Indeed, the poor old fellow had a kind of dignity and venerableness about him, though he confessed to having been drunk, and {{seems to have been a}} mischief-maker, what they call a sea-preacher,-- promoting discontent and grumbling. He must have been a very handsome man in his youth, having regular features of a noble and beautiful cast. His beard was gray; but his dark hair had hardly a streak of white, and was abundant all over his head. He was deaf, and seemed to sit in a kind of seclusion, unless when loudly questioned or appealed to. Once he broke forth from a deep silence thus, [...] "I defy any man!" [...] and then was silent again. It had a strange effect, this general defiance, which he meant, I suppose, in answer to some accusation that he thought was made against him. His <b>general</b> <b>behavior</b> throughout the examination was very decorous and proper; and he said he had never but once hitherto been before a consul, and that was in 1819, when a mate had ill-used him, and, [...] "being a young man then, I gave him a beating,"--whereupon his face gleamed with a quiet smile, like faint sunshine on an old ruin. [...] "By many a tempest has his beard been shook"; and I suppose he must soon go into a workhouse, and thence, shortly, to his grave. He is now in a hospital, having, as the surgeon certifies, some ribs fractured; but there does not appear to have been any violence used upon him aboard the ship of such a nature as to cause this injury, though he swears it was a blow from a rope, and nothing else. What struck me in the case was the respect and rank that his age seemed to give him, in the view of the officers; and how, as the captain's expression signified, it lifted him out of his low position, and made him a person to be honored. The dignity of his manner is perhaps partly owing to the ancient mariner, with his long experience, being an oracle among the forecastle men.|$|E

In order to overcome this shortcoming, we propose an incremental evolution method for neural networks based on cellular automata (CA) and a method of combining several evolved mod-ules by a rule-based approach. The incremental evolution method evolves the neural network by starting wi th simpler environment needed simple behavior and gradually making it more complex and <b>general</b> for complex <b>behaviors.</b> The multi-modules integration method can make complex and <b>general</b> <b>behaviors</b> by combining several mod-ules evolved or programmed to do simple be-havior.
