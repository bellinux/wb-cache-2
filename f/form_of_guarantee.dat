This thesis reviews and analyzes some of the business and legal issues that arise in connection with completion guarantees, as the completion guarantor assumes an increasingly pivotal role in entertainment financing transactions. The author discusses the current nature of North American entertainment financing and provides a brief history of completion guarantees. An analysis of the major forms of documentation involved in completion guarantee transactions follows. The obligations undertaken by the completion guarantor and their discharge are discussed, as are claims and reinsurance matters. A considerable portion of this thesis examines the position of the completion guarantor operating in Quebec and, in particular, the security rights enjoyed by the guarantor in this province. This thesis concludes by exploring the direction in which the completion guarantee industry is evolving, some extraterritorial considerations and the interplay between business and law in this field of endeavour...|$|E

40|$|The {{intangible}} {{nature of}} education is one contributor to consumers’ perception of risk prior to their purchase and consumption. This risk includes: functional risk, financial risk, temporal risk, physical risk, psychological risk and social risk. The presence of these risks often makes consumer evaluation prior to purchase and consumption difficult. Invoking a service guarantee is a platform available to enable higher educational institutions to minimize such risk perception so as to induce purchase. Specifically, service guarantee for higher education entails the application of teaching performance guarantee. This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> focuses on two important customer groups of higher educational institutions namely, students and faculty members, and focuses only on a specific performance aspect such as instructor’s performance. Thus, if students are dissatisfied with an instructor’s performance {{they are entitled to}} receive their money back. The imposition of such a teaching performance guarantee would implicate instructor’s accountability for certain aspects of their performance. It also establishes a mechanism to solicit feedback to better understand why and how instructors fail. Consequently, service performance guarantee creates a high level of customer focus and signals instructors’ care towards student...|$|E

That’s why the state administration requires such restriction of government power (state) with the aim to provide protection against the individual’s rights. State organizers in this case is the government as the main element that is caring, and as a public servants have an important role in realizing the welfare of its citizens/community. Every act of government organizer shall always be carried out in accordance with the applicable law, both written law and unwritten law. However, the general principles of governance still have important meanings and functions in the governance practice. Therefore, as a benchmark to assess whether the state organizers are appropriate in carrying out their actions within the rule of law, it can use the general principles of good governance...|$|E

These challenges are recognised for safety-critical systems such as medical devices, industrial process supervision workstations or autopilots. But even for systems where life is in not at stake, the need for properties like reliability, security, maintainability is becoming ever more pressing. Historically, a combination of methods derived from the purely technical fields of computing science, mathematics and statistics were used to provide some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the overall system will behave as prescribed. Human considerations were not totally overlooked from such approaches, but the increasingly intimate connection between the purely technical system and the humans surrounding it requires a more explicit consideration of psychological and social dimensions.

We outline an overview of the relevance of these questions in the workplace and emphasize the interest of an interdisciplinary approach to computer-based systems.

40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to studies on the challenges {{for the development of}} small rural communities that seek to reconcile the development of agricultural and non agricultural activities as an important instrument to combat rural poverty, the instability of farm incomes and rural depopulation. The survey was conducted with ranchers installed on the Mogi Guaçu river, located in the town of Barrinha, SP, which has as a peculiar characteristic to be a dormitory town of day laborers who work in sugar cane plantations in the region of Ribeirão Preto / SP. The community is made up of ranches, housing and local production units, where various economic activities - agricultural and non agricultural ones- take place and interact among themselves and with local associations. The theoretical references are based on authors who discuss conditions of formation of the "new Brazilian rural" and "multi-activity in the field", explaining the issue from a paradox between the presence of large estates and monoculture, on one hand, and, on the other hand, of small family farms that develop these activities to remain in the field.

40|$|The {{role that}} urban farming {{plays in the}} food supply of cities and towns to {{compliment}} rural agriculture is increasingly gaining traction. In Zimbabwe, urban agriculture has equally become an important contributor of urban food, particularly for low income households. Urban agriculture is increasingly being viewed as a viable measure to ameliorate urban food insecurity. In spite of the important role it serves in the urban landscape, it is yet to attain political legitimacy and more importantly to gain recognition from the formal financial economy. This in turn has limited the contribution that the urban agriculture can make towards poverty alleviation and inequality for the urban poor. Access to finance and lines of credit for the urban poor can {{have a significant impact}} towards not only their agricultural productivity but also their ability to weather economic shocks. This study therefore sought to investigate factors that limit access of small scale urban farmers to agricultural microcredit. The findings of this study are derived from qualitative and quantitative data collected from small scale urban farmers in Snake Park and key informant interviews conducted in Harare, Zimbabwe. The study establishes that the lack of information on credit opportunities, loan apathy and too high interest rates were some of the reasons divulged by farmers in not seeking credit from financial institutions. The results reveal that married women have an added constraint to accessing finance by virtue of husband being head of the house, mean that they hold power to cede assets as collateral. The findings from the financial institution indicated that though the majority of firms focused on large scale commercial farming ventures, some did offer microcredit for small scale urban farmers. The results also showed that though collateral facilitated access to credit and finance for urban agriculture, proven business record, group solidarity (a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee)</b> and character were equally important. The study recommends amongst others that farmers form groups and embark on savings schemes. Added to this, bankers and farmer associations need to meet to arrive at realistic forms of security for small loans...|$|E
