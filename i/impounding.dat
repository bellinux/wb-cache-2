5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, <b>impounding</b> small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava {{traveled}} into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to a depth of over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for <b>impounding</b> water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, <b>impounding</b> it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

5|$|A {{site was}} first {{identified}} {{for the power}} plant in the 1970s when a study was carried {{out on the water}} resources of the Albors Mountains by the Belgian firm Traksionel. Several sites for dams were identified including Siah Bisheh as a potential place for a pumped-storage power plant. In 1975, a feasibility report on the Siah Bisheh project was submitted to the Ministry of Energy. The Albors Mountains study concluded in 1977 and geologic studies began in 1978 but were halted in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1983, Lahmeyer International was contracted to create designs for Phase II (underground excavation) which were completed in 1985, the same year construction on the dam's diversion tunnels began. Further designs for Phase I (superstructures) were developed and construction continued until 1992 when a lack of funding halted the project once again. Construction would not commence again until 2001. In 2002 and 2003, contracts for the dams and power plant were awarded and construction continued. The project was 90 percent complete as of April 2012. Both the upper and lower reservoir were complete and had finished <b>impounding</b> in January 2013. The first of four generators was commissioned in May 2013 and the remaining were operational by 1 September 2015.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s it was {{proposed}} that the Craig-goch reservoir should be substantially increased in size with a new and higher downstream dam together with another dam to the north-west, <b>impounding</b> water that would otherwise have flowed down the Ystwyth valley. This scheme would have created a huge reservoir dwarfing all others in Mid Wales, and flooding miles of wild upland valleys. The proposals were eventually abandoned {{in the face of}} reducing projections for industrial water demand and an increasing awareness of the environmental issues that such an expansion might create.|$|E
25|$|The Lake of the Ozarks, Pomme de Terre Lake, and Truman Lake in the {{northern}} Ozarks were formed by <b>impounding</b> the Osage River and its tributary the Pomme de Terre River in 1931, 1961 and 1979 respectively. Grand Lake in northeast Oklahoma was created in 1940. Stockton Lake was formed by damming the Sac River {{near the city of}} Stockton, Missouri in 1969 and supplements the water supply of Springfield in nearby Greene County. Most of the dams were built for the dual purpose of flood control and hydropower generation.|$|E
25|$|As one {{contemporary}} points out, {{there were}} economic benefits with the internment of Japanese Canadians. Specifically, white fishermen directly benefited {{due to the}} <b>impounding</b> of all Japanese-Canadian owned fishing boats. Fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half {{of all of the}} licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also that every year thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the Japanese from salmon fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten percent a year, until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. The fact that any Japanese Canadians were still fishing in British Columbia at the outset of World War II is amazing due to the pressure they faced from the province, country, and other fishermen. Yet the reason the government gave for <b>impounding</b> the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a horrific coastal attack on British Columbia.|$|E

50|$|The {{river is}} <b>impounded</b> in six locations. The {{first is the}} Niagara Dam {{just south of the}} City of Roanoke in Roanoke County {{adjacent}} to the town of Vinton. It was constructed in 1906 to supply power for the Roanoke Electric Car streetcar system, and is currently owned and operated by Appalachian Power. It is then <b>impounded</b> twice in succession in the Piedmont of southwestern Virginia downstream from Roanoke to form the Smith Mountain Lake and Leesville Lake reservoirs. Farther downstream in southern along the North Carolina border, the river is <b>impounded</b> by the John H. Kerr Dam to form the expansive Kerr Lake. In northeastern North Carolina, 3 mi west of Roanoke Rapids, the river is <b>impounded</b> to form the Lake Gaston reservoir, and is <b>impounded</b> a final time to form Roanoke Rapids Lake.|$|R

25|$|By the 1920s, the Orange/Anaheim/Villa Park {{area was}} a prospering {{agricultural}} region that depended on {{water from the}} Santa Ana River and Santiago Creek. Santiago Creek would unleash seasonal floods {{in the winter and}} then while becoming a trickle or completely dry in the summer, making irrigation difficult. The Serrano Irrigation District was formed in 1928, and partnered with the Irvine Company and the Carpenter Irrigation District of El Modena, for the construction of Santiago Dam, <b>impounding</b> Lake Irvine. Construction work begun in 1929 and the dam was completed in 1931. The agricultural areas in the creek's lower watershed were replaced by residential and commercial development in the Post-WWII era, but the city of Villa Park and some of the city of Orange still receive their water from Irvine Lake.|$|E

This project, known as ACWHEP (Aliso Creek Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project) was intended to provide water to [...] of former riparian areas now several feet higher than the eroded channel of the creek. It was conceived and jointly funded by the county and the Mission Viejo Company. The dam was also supposed to control further erosion downstream. Due to faulty design, however, the dam failed to prevent erosion, which has continued to undermine structures throughout the canyon. The grouted riprap structure is about [...] high and [...] long, and aside from <b>impounding</b> water, captures debris and temporarily controls wet season flows.

500|$|Some of {{the water}} in the Little Butte Creek {{watershed}} is diverted to irrigate the Rogue Valley and to supplement Bear Creek, both roughly [...] to the southwest. In the late 19th century, a large number of orchards were planted near Ashland. They were initially irrigated by Bear Creek; however, there was not enough water to satisfy the orchards' needs. In 1898, the Fish Lake Water Company was established to solve the problem. The company proposed the enlargement of Fourmile and Fish lakes by <b>impounding</b> Fourmile Creek and North Fork Little Butte Creek, respectively, and connecting them via the Cascade Canal. Construction of the temporary Fish Lake Dam began in 1902. Around this time, construction of the Joint System Canal to the west also began. Construction of Fourmile Lake Dam started in 1906, along with the Cascade Canal. A network of other small canals, such as Hopkins Canal and the Medford Canal, were also built in the Rogue Valley around this time. Fish Lake Dam was completed in 1908, creating the [...] reservoir.|$|E
500|$|The already troubled {{relations}} with Japanese merchants in Tayouan {{took a turn}} for the worse in 1628 when tensions boiled over. The merchants, who had been trading in Taiwan long before the Dutch colony was established, refused to pay Dutch tolls levied for conducting business in the area, which they saw as unfair. Nuyts exacted revenge on the same Hamada Yahei who he blamed for causing the failure of the Japanese embassy by <b>impounding</b> his ships and weapons until the tolls were paid. However, the Japanese were still not inclined to pay taxes, and the affair came to a head when Hamada took Nuyts hostage at knifepoint in his own office. Hamada's demands were for the return of their ships and property, and for safe passage to return to Japan. These requests were granted by the Council of Formosa (the ruling body of Dutch Formosa), and Nuyts' son Laurens was taken back to Japan as one of six Dutch hostages. Laurens died in Omura prison on 29 December 1631. During the Japanese era in Taiwan (1895–1945), school history textbooks retold the hostage-taking as the , portraying the Dutchman as a [...] "typical arrogant western bully who slighted Japanese trading rights and trod on the rights of the native inhabitants".|$|E
