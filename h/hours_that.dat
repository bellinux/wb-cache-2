In today's currency, damages would be between $ and $.|$|E

The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E

In the <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> preceded the landing, twelve Boeing B-17 and six Vickers Wellington equipped with radar jamming devices flew back and forth along the coast in the Siracusa-Licata sector; between 21:00 and 21:30, 55 Wellingtons of 205th Group carried out a diversionary bombing of the port and airport of Syracuse, causing a number of civilian and military casualties, including {{the commander of the}} Italian naval base, Commander Giuseppe Giannotti. 280 puppets dressed in paratrooper uniforms were launched north of the landing area, in order to deceive the Italian defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{hours of}} sale for {{on-premises}} consumption are regulated by local ordinance, and closing times vary by town. Atlantic City {{does not have}} closing hours, and alcohol {{can be purchased at}} its casinos and local bars 24 hours a day. With the exception of Newark and Jersey City, the law forbids hard liquor packaged goods sales before 9 am and after 10 pm any day of the week. This can be restricted further by local ordinance. Liquor stores may sell beer and wine during any <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> on-premises sales are allowed.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{traveled}} east-northeastward paralleling the Gulf Coast of the United States, {{and eventually}} made landfall on the Florida panhandle early on June 29. It weakened slightly as it traversed inland, {{and entered the}} Atlantic Ocean just offshore Georgia during the morning. At this point, the storm attained its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h), though it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone within the six <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> followed. Late during the day, the extratropical storm reached New Jersey, and entered Maine on June 30. The 2003 reanalysis made only minor adjustments to the storm's intensity and track created by Partagás and Diaz, which included moving the point of landfall westward and increasing windspeeds on June 29 based on readings received in Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
