40|$|Carbon {{black and}} iron black (FeaO 4) are black {{pigments}} {{commonly used in}} the cosmetic industry. Due to its hydrophobic character, carbon black has poor dispersibility in water, and iron black, due to its ferro-mag-netic character, is not readily dispersible in any liquid. In order to solve these problems the authors investi-gated the possibility of synthesizing LOWER TITANIUM OXIDES and using them as a black pigment IN COSMETICS. The general formula of the lower titanium oxide is TinO•n- • in which n can be any positive in-teger. When n is small, the resultant compound is bluish-black. As n increases, the compound becomes gray. The lower titanium oxide most suitable for cosmetics was obtained by calcining a mixture of a titanium dioxide pigment and a metallic titanium powder in a vacuum electric furnace.

40|$|In {{the present}} scenario, photo-imaging in any {{documentation}} and records has become a {{part and parcel of}} life across the world today. It is performed by Xerox machine that are suspected to emit volatile organic compounds, toner dust as well as other chemicals such as styrene, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> <b>black</b> carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon etc. These may become the potential source of pollutant gases. Thereby, it also represents a risk of health hazards of the employees and general public. Owing to extensive application of photocopier on daily basis, the present study was undertaken to investigate the risk assessment of Xerox toner dust on the health of operators in certain areas of Guwahati where the machines are used in an extensive way. The present work was executed through case studies by conducting a survey on individual interview with standard questionnaire. The result was analyzed on the basis of initial, short term and long term exposure during machine operation. Out of 150 studied cases, 88 cases were recorded as affected along with 62 normal cases. Middle age group i. e., 25 - 45 years were affected mostly. Symptoms were generally nausea, backbone pain, eye irritation, loss of hair, running of noses in initial exposure whereas headache, dizziness, itching of body, skin loss of palm, pharyngeal mucosa, respiratory problem and asthma like cough were recorded in the individuals exposed to long term machine operation. Some striking cases revealed gastric ulcer and allergic rhinitis and obstructive respiratory disease with ‘Lung overloading ’ that might be caused from photo copier dust. Depending on the photo copier utility as “urgent need for documentation ” in the present day as well as concern with the risk of hazardous impact on public health, a thorough investigation both in experimentation and a detailed survey works are essentially required in this line, which may lead to establish some unwanted physical disorders...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{chemistry}} basically {{deals with}} rational {{design and synthesis}} of new solids exhibiting various functional properties. A sound knowledge of crystal structures and chemical bonding is needed to understand the properties of materials. Space group, cell parameters and atomic positions provide a basic crystallographic description of the structure. Crystal structure could be described in a detailed way in terms of close packing of anions and occupancy of cations in different coordination sites. The coordination polyhedra and their interconnectivity bring out the interrelationships between different structures and the properties exhibited. Transition metals (TMs) are d-block elements which occupy groups 3 - 12 in Periodic Table. IUPAC defines a TM as ‘an element whose atoms have partially filled d-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d-shell’. The partially filled d-shell in TMs {{plays an important role}} in various chemical and physical properties of TMs. Although TM cations can form compounds with different anions, most of the TM containing compounds are metal oxides due to the large free energies for formation of oxides. Binary TM oxides adopt different kinds of structures among which rock salt (e. g. NiO), rutile (e. g. TiO 2), and corundum (e. g. Cr 2 O 3) are most common. Ternary TM oxides are also known to form in variety of structures with the perovskite (e. g. BaTiO 3), and the spinel (e. g. MgFe 2 O 4) structures being well known. TM oxides exhibit a broad range of electronic and magnetic properties. TM oxides, at one end, display metallic behavior (e. g. ReO 3, RuO 2, LaNiO 3) due to the delocalized electrons and at other end, show insulating behavior (e. g. NiO) due to the localized electrons. In between, TM oxides have semiconducting properties involving either the hopping of carriers (e. g. partially reduced TiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, WO 3 and so on) or the electron excitation from the valence band to the conduction band (e. g. SnO 2). TM oxides are known to have diverse magnetic properties: diamagnetic (e. g. TiO 2, ZrO 2), paramagnetic (e. g. VO 2, NbO 2), ferromagnetic (e. g. CrO 2, La 0. 67 Ca 0. 33 MnO 3), ferrimagnetic (e. g. Fe 3 O 4, MnFe 2 O 4) and antiferromagnetic (e. g. NiO, LaCrO 3). TM oxides with partially filled 3 d-shell are expected to be ‘metallic’ according to Bloch-Wilson theory, but in practice they are Mott insulators (localized 3 d electrons) because of correlation energy (U) involved in the transfer of d-electrons between adjacent sites. Certain TM oxides also show insulator-metal (I-M) transitions induced by change of temperature, pressure or composition. For example, VO 2 and Ba 2 IrO 4 are known for their temperature and pressure induced I-M transitions, respectively. La 1 -xSrxCoO 3 becomes metal at a particular Sr concentration being one of the examples for composition-dependent I-M transition. TM oxides are usually synthesized by conventional ceramic method in which stoichiometric mixture of starting materials is reacted at elevated temperatures. Multiple prolonged heating with intermittent grindings in ceramic method generally results in thermodynamically controlled products. The metastable phases which are of interest may not be obtained by ceramic method. Chimie douce/soft chemistry methods are generally adopted to stabilize the metastable phases. The guiding principle behind the chimie douce is to have kinetic control (rather than thermodynamic control) to realize metastable phases. Accordingly, metastable derivatives are obtained by choosing appropriate precursors, or adopting sol-gel and molten flux or ion exchange/intercalation methods. The present thesis is devoted to an investigation of transition metal oxides towards development of functional materials exhibiting visible light absorption/emission and lithium insertion/extraction for cathode materials in lithium ion battery. TM oxides find application as photovoltaic materials, luminescent emission materials, photocatalysts, light absorption/pigment materials and so on, based on their optical properties. Ferroelectric TM oxides with perovskite structure [Green coloured (KNbO 3) 1 -x (BaNi 1 / 2 Nb 1 / 2 O 3 -δ) x] are studied currently as photovoltaic materials which show high open circuit voltage (Voc = 3. 5 V) despite very low short circuit current (Vsc = 40 nA cm- 2). TM oxides are also known to exhibit photoluminescent emission which could be due to the doping activator ions (e. g. MnII doped Zn 2 GeO 4) or TM oxide (e. g. CaWO 4) itself being self-activator. While the green and red emissions are common for TM oxides, blue emission is rare (e. g. Ar+ irradiated SrTiO 3 is a blue emitter). Coloured TM oxides with band gap in visible region are employed as photocatalysts for solar water splitting (e. g. yellow BiVO 4, yellow Ag 3 PO 4, yellow TaON, red Fe 2 O 3) and photo-oxidation of organic pollutants (e. g. TiO 2 -xNx and CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12). The coloured TM oxides also find application as pigments from early times, for example, Egyptian blue (CaCuSi 4 O 10), Han blue (BaCuSi 4 O 10), Han purple (BaCuSi 2 O 6), Malachite green (Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2), Ochre red (Fe 2 O 3) and many others. A list of pigments based on TM oxides is given in Table 1. Pigment materials are applied as colouring materials in inks, dyes, paints, plastics, ceramics glazers, enamels and textiles. Table 1.

Though d-d transitions are parity forbidden, the selection rules get relaxed due to different reasons such as symmetry reduction (due to distortion) and vibronic couplings. The colour of the TM oxides is influenced mainly by two factors (i) oxidation state of TM ion present and (ii) ligand field around the TM ion produced by anion geometry. In order to develop new pigment oxides, our strategy was to choose colourless metal oxides having unusual (five coordinated geometry) or irregular/distorted (distorted octahedral/tetrahedral) coordination geometries around metal ion and produce coloured oxides by substituting 3 d-TM ions at the metal ion site. We made a detailed study on the origin of the colour and pigment quality of the resulting coloured oxides. In the present thesis, which has two parts, the first part (Part 1) discusses the development of 3 d-TM ion substituted coloured oxides with potential for pigment applications. Chapter 1. 1 describes the purple inorganic pigment, YGa 1 -xMnxO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 10), based on the hexagonal YGaO 3. The metastable series of oxides were prepared by a sol-gel technique where the dried gels, obtained from aqueous solutions of metal nitrates-citric acid mixtures, were calcined for a short duration in preheated furnace around 850 °C/ 10 mins. The purple colour of the oxides arises from the specific trigonal bipyramidal ligand field around MnIII that obtains in the YGaO 3 host. Other hexagonal RGaO 3 hosts for R = Lu, Tm and Ho substituted with MnIII also produce similar purple coloured materials. In Chapter 1. 2, we present a study on substitution of 3 d-TM ions in LiMgBO 3 host [where Mg(II) has a trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) oxygen coordination) ]. We find that single-phase materials are formed for LiMg 1 -xCo(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 1. 0), LiMg 1 -xNi(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1), LiMg 1 -xCu(II) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1) and also Li 1 -xMg 1 -xFe(III) xBO 3 (0 < x ≤ 0. 1) of which the Co(II) and Ni(II) derivatives are strongly coloured, purple-blue and beige-red respectively, thus identifying TBP CoO 5 and NiO 5 as the new chromophores for these colours. Chapter 1. 3 describes the synthesis, crystal structures and optical absorption spectra/colours of 3 d-TM substituted α-LiZnBO 3 derivatives: α-LiZn 1 -xMIIxBO 3 [MII = CoII (0 < x < 0. 50), NiII (0 < x ≤ 0. 05) and CuII (0 < x 0. 10) ] and α-Li 1 +xZn 1 - 2 xMIIIxBO 3 [MIII = MnIII (0 < x ≤ 0. 10) and FeIII (0 < x 0. 25) ]. The crystal structure of the host α-LiZnBO 3, which is both disordered and distorted with respect to Li and Zn occupancies and coordination geometries, is largely retained in the derivatives, giving rise to unique colours [blue for CoII, magenta for NiII and violet for CuII], that could be of significance for the development of new, inexpensive and environmentally-benevolent pigment materials, especially for the blue colour. Accordingly, the work indentifies distorted tetrahedral MO 4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu) (together with a long M-O bond that gives a trigonal bipyramidal geometry) structural units as the new chromophores for the blue, magenta and violet colours respectively, in the α-LiZnBO 3 host. In Chapter 1. 4, we describe the synthesis, crystal structures and optical absorption spectra of 3 d-TM substituted spiroffite derivatives, Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu; 0 < x ≤ 1. 0). The oxides are readily synthesized by solid state reaction of stoichiometric mixtures of the constituent binaries at 620 °C/ 12 h. Rietveld refinement of the crystal structures from powder XRD data shows that the Zn/MO 6 octahedra are strongly distorted, as in the parent Zn 2 Te 3 O 8 structure, consisting of five relatively short Zn/MII – O bonds (1. 898 – 2. 236 Å) and one longer Zn/MII– O bond (2. 356 – 2. 519 Å). We have interpreted the unique colors and the optical absorption/diffuse reflectance spectra of Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 in the visible, in terms of the observed/irregular coordination geometry of the Zn/MII – O chromophores. We could not however prepare the fully-substituted M 2 Te 3 O 8 (MII = Co, Ni, Cu) by the direct solid state reaction method. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling of the electronic structure of both the parent and the transition metal substituted derivatives provides new insights into the bonding and the role of transition metals toward the origin of color in these materials. We believe that transition metal substituted spiroffites Zn 2 -xMxTe 3 O 8 reported here suggest new directions for the development of colored inorganic materials/pigments featuring irregular/distorted oxygen coordination polyhedra around transition metal ions. Red coloured materials are rare in nature. Li 2 MnO 3 is a unique oxide with an unusual red colour imparted by MnIV ions. Chapter 1. 5 describes a detailed experimental investigation of Li 2 MnO 3 together with other related MnIV oxides that probes the red colour of Li 2 MnO 3 as well as its photoluminescence. Optical absorption spectra reveal a strong band gap absorption with a sharp edge at ~ 610 nm and a transparent region between ~ 610 and ~ 650 nm that causes the red colour of Li 2 MnO 3 samples. Octahedral MnIV ligand field transitions, corresponding to both MnIV at ideal sites and MnIV displaced to Li sites in the rock salt based layered structure of Li 2 MnO 3, are observed in the excitation spectra of Li 2 MnO 3 samples. Optical excitation at the ligand field transition energies produces tunable emission in the red-yellow-green region, rendering Li 2 MnO 3 a unique MnIV oxide. The honeycomb ordered [LiMn 6] units in the structure likely causes both the absorption and photoluminescence properties of Li 2 MnO 3. Lithium containing TM oxides with rock salt related structure are being investigated extensively for application as next generation cathode materials for Lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Recent research is focused on lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) which are solid solutions between Li 2 MO 3 (where M = Ti, Mn and Ru) and LiMO 2 (where M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). LLOs have excess lithium in the TM layer in addition to lithium in lithium layer of rock salt derived structure. LLOs have gained attention because of their higher discharge capacity in the range of ~ 250 mAhg- 1. While most of the LLOs investigated so far contain 3 d-TM ions (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), recently there has been an interest in the study of the role of ruthenium in addition to 3 d-TM ions. We have investigated ruthenium containing LLOs with a view to probe (i) the role of ruthenium and (ii) the concentration of excess lithium in the TM layers in producing higher discharge capacities. The results are discussed in the Part 2 of the thesis. Li 5 NiMnRuO 8 (Li[Li 0. 25 Ni 0. 25 Mn 0. 25 Ru 0. 25]O 2) form in the Li 2 RuO 3 crystal structure. Electrochemical studies indicate that the Co-containing oxides exhibit a higher initial discharge capacity (for e. g. ~ 180 mAhg- 1 for Li 4 CoRuO 6) as well as a higher reversible discharge capacity (~ 130 mAhg- 1 for Li 4 CoRuO 6) compared to the corresponding Ni-analogs. Participation of oxide ions (higher oxidation state of Ru) in the redox process could explain the higher discharge capacity during the first cycle. Reduced capacity (capacity fade) during the subsequent cycles could arise from the oxygen evolution due to the redox process (2 O 2 - → 2 O- → O 2), which is not reversible. The present work shows that ruthenium incorporation in rock salt layered oxides along with Co/Ni appears to give a beneficial effect in producing a higher discharge capacity. In addition, the compounds crystallizing with the R- 3 m structure (related to LiCoO 2) appear to give a better reversible capacity than the compounds crystallizing in the C 2 /c structures (Li 2 TiO 3 and Li 2 RuO 3) ...|$|E

After the incubation period the mesenchymal stem cells were evaluated by internalization of the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran by Prussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detection by Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. RESULTS: mesenchymal stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to its low presence detected within cells. Mesenchymal stem cells labeled with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the mesenchymal stem cells labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferate over seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosis is low compared to the percentage of live cells over the three days. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the use of poly-L-lysine complexed with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran provides better internalization of these superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles in mesenchymal stem cells Thus, we demonstrated that this type of labeling is not cytotoxic to the mesenchymal stem cells, since the viability and apoptosis assays showed that the cells remain alive and proliferating. The efficiency of this type of labeling in mesenchymal stem cells can provide non-invasive methods for monitoring these cells in vivo...|$|R

The present work proposes to characterize natural, natural processed and synthetic pigments by comparing phase and elemental compositions. The results reveal differences in Fe, Si, K and Al total content according to their origin and fabrication process and reveal intentional addition of white charges like carbonates. Elements like Zr, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ca and Zn are present in all categories. Under optical microscopy, some samples of processed natural pigments do not exhibit optical activity, thus revealing mixtures with synthetic pigments, while natural pigments present a strong birefringence colorless due to optically active minerals.
