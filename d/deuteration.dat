50|$|Hydrogen and {{deuterium}} nuclei are grossly {{different in}} their magnetic properties. Thus {{it is possible}} to distinguish between them by NMR spectroscopy. Deuterons will not be observed in a 1H NMR spectrum and conversely, protons will not be observed in a 2H NMR spectrum. Where small signals are observed in a 1H NMR spectrum of a highly deuterated sample, these are referred to as residual signals. They can be used to calculate the level of <b>deuteration</b> in a molecule. Analogous signals are not observed in 2H NMR spectra because of the low sensitivity of this technique compared to the 1H analysis. Deuterons typically exhibit very similar chemical shifts to their analogous protons. Analysis via 13C NMR spectroscopy is also possible: the different spin values of hydrogen (1/2) and deuterium (1) gives rise to different splitting multiplicities. NMR spectroscopy can be used to determine site-specific <b>deuteration</b> of molecules.|$|E
5000|$|Determining site {{specific}} <b>deuteration</b> is via {{mass spectrometry}} {{is more complicated}} than using NMR spectroscopy. For example, the location and relative amount of deuterium exchange along the peptide backbone can be determined roughly by subjecting the protein to proteolysis after the exchange reaction has been quenched. Individual peptides are then analyzed for overall <b>deuteration</b> of each peptide fragment. Using this technique the resolution of deuterium exchange is determined {{by the size of the}} peptides produced during digestion. [...] Pepsin, an acid protease, is commonly used for proteolysis, as the quench pH must be maintained during the proteolytic reaction. To minimize the back-exchange, proteolysis and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis must be done as quickly as possible. HPLC separation of the peptic digest is often carried out at low temperature just prior to electrospray mass spectrometry to minimize back-exchange. More recently, UPLC has been used due to its superior separation capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Rate of ESIPT {{process may}} slow down by {{deuterium}} substitution of hydrogen that is transferred in ESIPT, because the <b>deuteration</b> increases only {{mass of the}} transferred significantly while do not change electrostatic potential in the molecule substantially. However the amount of rate change {{may lie in the}} range of 1~50, depending on the shape and size of potential energy surfaces of the molecule.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional approaches particular in protein NMR, {{in which the}} broad lines associated with protons effectively relegate this nucleus to mixing of magnetization, recent developments of hardware (very fast MAS) and reduction of dipolar interactions by <b>deuteration</b> have made protons as versatile {{as they are in}} solution NMR. This includes spectral dispersion in multi-dimensional experiments as well as structurally valuable restraints and parameters important for studying the materials' dynamics.|$|E
50|$|The {{deuterium}} nucleus {{is twice}} as heavy as the hydrogen nucleus because it contains a neutron {{as well as a}} proton. Thus a molecules that contains some deuterium will be heavier than one that contains all hydrogen. As a protein is increasingly deuterated, the molecular mass increases correspondingly. Detecting the change in the mass of a protein upon <b>deuteration</b> was made possible by modern protein mass spectrometry, first reported in 1991 by Katta and Chait.|$|E
50|$|A further {{complication}} in {{the case}} of neutron scattering from hydrogenous materials is the strong incoherent scattering of hydrogen (80.27(6) barn). This leads to a very high background in neutron diffraction experiments, and may make structural investigations impossible. A common solution is <b>deuteration,</b> i.e., replacing the 1-H atoms in the sample with deuterium (2-H). The incoherent scattering length of deuterium is much smaller (2.05(3) barn) making structural investigations significantly easier. However, in some systems, replacing hydrogen with deuterium may alter the structural and dynamic properties of interest.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that <b>deuteration</b> changes the heats of {{adsorption}} and the boiling and freezing points of molecules (boiling points: 100.0 °C for H2O vs. 101.42 °C for D2O; melting points: 0.0 °C for H2O, 3.82 °C for D2O), pKa (i.e., dissociation constant: 9.71x10−15 for H2O vs. 1.95x10−15 for D2O, cf. heavy water) {{and the strength}} of hydrogen bonding.

50|$|In the 1960s, {{the method}} became {{increasingly}} {{important in the}} study of biological macromolecules in solution as it allowed one to get low-resolution structural information on the overall shape and internal structure in the absence of crystals. A breakthrough in SAXS and SANS experiments came in the 1970s, thanks to the availability of synchrotron radiation and neutron sources, the latter paving the way for contrast variation by solvent exchange of H2O for D2O and specific <b>deuteration</b> methods. It was realised that scattering studies on solution provide, at a minimal investment of time and effort, useful insights into the structure of non-crystalline biochemical systems. Moreover, SAXS/SANS also made possible real time investigations of intermolecular interactions, including assembly and large-scale conformational changes in macromolecular assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a recent}} but highly {{controversial}} interpretation, {{it has also}} been speculated that olfactory receptors might really sense various vibrational energy-levels of a molecule rather than structural motifs via quantum coherence mechanisms. As evidence {{it has been shown that}} flies can differentiate between two odor molecules which only differ in hydrogen isotope (which will drastically change vibrational energy levels of the molecule). Not only could the flies distinguish between the deuterated and non-deuterated forms of an odorant, they could generalise the property of [...] "deuteratedness" [...] to other novel molecules. In addition, they generalised the learned avoidance behaviour to molecules which were not deuterated but did share a significant vibration stretch with the deuterated molecules, a fact which the differential physics of <b>deuteration</b> (below) has difficulty in accounting for.|$|E
50|$|In a {{scattering}} experiment, {{a solution of}} macromolecules is exposed to X-rays (with wavelength λ typically around 0.15 nm) or thermal neutrons (λ≈0.5 nm). The scattered intensity I(s) is recorded {{as a function of}} momentum transfer s (s=4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the angle between the incident and scattered radiation). From the intensity of the solution the scattering from only the solvent is subtracted. The random positions and orientations of particles result in an isotropic intensity distribution which, for monodisperse non-interacting particles, is proportional to the scattering from a single particle averaged over all orientations. The net particle scattering is proportional to the squared difference in scattering length density (electron density for X-rays and nuclear/spin density for neutrons) between particle and solvent - the so-called contrast. The contrast can be varied in neutron scattering using H2O/D2O mixtures or selective <b>deuteration</b> to yield additional information. The information content of SAS data is illustrated here in the figure on the right, which shows X-ray scattering patterns from proteins with different folds and molecular masses. At low angles (2-3 nm resolution) the curves are rapidly decaying functions of s essentially determined by the particle shape, which clearly differ. At medium resolution (2 to 0.5 nm) the differences are already less pronounced and above 0.5 nm resolution all curves are very similar. SAS thus contains information about the gross structural features - shape, quaternary and tertiary structure - but is not suitable for the analysis of the atomic structure.|$|E

Separate the entire CROP domain into four different peptide units, including the entire CROP domain as B1 (residues 1834-2366), as well as fragments of the CROP domain being B2 (residues 1834-2101), B3 (residues 1949-2275), and B4 (residues 2102-2366). Western Blot analysis of these peptides reinforce that antibody bezlotoxumab does indeed recognize a specific epitope on toxin TcdB and will have high affinity for that region. There lack of interaction between the GTD domain and bezlotoxumab, {{as well as the}} apparent interaction in B1, which is representative of the entire CROP domain. Bezlotoxumab specifically inhibits the CROP domain of TcdB. B2 andB3 have an interaction between bezlotoxumab and those individual peptide regions, or possibly the overlapping residues region between the two. B4 fragment does not interact with the specific portion of the CROP domain. The kinetics of bezlotxumab binding to TcdB and its various fragments were determine by surface plasmon resonance. By HDX-MS analysis a method that relies on the measurement and comparison of the degree of deuterium incorporation by an antigen following incubation in D2O in absence and presence of antibody. Characterization of peptide B1 as full CROP domain of TcdB by HDX-MS reveal that fragment corresponding to residues 1902-1914, 2021-2025, 2033-2038 and 2091-2096 appear to have a strong interaction with bezlotoxumab, as denoted by the minimal levels of <b>deuteration.</b> Indeed all of these region are present within the B2.

Because of their slow formation, interstellar ices are chemically heterogeneous and show an increase of their deuterium fractionation towards the surface. The differentiation of the <b>deuteration</b> in ices induces an evolution of the <b>deuteration</b> within protostellar envelopes. The warm inner region is poorly deuterated because it includes the whole molecular content of ices while the <b>deuteration</b> predicted in the cold external envelope scales with the highly deuterated surface of ices.
