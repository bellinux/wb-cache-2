25|$|The nanocellulose fibrils may be {{isolated}} from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to high shear forces, ripping the larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure <b>homogenizers,</b> ultrasonic <b>homogenizers,</b> grinders or microfluidizers can be used. The <b>homogenizers</b> are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the nanosized fibrils.

Purpose of the work: {{development and}} investigation of devices and methods which {{make it possible}} to reduce the power consumption of the dispersion process in slit <b>homogenizers</b> without deteriorating the quality of the product. A model is proposed for the interchannel breaking of fat particles of the milk. The dispersion process is mathematically discribed. The proposed dependences and recommendations permit optimization of the dispersion process during the design work and operation of the <b>homogenizers.</b> This will bring about a rational utilization of the energy resources.

50|$|Many {{variations}} for artificial cell {{preparation and}} encapsulation have been developed. Typically, vesicles {{such as a}} nanoparticle, polymersome or liposome are synthesized.

50|$|In {{the field}} of optics, a <b>homogenizer</b> is an optical device that makes the light beam from a laser or lamp source more uniform in its {{intensity}} across its cross-section to enable the light source {{to provide a more}} uniform illumination on a surface. Use of a <b>homogenizer</b> in an illumination system is important in consumer applications such as light projectors for movies and industrial applications such as imaging equipment for microlithography for production of semiconductor microchips. Such homogenizers are also called beam homogenizers or beam uniformizers. The main principle in their design approach is to divide the light beam cross-section-wise into multiple segments and then overlap these segments of different intensities into a recombined beam of improved uniformity. A variety of optical homogenization devices have been developed, including fly's-eye lens arrays, hollow and solid light tunnels, beam-folding wedged mirrors and split prisms.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, cell mass {{concentration}} in the slurry had the strongest effect on the total protein release (Fig.  2 a, b) and the ADI release (Fig.  1 a, b) mainly because more of these components were available {{to be released in}} more concentrated slurry of cells. The biomass specific protein release did not increase with increasing concentration of the cells in the slurry; therefore disruption was actually less effective at higher biomass concentrations. In other types of high-pressure <b>homogenizers,</b> the disruption rate of cells has been generally found to be independent of the cell {{concentration in the}} slurry (Singh et al. 2005; Tam et al. 2012; Singh 2013), but the amount of the intracellular material released is obviously dependent on the concentration of the cells in the slurry. In contrast to high-pressure <b>homogenizers,</b> the disruption rate in bead mills is generally observed to increase with increasing concentration of the cells in the slurry being processed (Chisti and Moo-Young 1986; Ricci-Silva et al. 2000; Mei et al. 2005).|$|R
50|$|A <b>homogenizer</b> is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} or industrial equipment used for the homogenization of various types of material, such as tissue, plant, food, soil, and many others. Many different models have been developed using various physical technologies for disruption. The 'mortar and pestle', already used for thousands of years, is a standard tool even in modern laboratories. More modern solutions are based on blender type of instruments (also known in the kitchen), bead mills, ultrasonic treatment (also sonication), rotor-stator mechanical, high pressure, and many other physical forces.Cell fractionation is done by <b>homogenizer</b> to release the organelles from cell. Whereas older technologies just focused on the disruption of the material, newer technologies also address quality or environmental aspects, such as cross-contamination, aerosols, risk of infection, or noise. Homogenization is a very common sample preparation step prior to the analysis of nucleic acids, proteins, cells, metabolism, pathogens, and many other targets.|$|E

Barbell horns are able to amplify ultrasonic amplitudes while retaining large output diameters and radiating areas. It is, therefore, possible to directly reproduce laboratory optimization studies in a commercial production environment by switching from Converging to Barbell horns while maintaining high ultrasonic amplitudes. If correctly scaled up, the processes generate the same reproducible results on the plant floor as they do in the laboratory.|$|R
