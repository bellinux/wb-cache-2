In the interview, [...] Gates provided his perspective on [...] climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: [...] "... there'll be some really bad things that'll <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." [...] Gates also identified innovation as the [...] "real driver of progress" [...] and pronounced that [...] "America's way better today than it's ever been." ...|$|E
500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's going to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> episode {{and you get the}} scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated {{that he would not be}} surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E

[...] The deadlock was broken by what BBC News called [...] "frantic behind-the-scenes negotiations" [...] by Beijing. [...] However, Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso stated that his country {{was not willing to}} return to the six-party talks until North Korea had renounced nuclear weapons.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, {{when asked}} about climate change and {{regulating}} carbon dioxide, he stated: “When you start looking at trying to regulate something like carbon dioxide, which is a natural, biological process, you start running into areas of confusion” and “I think certainly over the millennia, we've seen changes in our climate both ways, and I think throughout the future millennia {{we will continue to}} see climate change that goes both ways. But the issue for this election is not what's going to be <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 200 years, it's going to be what's <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 12 months.” ...|$|R

After Collector's tormented {{assistant}} grabs an Infinity Stone which causes an explosion, Howard is among the creatures in Collector's cages that are set free. Howard is later shown in a post-credits scene having a drink with the Collector and Cosmo the Spacedog in the wrecked archives of the Collector's lair. In August 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn said, [...] "It's possible Howard could reappear as more of a character in the Marvel [...] Universe. But if people think that’s going to lead to a Howard The Duck movie, that’s probably not going to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four years. Who knows after that?" ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the first}} concert, {{the music was}} {{composed}} by César Franck, Pierre de Bréville, Ernest Chausson, Gabriel Fauré and Julien Tiersot.

60|$|But that {{council was}} never to be called, for Andrew Fletcher's {{association}} with the rebellion was drawing rapidly to its close, and there was that to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few hours which should counteract all the encouragement with which the Duke had been fortified that day. Towards evening little Heywood Dare, the Taunton goldsmith, who had landed at Seatown and gone out with {{the news of the}} Duke's arrival, rode into Lyme with forty horse, mounted, himself, upon a beautiful charger which was destined to be the undoing of him.|$|E
60|$|The attack had {{obviously}} been well timed and arranged with the coöperation of revolutionaries in the town, {{but while the}} rebels had gained an entrance, they seemed unable to follow up their success, and it remained {{to be seen if}} they could hold their ground until reënforcements arrived. Finding no opportunity for doing anything useful, Cliffe sat down on the pavement and lighted a cigarette. He did not feel the nervousness he had expected, but he was tired and hungry. It was four o'clock on the previous afternoon when he shared the officers' frugal dinner, and he had eaten nothing since. There was no use in speculating about what was likely to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few hours, but he meant to have a reckoning with Gomez if he came through alive.|$|E
6000|$|The human race, {{to which}} {{so many of my}} readers belong, has been playing at children's games from the beginning, and will {{probably}} do it till the end, which is a nuisance for the few people who grow up. And one of the games to which it is most attached is called [...] "Keep to-morrow dark," [...] and which is also named (by the rustics in Shropshire, I have no doubt) [...] "Cheat the Prophet." [...] The players listen very carefully and respectfully to all that the clever men have to say about what is to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation. The players then wait until all the clever men are dead, and bury them nicely. They then go and do something else. That is all. For a race of simple tastes, however, it is great fun.|$|E

The fight lasted 20 seconds with Woodley walking away victorious. He collected a perfect 7-0 record in amateur bouts with all bouts being finished by a KO or submission.|$|R
60|$|For {{a time he}} {{had less}} trouble than he expected; but the channel turned at its outer end and wind and swell would strike at him at an awkward angle, {{when he took the}} bend. As he entered it, the moon shone out, and he saw the black top of a rock dangerously close to leeward. He waved the lantern, but the lighter, with sea and current on her weather bow, forged almost {{straight}} ahead, and the straining hawser dragged the launch back. Reaching forward, Dick opened the throttle valve to its limit, and then sat grim and still while the throb of the screw shook the trembling hull. Something would <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> half minute unless he could get the lighter round. Glancing back, he saw her low, wet side shine in the moonlight. Two dark figures stood aft by the tiller, and he thought the foam about the rock was only a fathom or two away.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the things}} you young {{people are going to}} see!" [...] Mrs. Thornbury continued. She {{included}} them all in her forecast, she included them all in her maternity, although the party comprised William Pepper and Miss Allan, both of whom might have been supposed to have seen a fair share of the panorama. [...] "When I see how the world has changed in my lifetime," [...] she went on, [...] "I can set no limit to what may <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> fifty years. Ah, no, Mr. Pepper, I don't agree with you in the least," [...] she laughed, interrupting his gloomy remark about things going steadily from bad to worse. [...] "I know I ought to feel that, but I don't, I'm afraid. They're going to be much better people than we were. Surely everything goes to prove that. All round me I see women, young women, women with household cares of every sort, going out and doing things that we should not have thought it possible to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My man," [...] said Theriere, {{once the}} two were behind the closed door of the officer's cabin, [...] "I needn't ask how much you overheard of the {{conversation}} in the captain's cabin.

Keep a close tongue in your head and stick by me in what's going to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few days. This bunch," [...] he jerked his thumb {{in the direction of the}} captain's cabin, [...] "are fixing their necks for halters, an' I for one don't intend to poke my head through any noose of another man's making. There's more in this thing if it's handled right, and handled without too many men in on the whack-up than we can get out of it if that man Divine has to be counted in.

6000|$|What <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> moment no {{one could}} quite tell; but as the door was torn open there was a mingled cry of [...] "Angel!" [...] and of [...] "Lance!"

60|$|What <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{few minutes}} <b>the</b> Rover boys could {{scarcely}} tell, afterward. An {{effort was made}} to get out a life-boat, and it disappeared almost as soon as it left the side, carrying some sailors with it. Then some red-fire blazed up, lighting up the tragic scene, and revealing a schooner standing close by the steamer. The sailing vessel had her bowsprit broken and part of her forward rail torn away.|$|R
60|$|But in the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the game of Cheat the Prophet was made far more difficult than it had ever been before. The reason was, that there were so many prophets and so many prophecies, that it was difficult to elude all their ingenuities. When a man did something free and frantic and entirely his own, a horrible thought struck him afterwards; it might have been predicted. Whenever a duke climbed a lamp-post, when a dean got drunk, he could not be really happy, he could not be certain that he was not fulfilling some prophecy. In {{the beginning}} of the twentieth century you could not see the ground for clever men. They were so common that a stupid man was quite exceptional, and when they found him, they followed him in crowds down the street and treasured him up and gave him some high post in the State. And all these clever men were at work giving accounts of what would <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> age, all quite clear, all quite keen-sighted and ruthless, and all quite different. And it seemed that the good old game of hoodwinking your ancestors could not really be managed this time, because the ancestors neglected meat and sleep and practical politics, so that they might meditate day and night on what their descendants would be likely to do.|$|E
