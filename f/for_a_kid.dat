500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E

Speaking of the character, co-director Don Hall said [...] "Hiro is transitioning from boy to man, it's a {{tough time}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude. Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid. So {{no matter what he}} did, he was able to take the edge off the character {{in a way that made}} him authentic, but appealing".|$|E

I often wonder why I never came out of there a criminal. With all the characters and perverts I met, it certainly would have been the easy way to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> to grow up in. I got used to dealing with groups of boys and getting on with life in unpleasant circumstances and being smart and funny and subversive at the expense of authority. Perfect training for Python." ...|$|E

Thinking that it might be in the valley, I peered up it. As I was looking, from round a great rock glided a ghost. She stood still, with the {{moonlight}} shining on her, and gazed towards the Nile.

6000|$|We set out {{at seven}} a.m. {{on the next}} day, when an Azyab or south-easterly wind was promised by the damp air, the slaty sea, and the gloomy nimbi on the hill-tops. A small party landed after two hours' steaming, in search of quartz, which proved to be chloritic {{sandstones}} and limestones. In the broad valley they found a few Muzayni families, with their camels, sheep, and goats. These unfortunates had no tents, sleeping under the trees; they were desperate beggars, and, although half-starved, they asked a napoleon <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> declaring that such was its price at the quarantine station of Tor. Here the errors of the Hydrographic Chart, which have been copied literally by the latest and best popular books such as Professor Palmer's [...] "Desert of the Exodus," [...] began to excite our astonishment. For instance, Ras Kusayr ("the Short One") becomes Ras Arser--what a name for a headland! A good survey will presently become a sine quâ non. Unfortunately Ahmed Kaptán was suffering so much that I could not ask him to make solar observations; {{while the rest of}} us had other matters in hand. It was a great disappointment, where so much useful work remains to be done.|$|E
60|$|But see! Roger Conant {{has other}} neighbors within view. Peter Palfrey {{likewise}} has built himself a house, {{and so has}} Balch, and Norman, and Woodbury. Their dwellings, indeed,--such is the ingenious contrivance of this piece of pictorial mechanism,--seem to have arisen, at various points of the scene, even while we {{have been looking at}} it. The forest-track, trodden more and more by the hobnailed shoes of these sturdy and ponderous Englishmen, has now a distinctness which it never could have acquired from the light tread of a hundred times as many Indian moccasins. It will be a street, anon! As we observe it now, it goes onward from one clearing to another, here plunging into a shadowy strip of woods, there open to the sunshine, but everywhere showing a decided line, along which human interests have begun to hold their career. Over yonder swampy spot, two trees have been felled, and laid side by side to make a causeway. In another place, the axe has cleared away a confused intricacy of fallen trees and clustered boughs, which had been tossed together by a hurricane. So now the little children, just beginning to run alone, may trip along the path, and not often stumble over an impediment, unless they stray from it to gather wood-berries beneath the trees. And, besides the feet of grown people and children, there are the cloven hoofs of a small herd of cows, who seek their subsistence from the native grasses, and help to deepen the track of the future thoroughfare. Goats also browse along it, and nibble at the twigs that thrust themselves across the way. Not seldom, in its more secluded portions, where the black shadow of the forest strives to hide the trace of human-footsteps, stalks a gaunt wolf, on the watch <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> or a young calf; or fixes his hungry gaze on the group of children gathering berries, and can hardly forbear to rush upon them. And the Indians, coming from their distant wigwams to view the white man's settlement, marvel at the deep track which he makes, and perhaps are saddened by a flitting presentiment that this heavy tread will find its way over all the land; and that the wild-woods, the wild wolf, and the wild Indian will alike be trampled beneath it. Even so shall it be. The pavements of the Main Street must be laid over the red man's grave.|$|E
