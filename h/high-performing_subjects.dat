40|$|Thirty pilots flew three {{simulated}} landing approaches {{under conditions}} of low, medium, and high workload. Workload conditions were created by varying time pressure and external communications requirements. Our interest was in how the pilots strategically managed or adapted to the increasing workload. We independently assessed the pilot's ranking of the priority of different discrete tasks during the approach and landing. Pilots were found to sacrifice some aspects of primary flight control as workload increased. For discrete tasks, increasing workload increased {{the amount of time}} in performing the high priority tasks, decreased the time in performing those of lowest priority, and did not affect duration of performance episodes or optimality of scheduling of tasks of any priority level. Individual differences analysis revealed that <b>high-performing</b> <b>subjects</b> scheduled discrete tasks earlier in the flight and shifted more often between different activities...|$|E

This disturbance is even more severe when the surrounding conversations are intelligible. For this reason the disruptive power of such babble-like noises can be quantified by measuring speech intelligibility. As such, the Speech Transmission Index is usually {{used to assess the}} quality of open-plan offices. In this article, the STI is used to evaluate the nuisance potential of sound environments in an open-plan office. 57 subjects were confronted with a serial memory task in four STI conditions (from 0. 25 to 0. 65). Noise annoyance was assessed objectively by measuring performance, and subjectively using the NASA-TLX questionnaire for measuring cognitive load. A very strong inter-individual variability appeared in performance measurements. Approximately half of the panel was made of high performing subjects, who proved to be insensitive to speech intelligibility. For the other half, performance was reduced when STI increased, as shown in previous studies, with a plateau for STI greater than 0. 45. This strong inter-individual variability can explain the discrepancy between results observed in previously published studies. The NASA-TLX questionnaire proved to give useful complementary results. For example, <b>high-performing</b> <b>subjects</b> related a higher workload in the condition of maximum speech intelligibility...|$|E

Trained analysts can manipulate algorithmically processed data to find conclusions for further investigation, and visualization of this data can enable analysts to draw conclusions more quickly and accurately than from text alone. To examine various methods for manipulating visualized, networked data an experiment was conducted in which participants used an interactive program to determine if hierarchical sub-graph hypotheses conformed to network data. To determine what types of training best prepare analysts to interact with such networked data sets, participants were divided into four groups, each completing one of four training exercises prior to the interactive visualization portion of the experiment. Training sessions required participants to examine or actively create visual, verbal, or visual and verbal hierarchical structures. Groups that were trained with multiple representations of hierarchical structures correctly completed more hypothesis testing tasks and were able to do so more quickly. All groups showed an overall reduction in time needed to correctly complete the hypothesis testing tasks as they proceeded through trials, resulting in learning curves for each group. Various solution methods were identified that were used by <b>high-performing</b> <b>subjects,</b> but differences in method suggest that analysts create individualized mental-models, and there may be no single “best” solution method...|$|E
40|$|Despite the use by {{instructors}} of particulate {{nature of}} matter (PNOM) diagrams {{in the general}} chemistry classroom, misconceptions on stoichiometry continue to prevail among students tasked with conceptual problems on concepts of limiting and excess reagents, and reaction yields. This dissertation set out to explore students’ understanding of stoichiometry at the microscopic level as they solved problems that using PNOM diagrams. In particular, the study investigated how students coordinated symbolic and microscopic representations to demonstrate their knowledge of stoichiometric concepts, quantified the prevalence and explained the nature of stoichiometric misconceptions in terms of dual processing and dual coding theories, and used eye tracking to identify visual behaviors that accompanied cognitive processes students used to solve conceptual stoichiometry problems with PNOM diagrams. Interviews with students asked to draw diagrams for specific stoichiometric situations showed dual processing systems were in play. Many students {{were found to have}} used these processing systems in a heuristic-analytic sequence. Heuristics, such as the factor-label method and the least amount misconception, were often used by students to select information for further processing in an attempt to reduce the cognitive load of the subsequent analytic stage of the solution process. Diagrams drawn by students were used then to develop an instrument administered over a much larger sample of the general chemistry student population. The robustness of the dual processing theory was manifested by response patterns observed with large proportions of the student samples. These response patterns suggest that many students seemed to rely on heuristics to respond to a specific item for one of two diagrams given for the same chemical context, and then used a more analytic approach in dealing with the same item for the other diagram. It was also found that many students incorrectly treated items dealing with the same chemical context independently of each other instead of using a more integrative approach. A comparison of the visual behaviors of <b>high-performing</b> <b>subjects</b> with those of low-performers revealed that high performers relied heavily on the given diagrams to obtain information. They were found to have spent more time fixating on diagrams, looked between the chemical equation and the diagram for each problem more often, and used their episodic memory more heavily to collect information early on than low performers did. Retrospective think-alouds used with eye tracking also revealed specific strategies, such as counting and balancing of atoms and molecules across both sides of a diagram, as well as comparing ratios between atoms and molecules in a diagram with those given in a balanced equation, used by students to analyze PNOM diagrams...|$|E
