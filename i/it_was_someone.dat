5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> else.|$|E
25|$|When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja {{also tells}} Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> else, and goes {{with her to}} see what she discovered. It is {{revealed}} that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, under the command of Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th-century {{historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events {{before and during}} the Three Kingdoms period, the writer Luo Guanzhong depicts the ill-fated defence of Chengdu in a dramatic fashion. When the Shu emperor Liu Shan sought Zhuge Zhan's opinion on how to drive the Wei invaders, Zhuge Zhan thought of dressing up as his deceased father to scare away the enemy. His ruse worked initially as the Wei soldiers panicked and scattered upon thinking that Zhuge Liang had returned from the dead. However, Deng Ai quickly pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> pretending to be Zhuge Liang and ordered his troops to regroup and attack. Zhuge Zhan died at the Battle of Mianzhu Pass along with his eldest son Zhuge Shang, Huang Chong and others while helplessly outnumbered by Deng Ai's forces.|$|E

[...] Later, during another Stern appearance, when asked further about the incident, Hank said that the abuse was in the form of rape.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} attempt on Paul's life, Scott McGregor was {{introduced}} to the cast as Detective Brennan, who was placed in charge of the investigation. Brennan wasted no time in questioning the Ramsay Street residents, but he received conflicting information. Jackie Brygel from TV Week reported that Mark would have his work cut out for him as everyone was seemingly intent on pointing the finger at someone else. Everyone began jumping to conclusions as they had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor explained that Kate Ramsay would give Rebecca a false alibi, while Lyn would get Diana into [...] "strife" [...] and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) lands Andrew in trouble, but he would not help himself either. Channel 5 ran a poll on their website asking viewers to predict who pushed Paul and over 10,000 votes were cast. The majority of the voters thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> other than the six suspects. 20% thought Diana had pushed Paul, followed by 19% who correctly guessed it was Rebecca. Declan pulled in 16% of the vote, Andrew had 14%, while Lyn drew 6%, Sonya 5% and Toadie had 1%.|$|E

2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald Rumsfeld said “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would eat you last. ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- has made clear its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow and so many other places. But some seem not to have learned history's lessons. ...With the growing lethality and the increasing availability of weapons, can we truly afford to believe that somehow, some way, vicious extremists can be appeased? Can folks really continue to think that free countries can negotiate a separate peace with terrorists?" ...|$|E
