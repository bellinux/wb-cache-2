5|$|This ending was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative ending was the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative ending would have been broadcast if a third series was being made, as that ending was much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E
25|$|When Joplin and her back-up band {{performed}} at Vets Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday night, May 11, 1969, Columbus Dispatch reviewer John Huddy wrote: Frequently suggestive {{with a series}} of limited but obvious moves, Miss Joplin wears hip-hugging silk bellbottoms and alternates between a wail and a teeth-rattling scream. Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling coarsely at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked into the lobby and watched customers arrive. She was not recognized.|$|E

How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." ...|$|R

500|$|Kavner has {{frequently}} appeared in Woody Allen films, having roles in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Radio Days (1987), New York Stories (1989), Alice (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), the television movie Don't Drink the Water (1994) and Deconstructing Harry (1997). Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When {{she does a}} scene, you listen to her and look at her, and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny." [...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don't even have to read it." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure he <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{was one of}} {{the opening}} acts on Britney Spears' June 16 – August 13 Femme Fatale Tour. She and Kesha {{appeared}} on the remix of Spears' [...] "Till the World Ends", which peaked at number-three on the Billboard Hot 100. On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a [...] "nip slip" [...] during a live performance on Good Morning America. Minaj was criticized for wearing the low-cut shirt during her performance which led to the brief exposure of her breast on a live telecast. ABC apologized for incident. Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt. The incident soaked protest from the Parents Television Council. President of the PTC president Tim Winter stated, [...] "the Parents Television Council <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about Nicki Minaj's wardrobe malfunction this morning. For the umpteenth time in recent memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for children and families." [...] Winter called out Good Morning America for not using the five-second delay to prevent the broadcast of the exposure. Minaj has been invited to perform at fashion events; Donatella Versace invited her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H, and she performed [...] "Super Bass" [...] at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.|$|E

500|$|Peter Timmis of Cross Rhythms gave Move nine stars {{out of ten}} squares, commenting that [...] " [...] If {{you like}} your rock soulful and gospel-tinged then 'Move' is an album you'll want to check out". Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com said that [...] "As always, Third Day plays to its strength... to craft accessible, {{interesting}} country rock. When it clicks, the result is arm-hair-raising good. Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and they say it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with {{numerous}} directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. India Hill of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "When Beyoncé does something, you listen. Not just because her lyrics are infectious and her beats are always catchy, but because if she <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> you know it’s going to be important." [...] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian commented [...] "It is not an {{exaggeration to say that}} there is no other living musical artist who could ignite such a broad and unavoidable conversation just by releasing a new album – even a visual one, and it’s her second visual album – or who could turn an hour-long, visually narrative film for that album into a Saturday night watch-with-your-friends event on subscription cable channel." [...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms… I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love". In 2017, she released the controversial music video for [...] "Formation", which includes representations of racial injustice against African Americans in the United States during the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E
2500|$|Emin {{was invited}} to Madonna's country estate Ashcombe and has been {{described}} by the singer, [...] "Tracey is intelligent and wounded and not afraid to expose herself," [...] she says. [...] "She is provocative but she <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I can relate to that." [...] David Bowie, a childhood inspiration of Emin's, also became friends with the artist. Bowie has described Emin as [...] "William Blake as a woman, written by Mike Leigh".|$|E

2500|$|The composers of {{the first}} half of the 19th century were acutely aware of the {{conversational}} paradigm established by Haydn and Mozart. Schumann wrote that in a true quartet [...] "everyone <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say...</b> a conversation, often truly beautiful, often oddly and turbidly woven, among four people." [...] Their awareness is exemplified by composer and virtuoso violinist Louis Spohr. Spohr divided his 36 string quartets into two types: the quatuor brillant, essentially a violin concerto with string trio accompaniment; and quatuor dialogue, in the conversational tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Similar acclaim {{was given}} to the five date Seaside Tour of coastal resorts in the south of England which Ant {{undertook}} on 17–22 June 2011. Local Cornish radio station The Source FM cheered 18 June 2011 Falmouth concert on its website: [...] "The audience goes wild. Adam stalks the stage, in control, he already knows he's got us ... he plays songs that a man in his mid fifties shouldn’t really get away with, but he does, with dignity. Here's a man who still <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and manages to say it with 30 year old songs...Someone boos, Adam retaliates and we're with him. There’s nothing to boo here... Did that really just happen? Did Adam Ant really just blow us all away with the best gig of the year so far? I think he did." [...] The Seaside Tour served both as a follow-up to the main UK tour and a warm-up to Ant's appearance at Hard Rock Calling 2011 in Hyde Park on 26 June 2011, third on the bill to Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks before an audience of 45,000. The festival's official website lauded his performance, reporting that [...] "Adam Ant returned to London in tip-top shape this afternoon on the Main Stage in Hyde Park ...he left the stage to rapturous applause and cheers, leaving no question as to who was the real Prince Charming this weekend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing for La Stampa, Mario Gromo {{argued that}} it was a [...] "film of a certain {{importance}} because of its many intelligent moments, its sound portrayal of provincial life, and because it is the second film of a young director who evidently has considerable talent... The Italian film industry now has a new director and one who puts his own personal ideas before any of the customary traditions of the trade. Fellini's is a fresh approach". [...] "It is the atmosphere that counts most in this unusual film," [...] wrote Francesco Càallari of the Gazzetta del Lunedi, [...] "an intensely human and poetical atmosphere altogether estranged from the provincialism of the setting... Fellini <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and he says it with an acute sense of observation... Here is someone apart from the other young directors of post-war Italian cinema. Fellini has a magical touch." [...] First published 31 August 1953 in the Gazzeta del Lunedi (Genoa). After praising Fellini's Venice triumph, Ermanno Contini of Il Secolo XIX outlined the film's weaknesses: [...] "I Vitelloni does not have a particularly solid structure, the story is discontinuous, seeking unity through the complex symbiosis of episodes and details... The narrative, built up around strong emotions and powerful situations, lacks solid organic unity, and at times this undermines the story's creative force, resulting in an imbalance of tone and pace and a certain sense of tedium. But such shortcomings are amply atoned for by the film's sincerity and authenticity." [...] Arturo Lanocita of Corriere della Sera wrote: [...] "I Vitelloni gives a graphic and authentic picture of certain aimless evenings, the streets populated by groups of idle youths... The film is a series of annotations, hints, and allusions without unity... With a touch of irony, Fellini tries to show the contrast between the way his characters see themselves and the way they really are. Despite its weaknesses, the film {{is one of the best}} in recent years." [...] For Giulio Cesare Castello of Cinema VI, the film proved [...] "that Fellini is the Italian film industry's most talented satirist, and an acute observer and psychologist of human behaviour. Like any good moralist, he knows how to give his story a meaning, to provide more than just simple entertainment".|$|E
