5|$|In January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel {{restrictions}} and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission {{to play an}} exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. Bud Selig, the MLB Commissioner, allowed for {{the exploration of the}} series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA. The MLBPA insisted on a second game to be held in the United States. A contingent of United States Representatives, including Ros-Lehtinen, Robert Menendez, <b>Dan</b> <b>Burton,</b> Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and Rick Lazio, lobbied Fehr to try to block the series.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative <b>Dan</b> <b>Burton</b> openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.|$|E

25|$|Burton {{worked as}} a caddy at a local country club {{in order to make}} ends meet, where he learned the golf skills that led to his winning a statewide golf {{championship}} in high school. He graduated from Shortridge High School in 1957, and attended Indiana University (1958–59) and the Cincinnati Bible Seminary (now known as Cincinnati Christian University) (1959–60). He served in the United States Army from 1956 to 1957, before leaving active duty to return to college but remained in the Army Reserves from 1957 to 1962. After school, Burton became a real estate broker and he founded the <b>Dan</b> <b>Burton</b> Insurance Agency in 1968.|$|E
500|$|Kemp {{was partly}} at fault for not {{achieving}} either of his primary goals {{because he did}} not get {{along with the rest of}} the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker, White House Chief of Staff, that Bush's best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention, Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemp's reference to parts of the President's economic policy as [...] "gimmicks" [...] after the 1992 State of the Union Address. Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bush's administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and <b>Dan</b> <b>Burton</b> requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a [...] "domestic policy czar." [...] The letter, highlighting Kemp's [...] "energy, enthusiasm and national clout", insulted Bush. Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the [...] for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands. Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992, and some pundits agreed with him.|$|E

Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; [...] "Cute but psycho. Things even out." [...] According to Hathaway, [...] "She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen. She really likes the dark side, but she's so scared of going too far into it that she's made everything appear very light and happy. But she's living in that place {{out of fear that}} she won't be able to control herself." [...] Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as [...] "a punk-rock vegan pacifist", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of <b>Dan</b> Flavin. <b>Burton</b> said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson.|$|R

Meanwhile, Dr. <b>Dan</b> Halpern (LeVar <b>Burton),</b> another of the refugees, is studying parts culled from the bodies of the zombies, but he is unable to make much headway because he only has access to 'dead' zombies. His research is further hindered when Caspian (Danny Trejo) and other refugees burn the zombie corpses being stored on the island.|$|R
