40|$|Streptococcus mutans {{has been}} {{identified}} as the primary etiological agent of human dental caries. Since its identification, there has been research focused on the development of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> to prevent this disease. Preliminary research has been conducted to test both active and passive vaccines for Streptococcus mutans in animals and humans. Although <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> for dental caries caused by Streptococcus mutans would most likely be administered to children, no testing of any type of dental caries vaccines has been conducted on children as of yet. The public health imperative for the development of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> is great. Not only will <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> reduce the various consequences, but it would also improve quality of life for many individuals. Among the many possible vaccine antigen candidates, researchers have also been focusing on protein antigens, GTFs, and Gbps as possible candidates for <b>a</b> <b>vaccine.</b> There are also many routes of administration under research, with topical, oral, and intranasal showing a lot of promise. This review will provide an overview on the current state of research, present key factors influencing prevalence of caries, and summarize and discuss the results of animal and human studies on caries vaccines against Streptococcus mutans. The progress and obstacles facing the development of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> to fight dental caries will also be discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{test the}} {{feasibility}} of a clinical trial comparing the effects of transverse friction massage (TFM) and a home exercise programme (<b>HEP)</b> and <b>a</b> <b>HEP</b> alone {{in the treatment of}} plantar fasciitis. Design Prospective, non-blinded, different subject design experimental pilot study. Setting Physiotherapy clinic within a community health centre clinic. Participants Twenty-four participants (14 females) aged 43 – 77 years (X = 58), with plantar fasciitis of greater than 4 weeks duration. Interventions Six treatment sessions of TFM in the first 4 weeks for the experimental group together with <b>a</b> <b>HEP</b> for 6 weeks. The control group was given <b>a</b> <b>HEP</b> only for 6 weeks. Main outcome measures Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAPS) and a Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) measured on assessment and every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. Results Subjects demonstrated a reduction in both outcome measures for pain {{at the end of the}} 6 -week treatment (P < 0. 05), but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The outcome measures were found to be suitable for subjects with plantar fasciitis and the methodology appropriate for the research design chosen. Conclusion This study has demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} a clinical trial for the treatment of plantar fasciitis with TFM and <b>a</b> <b>HEP.</b> <b>A</b> retrospective power calculation suggests that recruitment of more than 274 patients would be required to achieve an 80...|$|R
40|$|Since {{licensure}} in 1995 of <b>a</b> hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine,</b> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics {{have been}} implementing an incremental hepatitis A immunization strategy for children. In 1996, {{children living in}} populations with {{the highest rates of}} disease were targeted for immunization, and in 1999 the program was expanded to immunization of children 2 years and older living in states and counties with rates of hepatitis A that historically have been higher than the national average. The 1999 program has been successful; the current rate of hepatitis A is the lowest ever reported in the United States. Regional, ethnic, and racial differences in the incidence of hepatitis A have been eliminated. The incidence of hepatitis A in adults in immunizing states has decreased significantly, suggesting a strong herd-immunity effect associated with immunization. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration changed the youngest approved age of administration of hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> from 24 to 12 months of age, which facilitated incorporation of the vaccine into the recommended childhood immunization schedule. As {{the next step in the}} implementation of the incremental vaccine immunization strategy, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends routine administration of a Food and Drug Administration 9 ̆ 6 licensed hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> to all children 12 to 23 months of age in all states according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 9 ̆ 6 approved immunization schedule. Available data suggest that hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> can be coadministered with other childhood vaccines without decreasing immunogenicity. Hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccines</b> have proven to be extremely safe. In prelicensure clinical trials of both Havrix (GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) and Vaqta (Merck & Co Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ), adverse events were uncommon and mild when they occurred, with resolution typically in less than 1 day. Hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> is contraindicated in people with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> or to <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> component. Because the hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> is <b>an</b> inactivated product, no special precautions are needed for administration to people who are immunocompromised. No data exist about administration of the hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> to pregnant women, but because it is not <b>a</b> live <b>vaccine,</b> the risk to mother and fetus should be extremely low to nonexistent...|$|R
