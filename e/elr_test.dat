40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and discuss the power of the exact {{likelihood}} ratio homogeneity testing procedure of the number of components k in the exponential mixture. First we present the likelihood ratio <b>test</b> for homogeneity (<b>ELR),</b> the likelihood ratio test for homogeneity against two-component exponential mixture (ELR 2), and finally the likelihood ratio test for homogeneity against three-component exponential mixture (ELR 3). Comparative power study of mentioned homogeneity tests against three-component subpopulation alternative is provided. Therein we concentrate on various setups of the scales and weights, which allow us to make conclusions for generic settings. The natural property is observed, namely increase of the power of exact likelihood ratio ELR, ELR 2 and <b>ELR</b> 3 <b>tests</b> with scale parameters considered in the alternative. We can state that the differences in power of ELR, ELR 2 and <b>ELR</b> 3 <b>tests</b> are small – therefore using of the computationally simpler <b>ELR</b> 2 <b>test</b> is recommended for broad usage rather than computationally more expensive <b>ELR</b> 3 <b>test</b> in the cases when unobserved heterogeneity is modelled. Anyhow caution should be taken before automatic usage of ELR 3 in more informative settings, since the application of automatic methods hoping that the data will enforce its true structure is deceptive. Application of obtained results in reliability, finance or social sciences is straightforward...|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} likelihood (EL) {{technique is}} a powerful nonparametric method with wide theoretical and practical applications. In this article, we use the EL methodology {{in order to develop}} simple and efficient goodness-of-fit tests for normality based on the dependence between moments that characterizes normal distributions. The new empirical likelihood ratio (<b>ELR)</b> <b>tests</b> are exact and are shown to be very powerful decision rules based on small to moderate sample sizes. Asymptotic results related to the Type I error rates of the proposed tests are presented. We present a broad Monte Carlo comparison between different tests for normality, confirming the preference of the proposed method from a power perspective. A real data example is provided...|$|R

The GNP optimality {{focuses on the}} large deviation errors of tests, i. e., the convergence rates of the type I and II error probabilities under fixed alternatives. We derive (i) the GNP optimality of the empirical likelihood criterion (ELC) test against all alternatives, and (ii) a necessary and a sufficient condition for the GNP optimality of the empirical likelihood ratio (<b>ELR)</b> <b>test</b> against each alternative...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss {{homogeneity}} testing of the exponential distribution. We introduce the exact likelihood ratio test of homogeneity in the subpopulation model, ELR, and the exact likelihood ratio test of homogeneity against the two-components subpopulation alternative, ELR 2. The <b>ELR</b> <b>test</b> is asymptotically optimal in the Bahadur sense when the alternative consists of sampling from a fixed number of components. Thus in some setups the ELR is superior to frequently used tests for exponential homogeneity which are based on the EM algorithm. We demonstrate this fact by both theoretical comparisons and simulations...|$|E

Through the analysis of test data, the conclusions are as follows: the trapping performance of 25 PPI foamed ceramics is obviously better than the trapping performance of 10 PPI foamed ceramics; the trapping performance of foamed ceramics will be continually improved {{with the increase of}} the thickness; the increase of the space of the foamed ceramics is conducive to improve the efficiency of soot trapping.

40|$|Verification of {{regression}} models is primarily based on analysis of error terms and constitutes {{one of the}} most important steps in applied regression analysis. In cross-sectional models, the error terms are typically heteroskedastic, while in time series regressions the errors are often affected by serial correlation. Consequently, in this paper, we focus on Monte Carlo simulations applied to explore the power of several tests of homogeneity and tests for presence of autocorrelation. In the past decades, the computational power has increased significantly to allow the benefit of simulation from exact distributions, which are not defined explicitly. We will discuss 1) testing of homogeneity for a given number of components in the exponential mixture approximated by subpopulations and 2) simulation of power in several commonly used tests of autocorrelation. For the first case, we consider exact likelihood ratio <b>test</b> (<b>ELR)</b> and exact likelihood ratio test against the alternative with two-component subpopulation (ELR 2). In the second case, we consider the Durbin-Watson, Durbin h, Breusch-Godfrey, Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests of 1 st order serial correlation and the runs test of randomness in two different types of linear {{regression models}}...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{likelihood}} and the bootstrap play influential {{roles in}} contemporary statistics. This thesis studies two distinct statistical inference problems, {{referred to as}} Part I and Part II, related to the empirical likelihood and bootstrap, respectively. Part I of this thesis concerns making statistical inferences on multiple groups of samples that contain excess zero observations. A unique feature of the target populations is that the distribution of each group {{is characterized by a}} non-standard mixture of a singular distribution at zero and a skewed nonnegative component. In Part I of this thesis, we propose modelling the nonnegative components using a semiparametric, multiple-sample, density ratio model (DRM). Under this semiparametric setup, we can efficiently utilize information from the combined samples even with unspecified underlying distributions. We first study the question of testing homogeneity of multiple nonnegative distributions when there is an excess of zeros in the data, under the proposed semiparametric setup. We develop a new empirical likelihood ratio (<b>ELR)</b> <b>test</b> for homogeneity and show that this ELR has a χ^ 2 -type limiting distribution under the homogeneous null hypothesis. A nonparametric bootstrap procedure is proposed to calibrate the finite-sample distribution of the ELR. The consistency of this bootstrap procedure is established under both the null and alternative hypotheses. Simulation studies show that the bootstrap <b>ELR</b> <b>test</b> has an accurate nominal type I error, is robust to changes of underlying distributions, is competitive to, and sometimes more powerful than, several popular one- and two-part tests. A real data example is used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed test. We next investigate the problem of comparing the means of multiple nonnegative distributions, with excess zero observations, under the proposed semiparametric setup. We develop a unified inference framework based on our new ELR statistic, and show that this ELR has a χ^ 2 -type limiting distribution under a general null hypothesis. This allows us to construct a new test for mean equality. Simulation results show favourable performance of the proposed <b>ELR</b> <b>test</b> compared with other existing tests for mean equality, especially when the correctly specified basis function in the DRM is the logarithm function. A real data set is analyzed to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. In Part II of this thesis, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of, the commonly used, bootstrap percentile confidence intervals when the parameters are subject to inequality constraints. We concentrate on the important one- and two-sample problems with data generated from distributions in the natural exponential family. Our attention is focused on quantifying asymptotic coverage probabilities of the percentile confidence intervals based on bootstrapping maximum likelihood estimators. We propose a novel local framework to study the subtle asymptotic behaviour of bootstrap percentile confidence intervals when the true parameter values are close to the boundary. Under this framework, we discover that when the true parameter is on, or close to, the restriction boundary, the local asymptotic coverage probabilities can always exceed the nominal level in the one-sample case; however, they can be, surprisingly, both under and over the nominal level in the two-sample case. The results provide theoretical justification and guidance on applying the bootstrap percentile method to constrained inference problems. The two individual parts of this thesis are connected by being referred to as constrained statistical inference. Specifically, in Part I, the semiparametric density ratio model uses an exponential tilting constraint, which is a type of equality constraint, on the parameter space. In Part II, we deal with inequality constraints, such as a boundary or ordering constraints, on the parameter space. For both parts, an important regularity condition in traditional likelihood inference, that parameters should be interior points of the parameter space, is violated. Therefore, the respective inference procedures involve non-standard asymptotics that create new technical challenges...|$|E
