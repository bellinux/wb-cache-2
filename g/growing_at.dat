5|$|Capable of <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) {{remotely}} operated vehicle, KAIKO, collected sediment core from the Challenger Deep. 432 living specimens of soft-walled foraminifera {{were identified in}} the sediment samples. Foraminifera are single-celled protists that construct shells. There are an estimated 4,000 species of living foraminifera. Out of the 432 organisms collected, {{the overwhelming majority of}} the sample consisted of simple, soft-shelled foraminifera, with others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera Leptohalysis and Reophax. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled allogromids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. Small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> the time of its death.|$|E

5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E
5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) {{structures}} called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> their tips. Each tip contains {{a set of}} aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the adult}} Guianan cock-of-the-rock {{consists}} mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous. Up to 65 species of fruit {{have been reported in}} their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit. In the British Guiana, Thomas E. Gilliard found papayas <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> the base of a huge rock. On top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing {{in that part of the}} forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting.|$|E
5|$|The global {{population}} was reduced {{by more than}} 99% during the 20th century.

5|$|The various {{planets are}} thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the {{disc-shaped}} cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> the rate of centimetres per year {{over the course of the}} next few million years.|$|E
5|$|Until the post-World War II {{population}} {{boom of the}} 1950s, Marysville's population never {{rose above}} 2,000 residents, who were all located within the original city limits. The city began annexing surrounding areas in the 1950s, anticipating suburban development that would replace existing farmland and forest lands. From 1950 to 1980, the city doubled in population, growing to over 5,000 residents, with an additional 15,000 residents in surrounding areas. Marysville's population grew five-fold between 1980 and 2000, increasing to 25,000 through natural growth and annexation of developed areas. From 2000 to 2010, the city's population increased to over 60,000 after the annexation of the urban growth area and continued development, making Marysville the second-largest city in Snohomish County behind Everett. In 2015, Marysville was the fastest-growing city in Washington, <b>growing</b> <b>at</b> a rate of 2.5 percent to an estimated population of 66,773. , Marysville is the 17th largest city in Washington.|$|E

Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E
