500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gives George Park, Fred O'Dwyer, and Milton Greene a tour around the backstage area of TGS. Fred tells Kenneth that he resembles a man he served with in the service, which Kenneth says [...] "Well, obviously that's a coincidence. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> in Normandy?". Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served. Jack shows up where Kenneth and the three men are, and tells Kenneth {{that he would like to}} talk to Milton, prompting Kenneth to tell Jack [...] "As head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request." [...] Jack and Milton are then seen at Jack's office.|$|E
500|$|Jyoti Singh {{was born}} and raised in Delhi while her parents were from a small village in the Ballia {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh. Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{also made}} the cover of Rolling Stone for a record-setting sixth time. Mad Love entered the Billboard Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the number 3 position. The project {{continued}} her streak of Top 10 hits with [...] "How Do I Make You?", originally recorded by Billy Thermal, and [...] "Hurt So Bad", originally a Top 10 hit for Little Anthony & the Imperials. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to Pat Benatar's Crimes of Passion album). Benatar praised Ronstadt by stating, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} good female singers around. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> the best? Ronstadt is still alive!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Most {{certainly}} I say so, your honour. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I?</b> It <b>was</b> {{entrusted to}} me with the other things by my master. To open {{it would have been}} a breach of trust." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "For twenty years!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Oh, Jack, {{you must}} be wrong; for <b>how</b> <b>could</b> that <b>be?</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only {{eighteen}} when all this happened. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> my real father have been twenty years away from me, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only eighteen, and I remember him so perfectly?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Erin Gruwell is {{the woman}} who began the Freedom Writers and {{compiled}} her students’ stories into The Freedom Writers Diary. She started teaching {{in the fall of}} 1994 at Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, California. In interviews, she has said that she thinks she is the one who changed the most. “Everything <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told not to do, I did. They told me not to smile. I smiled. They told me never to show emotion. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not <b>be</b> a person, though? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not <b>be</b> compassionate and give a student a hug when they <b>were</b> hurting? <b>I</b> changed the most. I became the student.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Tell me no more,' {{said the}} child quickly. 'Tell me no more. I feel, I know it. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> unmindful of it, when I thought of you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fay, {{think how}} hard and {{dangerous}} the trip's been! I've been worried--and sick with dread--with--Oh, you can't imagine the strain I'm under! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> my old self?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is one of}} the {{properties}} of that force which thou callest fire," [...] she answered sweetly, [...] "to make what has been exposed to it, if for a little while only, as light as thistle-down. Else, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I,</b> who <b>am</b> so frail, have borne yonder block of gold?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man who {{has once}} <b>been</b> refused! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>be</b> foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a {{weakness}} as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{would have}} told him all my mother's letter, {{but he would not}} hear it then. He spoke so tenderly and wisely to me, and he put so plainly before me all I had myself imperfectly thought and hoped in my better state of mind, that, {{penetrated}} as <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> with fervent gratitude towards him through so many years, I believed I had never loved him so dearly, never thanked him in my heart so fully, as I did that night. And when he had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door, and when at last I lay down to sleep, my thought <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>be</b> busy enough, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>be</b> good enough, how in my little way <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever hope to be forgetful enough of myself, devoted enough to him, and useful enough to others, to show him how I blessed and honoured him.|$|R

6000|$|Brooke laughed softly. [...] "I {{scarcely}} think I {{could afford}} to resent a kindness, however it was offered; {{but there is a}} point you don't quite seem to have grasped. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> certain you had remembered me?" ...|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTUS [amazed and indignant]. I lose my post! What are you dreaming about, madam? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} <b>be</b> spared?

6000|$|... "I'd like to fight," [...] I said. [...] "But {{a common}} soldier it's no honour {{to have to}} be told to fight and to be looked down upon while you do it, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> an officer?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{why did you}} {{not tell}} me your object before?" [...] As not a little relieved. [...] "Poor souls--Indians, too--those cruelly-used Indians. Here, here; <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> hesitate. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so sorry it is no more." ...|$|R

6000|$|My man was sallow of face, grizzled, unshaven, muddy on {{elbows and}} back; where the seams of his serge coat yawned {{you could see}} his white nakedness. The vestiges of a paper collar encircled his neck. He looked at us with a grave, swaying surprise. [...] "Where do you come from?" [...] he asked. My heart sank. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> stupid enough to waste energy and time for this? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if {{she should}} marry him, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> sure that--afterwards--you would {{care so much about}} the {{question}} which has all our thoughts, hers and mine?" [...] This inquiry evolved itself from Olive's rapid meditation; but even to herself it seemed a little rough.|$|E
6000|$|About his eternal {{destination}} {{there could}} be no question. The known facts precluded the least ray of hope. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> happy in heaven, supposing I eventually did succeed in slipping in, knowing that he, the lovable old scamp, was burning for ever in hell? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurray!" [...] cried Tommy, [...] "they {{recognize}} me now! Don't be angry, Grizel," [...] he begged her.

6000|$|He let poor Tink {{out of the}} drawer, and {{she flew}} about the nursery {{screaming}} with fury. 'You shouldn't say such things,' Peter retorted. 'Of course I'm very sorry, but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> know you <b>were</b> in the drawer?' ...|$|R
