30|$|When the “life cycle” of {{a product}} comes to its <b>end,</b> <b>waste</b> {{management}} is responsible for proper handling, recycling of valuables in the waste, and disposal of hazardous compounds in the product. Very often, a separation of valuable and hazardous compounds in those products is not possible. Substances banned for further use will {{show up in the}} waste chain even if the products are out of the market since a long time. The time tables for phasing out these substances are often very different depending on national legislation. Moreover, people in industrialized countries, especially skilled workers, are more aware of harmful substances in products as people in developing countries. Globalization of trade without harmonizing the rules for the use of hazardous substances may therefore end up with serious contamination of secondary raw materials by hazardous substances which have not been properly separated in the waste chain.|$|E

40|$|This review aims to {{integrate}} {{the present state of}} knowledge on lactate metabolism in human and mammalian physiology as far as it could be subject to nutritional interventions. An integrated view on the nutritional, metabolic and physiological aspects of lactic acid and lactates might open a perspective for innovative nutritional applications of lactates in health and wellness. Lactic acid was classically considered to be a dead <b>end</b> <b>waste</b> product of anaerobic glycolysis during severe exercise. Mammals, however, do not excrete lactate indicating that lactate cannot be considered as a dead metabolic end product. Despite a rapid and massive production of lactate, lactate is finally oxidized to the normal metabolic end products CO 2 and H 2 O. Besides direct metabolic effects, nutritional applications of lactic acid and lactates are also considered in relation to dietary mineral supply. To the background that lactic acid is in fact a semi manufactured metabolic product, various nutritional applications are proposed in relation to metabolic training of athletes, modulation of metabolic rate, appetite control and excretion of faecal fat for weight management, lowering the glycemic index of bread and improved mineral supplementation in nutritional formulas for infants and people using proton inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|This {{hypothesis}} driven research {{investigated the}} removal of Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn from synthetic metal solutions and real Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) from Wheal Jane mine in West Cornwall UK, employing waste gas sludge (BOS sludge) which is an <b>end</b> <b>waste</b> reside generated from steel production. Batch experiments showed the efficiency and adsorption rates increased with reduction in BOS sludge particle size, lower in initial metal concentration, increase in BOS sludge dosage, an increase in initial pH and increase in agitation speed. Fitting of the Langmuir isotherm model to experimental data gave a good fit with correlation coefficients R^ 2 ≥ 0. 99 and the selectivity series of BOS sludge was: Cu^ 2 ^+>Fe^ 3 ^+>Zn^ 2 ^+>Mn^ 2 ^+. For single and multiadsorbate systems, a Pseudo second order model was the most appropriate theory to satisfactorily describe experimental data and the rate limiting step for this process was chemisorption. Adsorption was spontaneous and high pH promoted adsorption possibly by precipitation and/or ion exchange processes which had taken place between the exchangeable cations present in BOS and solutions. Results from the treatment of real and synthetic AMD solutions revealed that BOS sludge worked well and hence BOS sludge as a novel low cost material {{could be used as}} a sustainable sorbent in AMD treatment technologies. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Hospital is a {{place for}} {{delivering}} health services. Hospitals will produce solid waste due to their health care related daily activities. If not properly handled, the waste will of cause harm to patients, visitors and the environment. Therefore, the importance of healthy environment around the hospital has become a prominent issue to analyze in order to find out problems associated to hospital solid waste management. This research aimed to analyze solid waste management at Roemani Hospital, Semarang. Object of the research is process of integrated solid waste management using data obtained from interview and observation pursuant on the Ministry of Health Decree of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1204 /Menkes/Sk/ 2004. These data were then subject to a descriptive analysis. Results of the study showed that solid waste management had not fulfilled the requirement of the Minister of Health Decree of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1204 /Menkes/Sk/ 2004. In the current solid waste management, phase segregation, collection, and disposal of <b>end</b> <b>waste</b> had not fulfilled the decree’s requirements. Poorly trained personnel and the absence of personal protective equipment, as well as facilities were among the major problems in the management of solid waste. In short, the solid waste management at Roemani Hospital, Semarang did not meet environmental health requirements stipulated within Minister of Health Decree of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1204 /Menkes/Sk/ 2004. To make worse, resources of waste management was inadequate due to lacking of education training and personnel management, which should have been made available, supported by the application of appropriate guidelines and safety standards, provision of equipment and waste treatment facilities are safe for workers and the environment. Evaluation of waste management is a good management for creating the effectiveness and efficiency of solid waste management. Key words : waste disposal, solid waste management, hospital. ...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{management}} {{is a global}} challenge due to high waste generation resulting from high industrialization, urbanization and challenges relating to the efficient implementation of waste management policies acts and standards. Although South Africa has established a number of good waste management policies and related acts and standards, most municipalities still find it challenging to efficiently implement waste management strategies. Ekurhuleni Municipality is facing challenges {{with the implementation of}} effective waste management strategies and compliance to the National Environmental Management Waste Act (2008), (NEMWA) (Act No 59 of 2008). An evaluation of the gaps that exist between NEMWA and the local implementation in the formal and informal parts of the Ekurhuleni Municipality was undertaken in this study. Data on the waste management scenario as collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations revealed that differences relating to the poor establishment of an integrated approach to waste management exist between NEMWA and the local implementation of the act. This was realized through {{the fact that there is}} limited community education on waste management, no waste recycling facilities in some residences, irregular and insufficient collection of waste and non compliance with tariff payments for most informal residents and some formal residents. Differences also exist in the waste management strategies between the formal and informal areas of the municipality primarily due to the fact that the informal settlements are mostly unplanned and considered illegal. According to this study, informal residents are not billed for waste management services and as such most of them do not pay for waste management services. To that <b>end,</b> <b>waste</b> is not efficiently managed due to municipal financial constraints. Waste management challenges in Ekurhuleni Municipality are also attributed to lack of or insufficient knowledge regarding sustainable waste management practices and its benefits amongst the waste generators and some waste management employees.

40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is a US Department of Energy (DOE) {{research}} and development facility for the underground disposal of transuranic waste in southeastern New Mexico. The WIPP repository is located 655 m below the land surface in the lower portion of the Salado Formation, which is comprised of beds of pure and impure halite with thin interbeds of anhydrite and related clay seams. The regional dip of the Salado Formation is approximately 1 {degree} southeast {{in the vicinity of}} the repository. The proposed waste storage area has eight waste disposal panels, each of which will contain seven rooms. The repository is designed to follow a single stratigraphic horizon. Due to the dip, the north end of the repository will be about 10 meters higher than the south <b>end.</b> <b>Waste</b> that is emplaced in the disposal rooms will generate gas due to microbial degradation, anoxic corrosion, and radiolysis. Brine inflow to the rooms from the surrounding Salado Formation may significantly influence the gas generation rate and the total amount of gas generated. The salt surrounding the repository will creep in response to the excavation, reducing the room volume. Gas generation in the room may increase the pressure sufficiently to drive brine and gas into the surrounding Salado Formation. Migration of gas and brine in the Salado is an important factor in evaluating the performance of the repository. The studies summarized in this paper have. been performed to evaluate brine and gas flow processes in the WIPP disposal system and to identify some of the important processes. These studies are done in support of, but are not part of, the formal Performance Assessment (PA) effort. Because of probabilistic and system-scale requirements, the PA effort uses the Sandia-developed BRAGFLO (BRine And Gas FLOw) code for multiphase flow calculations...|$|E
