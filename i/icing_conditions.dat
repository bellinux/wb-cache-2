5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{trends in}} the arctic sea {{transport}} lead to the necessity to determine route specific <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> to ensure safe vessel transits. In order to achieve this, the comprehensive understanding of <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from the past {{should be used to}} predict future trends for arctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> This paper presents the development of such <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> database with the implementation of a satellite data source, which will become a basis for the determination of route specific <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> A case study is performed in order to show how the database could be used to collect the route specific ice data for statistical analyses...|$|R
40|$|Historical sea <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were reconstructed for Izembek Lagoon, Bering Sea, Alaska. This lagoon is {{a crucial}} staging area during {{migration}} for numerous species of avian migrants and a major eelgrass (Zostera marina) area important {{to a variety of}} marine and terrestrial organisms, especially Pacific Flyway black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans). Ice cover is a common feature of the lagoon in winter, but appears to be declining, which has implications for eelgrass distribution and abundance, and its use by wildlife. We evaluated <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from a model based on degree days, calibrated to satellite observations, to estimate distribution and long-term trends in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon. Model results compared favorably with ground observations and 26. years of satellite data, allowing <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> to be reconstructed back to 1943. Specifically, periods of significant (limited access to eelgrass areas) and severe (almost complete ice coverage of the lagoon) <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> could be identified. The number of days of severe ice within a single season ranged from 0 (e. g., 2001) to 2 ̆ 265 67 (e. g., 2000). We detected a slight long-term negative trend in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> superimposed on high inter-annual variability in seasonal aggregate <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on reconstructed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> the seasonally cumulative number of significant or severe ice days correlated linearly with mean air temperature from January until March. Further, air temperature at Izembek Lagoon was correlated with wind direction, suggesting that <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon were associated with synoptic-scale weather patterns. Methods employed in this analysis may be transferable to other coastal locations in the Arctic. 9 2013 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Variations in sea ice extent {{especially}} Antarctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> {{have long}} been considered to influence global climate of the earth. Hence {{the investigation of the}} inter annual variations of Antarctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> is important. A method to analyze the sea <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> by image processing technique is proposed. The sea ice images were photographed by video camera on board the R/V "SHIRASE".

5|$|On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Boston. The {{probable}} cause of the accident was degraded aerodynamic performance beyond the flight capabilities of the aircraft resulting from an accumulation of ice and snow on the airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when the aircraft was flown into moderate to severe <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> following takeoff. Contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and passengers on board, there were seven fatalities with one seriously injured.|$|E
5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between the observed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> and those predicted by the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). The predicted <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were obtained from ice charts prepared by the CIS, and the observed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were made by experienced Ice Observers on board various ice class vessels in different regio ns of the Arctic. The comparison showed that in most cases, the CIS ice predictions provide a reliable description of the actual <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Although there were differences between the predicted and observed conditions, there was no apparent large bias in the data. Additionally, an analysis was done to compare the Ice Numeral calculated from the observed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> within a single 2 ̆ 01 cegg code 2 ̆ 01 d region of an ice chart. This analysis showed {{that there could be}} wide variation in the Ice Numeral within a single egg code region. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

50|$|Although {{in recent}} years {{remotely}} sensed data has come {{to play a major}} role in sea ice analysis, it is not yet possible to compile a complete and accurate picture of sea <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from this data source alone.

25|$|On {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} jet engines, a similar system {{is used for}} wing anti-icing by the 'hot-wing' method. In <b>icing</b> <b>conditions,</b> water droplets condensing on a wing's leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes {{the shape of the}} wing, causing a degradation in performance, and possibly a critical loss of control or lift. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.|$|E
25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two rear mounted turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with autopilot, autothrottle and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, VFR and IFR flights, and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known <b>icing</b> <b>conditions,</b> extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{search and}} rescue {{operations}} were hampered by severe weather {{and the arrival of}} the cold front forecasted by the Pan Am meteorologist. Further complicating search efforts {{was the fact that the}} DC-4 was carrying enough fuel for it to return to Seattle. One newspaper reported Pan American officials as stating that the aircraft was carrying enough fuel to continue flying until 8:40 P.M. Initial search operations were undertaken by the United States Coast Guard as well as the Army Air Force's Alaska command. The army sent B-17s and a C-47 to aid in the search. However snow, fog, heavy winds of , and severe <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> around the airport limited the abilities of searchers and completely hid the crash scene from view.|$|E

25|$|At 18:35 the DC-4 {{departed}} Vancouver International Airport, Canada on {{a scheduled}} flight to Tokyo; {{it was due}} to stop over at Anchorage Airport in Alaska. The flight was on schedule and reported at the Cape Spencer intersection in British Columbia 90 minutes out from Anchorage; it gave an estimate of 24:00 for Yakutat in Alaska. The weather in the area was heavy rain and <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> with a visibility of 500 feet. Nothing further was heard from the aircraft, and at 00:44 an emergency warning was issued when the aircraft was overdue to report. The United States Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force carried out an extensive search but failed to find any trace of the aircraft or its 37 occupants. The search was finally called off on 31 October 1951.|$|E
25|$|The Lynx is an agile helicopter, {{capable of}} {{performing}} loops and rolls, and of attaining high speeds. The agility {{of the type}} led to its use as an aerial display aircraft, having been operated with by the Blue Eagles and Black Cats helicopter display teams. The efficiency of the main rotor, {{as well as the}} overall top speed of the Lynx, was substantially improved with the adoption of BERP rotor blade technology. During the 1990s, the hot-and-high performance of the type was considerably boosted in the later Super Lynx 200 series, at which point the type's Gem engines were replaced with the newer LHTEC T800 turboshaft engine with associated FADEC system; the Lynx can also maintain a good level of performance under moderate <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The FADEC controls eliminated the requirement for a throttle or manual speed selection switches, further simplifying flight control. Later aircraft feature automatic stabilisation equipment; functions such as auto-hover are optionally installed on some Lynx.|$|E
