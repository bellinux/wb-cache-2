5|$|The {{battle has}} been widely {{described}} as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this is incorrect as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from <b>erroneous</b> Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported {{during and after the}} battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that furthered this <b>erroneous</b> narrative. Some of these Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|A {{release date}} was planned for January or February 1973, with the album title rumoured to be The Light That Has Lighted the World. Within a month, {{the title was}} {{announced}} as The Magic Is Here Again, with an <b>erroneous</b> report in Rolling Stone magazine claiming that Eric Clapton was co-producing and that the album was set for release on 20 December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>erroneous</b> use of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) {{and other}} routing {{technology}} to redirect the {{connections to the}} filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from accessing or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem reminiscent of Pakistan's accidental blocking of YouTube {{for much of the}} world instead of only their own citizens.|$|E
5|$|However, their proofs {{that this}} formula is optimal, that is, {{that there can}} be no {{drawings}} with fewer crossings, were <b>erroneous.</b> The gap was not discovered until eleven years after publication, nearly simultaneously by Gerhard Ringel and Paul Kainen.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Christopher Columbus, Irving introduced the <b>erroneous</b> idea that Europeans believed {{the world to}} be flat prior to the discovery of the New World. Borrowed from Irving, the flat-Earth myth has been taught in schools as fact to many generations of Americans.|$|E
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even <b>erroneous</b> statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|There are cables with A plugs on both ends, {{which may}} be valid if the cable includes, for example, a USB host-to-host {{transfer}} device with 2 ports, but they could also be non-standard and <b>erroneous</b> and should be used carefully.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for <b>erroneous</b> depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the <b>erroneous</b> belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E
5|$|After an <b>erroneous</b> {{scouting}} {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1998 {{release of}} Tony Fletcher's Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, Moon's {{date of birth}} was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This <b>erroneous</b> date {{appeared}} in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who. The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This <b>erroneous</b> conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the <b>erroneous</b> assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|Hata, who {{supports}} the retraction of the Kono Statement on comfort women, {{was the only}} historian appointed to the committee established {{by the government of}} Shinzō Abe to re-examine the statement. In 2015 Hata led of group of Japanese historians in requesting that the publisher McGraw-Hill make corrections to what they believed were <b>erroneous</b> descriptions of the comfort women in a world history textbook published in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Heffernan {{sued the}} city, the mayor, and his {{superior}} officers under 42 U.S.C. §1983 {{in the federal}} District Court for New Jersey, claiming that his rights {{of freedom of speech}} as well as freedom of association had been violated. Heffernan contended that while he had not actually engaged in any protected speech, the department acted on the belief that he had, and the department should not have demoted him on the basis of that <b>erroneous</b> belief.|$|E
5|$|Imperator totius orientis (commander-in-chief of {{the entire}} East): only the Augustan History claims that Odaenathus was conferred with this title; the same source also claims that he was made an Augustus (co-emperor) {{following}} his defeat of the Persians. Both claims are dismissed by scholars. Odaenathus {{seems to have been}} acclaimed as Imperator by his troops which is a salutation reserved for the Roman emperor; this acclamation might explain the <b>erroneous</b> reports of the Augustan History.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be <b>erroneous,</b> as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
5|$|In times past, bright comets often {{inspired}} {{panic and}} hysteria {{in the general}} population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and <b>erroneous</b> newspaper reports inspired a fear that cyanogen in the tail might poison millions, whereas the appearance of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus was {{described}} in a 2009 paper authored by Xu et al. in the journal Nature. The description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association: the holotype, IVPP V 15923, is an almost complete articulated (i.e. with the bones laid out {{as they were in}} life) skeleton; and the other, IVPP V 15304, is a likewise almost complete articulated specimen, only missing the skull. The second specimen is 15% larger than the holotype. These specimens have also respectively been referred to by the <b>erroneous</b> specimen numbers IVPP V 15924 and IVPP V 16134.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that <b>erroneous</b> premise, Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were further complicated by <b>erroneous</b> reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage and the {{condition}} of West Bridge led to some <b>erroneous</b> reports of her loss. News articles on 24 August in both The New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune reported the loss of West Bridge, and the mistaken information also made it into book form. Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson, in their work The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918, repeat the misinformation {{about the loss of}} West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{chemical}} {{diversity among}} actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, {{but also in}} the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved <b>erroneous.</b> The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} {{irregularities}} {{has been discovered}} concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and <b>erroneous</b> entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an <b>erroneous</b> {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed {{such a move}} preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (West Africa) Division {{could be used in}} its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an <b>erroneous</b> report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E
5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial <b>erroneous</b> assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is <b>erroneous</b> because {{the law does not}} apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Nanticoke Creek, {{like the}} nearby Nanticoke city and Nanticoke Falls, {{is named for}} a group of Nanticoke People who for a time had a village in the Wyoming Valley before Europeans settled there. The creek was known as Muddy Run on some very early maps of the area. However, its current name was {{appearing}} on maps as early as 1776. The creek has also historically been referred to by many other names, including Lee's Creek, Miller's Creek, Robbins Creek, Bobbs Creek, Rummage Creek, and Warrior Run Creek. All of these names were described as <b>erroneous</b> in Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|One {{strategy}} that received increasing consideration in NSC meetingsas {{well as at}} the US Embassy, Saigon and in Congresswas a suspension of non-military aid to Diệm. After the <b>erroneous</b> Voice of America broadcast on August 26, which announced an aid suspension, Lodge was given the discretion on August 29 to suspend aid if it would facilitate a coup. In the meantime, the US Senate began to pressure the administration to take action against Diệm. Hilsman was lobbied by the Senate Subcommittee on the Far East. Senator Frank Church informed the administration of his intention to introduce a resolution condemning Diệm's anti-Buddhist repression and calling for the termination of aid unless religious equality was instituted. This resulted in Church agreeing to temporarily delay the introduction of the bill to avoid embarrassing the administration.|$|E
5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was <b>erroneous,</b> because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 18th century, when Brazil was still a colony, the {{government}} had attempted to gather data regarding the population. However, few captaincies (later called provinces) collected the requested information. After independence the government instituted a commission for statistics in an 1829 decree with a mandate to hold a national census. The commission was a failure and was disbanded in 1834. In the ensuing years, provincial governments were tasked with collecting census information, but their census reports were often incomplete or not submitted at all. In 1851, another attempt at a nationwide census failed when rioting broke out. This was the result of the <b>erroneous</b> belief among Brazilians of mixed-race descent that the survey was a subterfuge designed to enslave anyone having African blood.|$|E
5|$|Strombid {{gastropods}} {{were widely}} accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, {{a concept that}} persisted until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. This <b>erroneous</b> idea originated in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore, that feeds on macroalgae (including red algae, such as species of Gracilaria and Hypnea), seagrass and unicellular algae, intermittently also feeding on algal detritus. The green macroalgae Batophora oerstedii is one of its preferred foods.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused <b>erroneous</b> anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Russian army {{numbered}} nearly 98,000. It was {{commanded by}} generals Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky. The Russians {{also had an}} advantage in combat experience. The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine, taking Kamieniec Podolski, Chełm and Lublin, and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south. Krechetnikov was to advance through Minsk, Wilno, Brześć Litewski and Białystok, and approach Warsaw from the north, where he was to link with Kakhovsky. Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland, and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength; the Poles had much less intelligence, receiving contradictory and often <b>erroneous</b> reports, and unsure whether the war would even start {{up to the point}} the Russian troops crossed the border.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the <b>erroneous</b> belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E
