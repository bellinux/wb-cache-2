25|$|VIL {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} the potential for downburst, too. A convective downdraft is linked to three forces in the vertical, namely perturbation pressure gradient force, buoyancy force and precipitation loading. The pressure gradient force was neglected as it has significant effect only on the updraft in supercells. With this assumption and other simplifications (e.g. requiring the environment of the air parcel to be static on the time scale of the downdraft). The resulting momentum equation is integrated over height to yield the kinetic energy of the parcel on descending to the surface and is found to be the negative CAPE of a dry air parcel injected into the storm, plus de motion of the convective cell. S. R. Stewart, from NWS, has published in 1991 an equation relating VIL and the echo tops that give the potential for surface gust using this concept. This is a predictive result that gives a certain lead time. With the <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> data, the meteorologist can see the downdraft and gust fronts happening, but since this a small scale feature, detection algorithms have been developed to point convergence and divergence areas under a thunderstorm on the radar display.|$|E

2500|$|Helioseismic holography, {{introduced}} in detail by Lindsey and Braun {{for the purpose}} of far-side (magnetic) imaging, a special case of phase-sensitive holography. The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions {{on the far side of}} the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocity</b> observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like seismic migration, a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare. Acoustic holography, applied to MDI data, is ideal for the detection of sources and sinks of acoustic waves on the Sun. Braun and Fan [...] discovered a region of lower acoustic emission in the 3 – 4 mHz frequency band which extends far beyond the sunspots (the ‘acoustic moat’). Acoustic moats extend beyond magnetic regions into the quiet Sun. In addition, Braun and Lindsey [...] discovered high-frequency emission (‘acoustic glories’) surrounding active regions.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper was to develop an {{automated}} dealiasing scheme that dealiases <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> measured by a bistatic Doppler radar network. The particular network consists of the C-band polarimetric diversity Doppler radar, POLDIRAD, and three passive receivers located at remote sites. The wind components, inde-pendent but measured simultaneously, are then merged to a horizontal wind vector field. In order to dealias these independent wind components separately, the real-time four-dimensional Doppler dealiasing scheme (4 DD) developed by James and Houze was modified. In altering 4 DD, the main difficulties arose from dealiasing bistatically measured <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities,</b> the spatial data inhomogeneity, and to a lesser extent, from the small spatial coverage of bistatic data due to the limited size of the bistatic antenna’s aperture. Furthermore, an internal dealiasing algorithm was added to 4 DD that uses the full wind vector information to optimize dealising of small isolated cells. Because the determination of microphysical and dynamical parameters requires alternating or fixed polarization bases, respectively, two different scanning strategies are developed to determine these param-eters effectively during both slowly and rapidly evolving weather events. An example is presented of dealiasing monostatically and bistatically measured <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> which were acquired using both scanning modes to observe a downburst-producing thunderstorm. 1...|$|R

40|$|In astrophysical {{systems with}} {{partially}} ionized plasma {{the motion of}} ions is governed by the magnetic field while the neutral particles can only feel the magnetic field's Lorentz force indirectly through collisions with ions. The drift in the velocity between ionized and neutral species {{plays a key role}} in modifying important physical processes like magnetic reconnection, damping of magnetohydrodynamic waves, transport of angular momentum in plasma through the magnetic field, and heating. This paper investigates the differences between <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> of calcium ions and neutral hydrogen in a solar prominence to look for velocity differences between the neutral and ionized species. We simultaneously observed spectra of a prominence over an active region in H I 397 nm, H I 434 nm, Ca II 397 nm, and Ca II 854 nm using a high dispersion spectrograph of the Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida observatory, and compared the <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities,</b> derived from the shift of the peak of the spectral lines presumably emitted from optically-thin plasma. There are instances when the difference in velocities between neutral atoms and ions is significant, e. g. 1433 events (~ 3 % of sets of compared profiles) with a difference in velocity between neutral hydrogen atoms and calcium ions greater than 3 sigma of the measurement error. However, we also found significant differences between the <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> of two spectral lines emitted from the same species, and the probability density functions of velocity difference between the same species is not significantly different from those between neutral atoms and ions. We interpreted the difference of <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> as a result of motions of different components in the prominence along the line of sight, rather than the decoupling of neutral atoms from plasma.

The evolution of the flow with time, which is mainly due to appearance of velocity packets called Evershed clouds (ECs), may provide information to further constrain its origin. Aims. We undertake {{a detailed analysis of}} the evolution of the Evershed flow by studying the properties of ECs. In this first paper we determine the sizes, proper motions, location in the penumbra, and frequency of appearance of ECs, as well as their typical <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities,</b> linear and circular polarization signals, Stokes V area asymmetries, and continuum intensities. Methods. High-cadence, high-resolution, full vector spectropolarimetric measurements in visible and infrared lines are used to characterize the ECs phenomenon through a simple line-parameter analysis as well as more complex Stokes inversions. Results. We find that ECs appear in the mid penumbra and propage outward along filaments with large linear polarization signals and enhanced Evershed flows. The frequency of appearance of ECs varies between 15 and 40 minutes in different filaments. ECs exhibit the largest <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocities</b> and linear-to-circular polarization ratios of the whole penumbra.
