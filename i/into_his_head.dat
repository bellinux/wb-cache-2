5|$|Jason {{made his}} first {{cinematic}} appearance in the original Friday the 13th on May 9, 1980. In this film, Jason is portrayed in the memories of his mother, Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer), and as a hallucination of the film's protagonist, Alice (Adrienne King). Though the character makes no contemporary appearance onscreen, he propels the film's plot—Mrs. Voorhees, the cook at Camp Crystal Lake, seeks revenge for his death, which she blames on the camp counselors. Jason's second appearance was in the sequel, Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981). Revealed to be alive, an adult Jason exacts revenge on Alice for decapitating his mother in the original film. Jason (Steven Dash and Warrington Gillette), returns to Crystal Lake, living there as a hermit and guarding it from all intruders. Five years later a group of teenagers arrive {{to set up a}} new camp, only to be murdered one by one by Jason, who wears a pillow case over his head to hide his face. Ginny (Amy Steel), the lone survivor, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees, and surrounded by mutilated corpses. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. In Friday the 13th PartIII (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) escapes to a nearby lake resort, Higgins Haven, to rest from his wounds. At the same time, Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) returns to the property with some friends. An unmasked and reclusive Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, he leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris fends off Jason by slamming an axe <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.|$|E

500|$|Asylum also {{enhanced}} some of Jason's signature machete kills.

Then, Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect. For this scene, Asylum adjusted the actor's facial expressions to create a [...] "post mortem" [...] look.

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...".

[...] It was next performed on 2 April 1987 in Tempe, Arizona, {{during the first}} concert of The Joshua Tree Tour. Clayton noted that {{the manner in which}} they created the song inadvertently caused a problem for U2, saying [...] "when you're in a touring situation you have to learn numbers that were never actually written so much as spontaneously created." [...] "Exit" [...] was played at all 109 concerts on the tour, and was frequently followed by a snippet of the Them song [...] "Gloria", which was written by Van Morrison Following the conclusion of the Joshua Tree Tour, U2 performed [...] "Exit" [...] on only one more occasion; 14 October 1989 in Melbourne, Australia, on the Lovetown Tour, almost two years after the previous performance of the song.

Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse.

500|$|Elgar is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930.

When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the [...] "trio") of the first march came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> he told his friend Dora Penny, [...] "I've got a tune that will knock 'em– will knock 'em flat". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience [...] "rose and yelled ... the one and only {{time in the history of}} the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore." [...] To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, [...] "Land of Hope and Glory", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as [...] "Pomp and Circumstance" [...] or [...] "The Graduation March", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.|$|E
