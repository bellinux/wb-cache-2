The ship-launched version C-101 and the air-launched version YJ-1 both have integrated fire control system to meet the tight space requirement on board ships and aircraft, where the coastal defense version FL-2 has a <b>distributed</b> <b>fire</b> control system, where power, radar, and operator consoles are located separately to reduce the possible damage from enemy attacks. This is a practice commonly adopted by other Chinese missiles such as Silkworm missiles. The NATO reporting name for this missile is CSSC-5 Saple. The development of C-101 missile started in the late 1970s, and production began in the mid-1990s, as part of the replacement of the obsolete HY-2/CSS-N-2 missiles. The Chinese Navy tested the C-101 anti-ship missile on the Hoku-class missile boat, and Huang-class missile boat are being fitted with four C-101 launch tubes, while smaller classes carry two launch tubes. The air-launched version has been reportedly carried on the H-5 and Xi’an H-6 bombers and the Harbin SH-5 amphibian and eventually expanded to most of the aircraft in the Chinese inventory.

40|$|TechCon 2017 (CRUSER) Presented by Dr. Doug Horner: NPS Mechanical & Aerospace Eng. Power projection, domain {{awareness}} and area denial have fundamentally {{changed with the}} advent of unmanned systems. Unmanned Aerial, Surface, Ground and Undersea Systems (UxS) can be used effectively to bring forces from sea to shore. To gain greatest utility from such a system, one must take advantage of the inherent strengths while mitigating the weaknesses associated with the sensing, mobility and communications of each of the individual platforms. Additionally, the UxS should be adaptable in its ability to support on ground forces through distributed or centralized control. This research initiative views the UxS as a single system – a Network Control System (NCS). The research question is how to develop a mathematical and experimental framework for the NCS that supports the development of autonomy within the system. Central to the effort is the communications topology. It determines the ability to spread information throughout the network. It is not necessary that all components of the system be connected at all times, only that information is transmitted through the network in a methodology that effectively supports mission objectives. This presentation describes upcoming CRUSER experimentation at San Clemente Island (SCI) which seeks to demonstrate an initial UxS using a mesh communications infrastructure. It will describe an initial hierarchical approach that combines optimal trajectories of UxS collaborative components with coordination for optimizing communications between aerial vehicles.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to predict {{if there is a}} risk for fire smoke spread through a ventilation systems and it is often required analytical design for verifying adequate fire protection. Different simulation programs are used today to verify the protection against fire of the ventilation system. FDS is a simulation program which by edition six came with an additional function, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) where natural- and mechanical ventilation may be simulated using a system built by nodes and ducts. The function also allows leakage to be simulated in a computationally more stable way than before. The HVAC function is indirectly coupled to the CFD calculations in FDS to avoid dividing the system in grid cells which would have required far more computing capacity. HVAC has been validated against full-scale test with satisfactory results. This study aims to investigate how the HVAC function can be used in analytical design and investigate its limitations and user friendliness. Four parameter studies was performed using FDS and HVAC where the fire compartment size-, the wind-, the material selection and the leak impact on inter alia pressure, temperature and amount fire smoke spread was investigated. The model was built in form of an apartment building with two apartment floors and one attic with belonging FT-system with fans in operation. The result showed that the main risk for fire smoke spread through the ventilation system appeared in the early course of the fire development where the increase of the temperature was greatest. The possibility of decompression in the fire compartment was also a factor which had high impact on the fire smoke spread through the ventilation system where an increase in pressure relief reduced the spread. A volume reduction of the fire compartment decreased the amount <b>distributed</b> <b>fire</b> smoke in the initial stage and the wind factor reduced the spread but increased the fire effect after the windows broke. The heat resistance of the windows was also of significance when looking at the amount of fire smoke spread through the ventilation system, why the temperature for window failure is something that should be investigated further. The suitability of using the HVAC function to verify ventilation systems against fire is considered to be good. However, the programs application area for the different functions requires good knowledge to achieve satisfactory results. It is noticeable that the function is new since certain variables, such as the duct temperature and the self-designed fan curve, are not yet fully developed in function and construction. Construction of advanced ventilation systems and other types of buildings should also be implemented in the program and validated against full-scale experiments.

40|$|AbstractWe prove {{a strong}} lower bound {{on the number}} of rounds of message {{exchange}} required to achieve simultaneity (i. e., action in the same round) in certain synchronous fault-tolerant distributed systems. Specifically, our bound holds for any randomized protocol which solves either the simultaneous agreement problem or the <b>distributed</b> <b>firing</b> squad problem. It is known that any protocol that solves either of these problems and that is resilient to t processor faults has at least one execution that lasts at least t + 1 rounds. We strengthen that bound by showing that all normal executions of such a protocol last at least t + 1 rounds. The restriction to normal executions is a technical one that excludes certain executions in which a fortuitous pattern of processor faults enables early termination. The lower bounds proved in this paper contrast with known protocols that achieve agreement on a value (without simultaneity) in fewer than t + 1 rounds in some normal executions. Our results are proved for randomized protocols, for a benign failure model (crash faults), and for a weak adversary. They apply a fortiori to deterministic protocols, more malicious failure models, and stronger adversaries...|$|R

These problems require that the correct processors coordinate their actions in some way but place no restrictions {{on the behavior of}} the faulty processors. In systems with benign processor failures, however, it is reasonable to require that the actions of a faulty processor be consistent with those of the correct processors, assuming it performs any action at all. We consider problems requiring consistent, simultaneous coordination. We then analyze these problems in terms of common knowledge in several failure models. The analysis of these stronger problems requires a stronger definition of common knowledge, and we study the relationship between these two de nitions. In many cases, the two de nitions are actually equivalent, and simple modifications of previous solutions yield round-optimal solutions to these problems. When the definitions differ, however, we show that such problems cannot be solved, even in failure-free executions...|$|R
