25|$|The <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test is {{used when}} two {{separate}} sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, one {{from each of}} the two populations being compared. For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50subjects to the treatment group and 50subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> and would use the unpaired form of the t-test. The randomization is not essential here – if we contacted 100people by phone and obtained each person's age and gender, and then used a two-sample t-test to see whether the mean ages differ by gender, this would also be an <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test, even though the data are observational.|$|E
25|$|In principle, Monte Carlo {{methods can}} be used to solve any problem having a {{probabilistic}} interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the sample mean) of <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parametrized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.|$|E

In this paper, a new strategy for <b>independent</b> <b>sampling</b> of building blocks (<b>independent</b> <b>sampling</b> genetic algorithms (ISGAs)) is proposed in order to nicely implement implicit parallelism.

2500|$|One {{possible}} {{way to reduce}} the number of inversions to only a few while obtaining a large number of samples is the application of the [...] so-called the Stochastic Collocation Monte Carlo sampler (SCMC sampler), within a polynomial chaos expansion framework, allows us the generation of any number of Monte Carlo samples based on only a few inversions of the original distribution and <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> from a variable for which the inversions are analytically available, like for example the standard normal variable.|$|E

2500|$|Information {{theory is}} based on {{probability}} theory and statistics. [...] Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are entropy, a measure of information in a single random variable, and mutual information, a measure of information in common between two random variables. [...] The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on {{the rate at which}} data generated by <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> with the given distribution can be reliably compressed. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy channel in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.|$|E

Conover and Iman provided a review of the four main types of rank transformations (RT). One method replaces each original data value by its rank (from 1 for the smallest to N for the largest). This rank-based procedure has been recommended as being robust to non-normal errors, resistant to outliers, and highly efficient for many distributions. It may result in a known statistic (e.g., in the two <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> layout ranking results in the Wilcoxon rank-sum / Mann-Whitney U test), and provides the desired robustness and increased statistical power that is sought.
