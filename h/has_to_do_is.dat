5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> squeeze.|$|E

I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E
500|$|Outside the school, Winn and a {{group of}} Bajorans protest Keiko's {{teaching}} methods. Winn offers Keiko a solution—all she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> simply stop teaching about the wormhole. When Keiko refuses to accept Winn's proposal, Winn leads the Bajoran parents to take their children out of school. Sisko visits Vedek Bareil (Philip Anglim) for advice on the problem. [...] Bareil opposes Winn's views but he cannot support Sisko as he is attempting to become the next Kai, the leader of the Bajoran religion. Sisko returns to DS9 and asks for help from Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), but she also refuses to help. Meanwhile, Odo (René Auberjonois) and Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) finish investigating the remains of the Starfleet ensign Miles and Neela found earlier. [...] They discover that the ensign had been murdered by a phaser when he became aware of someone tampering with the Runabout security controls.|$|E

After months of waiting for her call sheet, Shankar eventually offered the role to Sadha. Expressing hope that it would be [...] "an important movie" [...] in her career, Sadha accepted the offer, working on the film for 120 days, adding, [...] "I have a major role to play in Anniyan. There are few heavy portions involving me in the movie that I have given my best." [...] She considered being a part of a Shankar film, especially during the early stages of her career, as a [...] "god's gift" [...] and a [...] "once-in-a-lifetime experience". However, when offered similar roles following the film's success, she refused to be typecast and stated, [...] "I am now looking for roles where my creative potential is tapped. I don't {{want to be part of}} such cinema where all one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> dance around trees." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) informs Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{that her}} {{unlicensed}} Janis Joplin biopic {{is hard to}} sell due to test audiences not liking it. They decide to up the PR {{by going to the}} Kids Choice Awards where Jenna discovers that she is dead. She is accidentally put in the memorial montage at the show, which Jack decides to use as an advantage for the film. He tells her that all she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> stay {{out of the public eye}} until he sells the movie. At the same time, all employees from the 30 Rock building need to disclose any inter-office relationships. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) discloses that he fantasizes about marrying a TGS dancer, named Daphne (Danielle Flora), but discovers that [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) is dating her. A minor conflict ensues between them, but ends when Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to mediate this. As a result, Tracy fires Daphne, but this backfires when the other dancers refuse to work. This prompts Tracy to solve this problem by hiring new dancers.|$|E
500|$|Talks {{about the}} 2014 NBA draft began awkwardly when Paul Stauskas told Sports Illustrated about his son, Nik: [...] "He knows all he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> keep his {{nose to the}} {{grindstone}} for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go pro." [...] Several days later Stauskas tried to distance himself from his father's statement, apologizing to his fans. After the season Stauskas, Robinson and McGary said that they were considering entering the draft, but had not made a decision. Each submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, which was required to respond by April 14 (giving the players until April 27 to declare their eligibility). On April 10 it was reported that Stauskas had decided to turn pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein (father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr.) as his agent. In an April 15 joint press conference on the Big Ten Network, Robinson and Stauskas announced that they were declaring their eligibility for the NBA draft. When he learned that he had tested positive for marijuana after the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary also entered the draft.|$|E
500|$|Rita (Laura Elena Harring) is {{the mysterious}} and {{helpless}} apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert {{was so impressed}} with Harring that he said of her [...] "all she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> stand there and she is the first good argument in 55years for a Gilda remake". She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire {{to make sense of the}} film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is [...] "the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her". A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.|$|E

500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows all he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> keep his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within the next week or so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

Assiac observed of the first, [...] "This sounds like a formidable proposition, but it really isn't.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "having the same number" [...] or [...] "having the same cardinality" [...] can be {{captured}} {{by the idea of}} one-to-one correspondence. [...] This (purely definitional) assumption is sometimes known as Hume's principle. [...] As Frege said, [...] "If a waiter wishes to be certain of laying exactly as many knives on a table as plates, he has no need to count either of them; all he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to lay immediately to the right of every plate a knife, taking care that every knife on the table lies immediately to the right of a plate. [...] Plates and knives are thus correlated one to one." [...] Sets in such a correlation are called equinumerous, and the correlation is called a one-to-one correspondence.|$|E

He expanded that role in Ira Levin's full-length theatrical version of the same name (October 1955) on Broadway in New York City. The role earned him a [...] "Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor" [...] nomination at the 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. [...] "Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale" [...] (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. [...] "All he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face.

2500|$|Hirsh {{had good}} leverage, pitched down to hitters, {{and had a}} refined {{repertoire}} of pitches. [...] He had a [...] "plus" [...] 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91–94mph, and threw a [...] "filthy" [...] hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80–86mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). [...] Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. [...] He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94–96mph range. [...] He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to {{both sides of the}} plate. [...] "I'm 6-foot-8 and I keep a high three-quarters arm angle," [...] noted Hirsh. [...] "You figure the mound is a foot and a half, and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. [...] It makes the batter have to look up instead of straight at me, and he may have a difficult time adjusting." [...] During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: [...] "All Jason <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> trust his stuff. [...] He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch —- to try and trick hitters." ...|$|E
