50|$|Given {{the simple}} binary {{information}} that is carried by signal digital, {{it is clear that}} multiple signals must be used to describe analog information. Generally, this is done by using an assemblage of digital levels to construct a binary number, often called a word. The individuals digital levels are referred to as bits of the word. Thus, for example, a 6-bit word consists of six independent digital levels, such as , which cab=n be thought of as six-digit base 2 number.

5000|$|In {{the context}} of digital signal {{processing}} (DSP), a digital signal is a discrete-time signal for which not only the time but also the amplitude has discrete values; in other words, its samples take on only values from a discrete set (a countable set that can be mapped one-to-one to a subset of integers).

5000|$|To {{address some}} of these issues, a new studio format has been developed, usually {{referred}} to as DSD-wide, which retains the high sample rate of standard DSD, but uses an 8-bit, rather than single-bit <b>digital</b> <b>word</b> length, yet still relies heavily on the noise shaping principle. DSD-wide is PCM with noise shaping—and is sometimes disparagingly referred to as [...] "PCM-narrow"—but has {{the added benefit of}} making DSP operations in the studio a great deal more practical. The main difference is that [...] "DSD-wide" [...] still retains 2.8224 MHz (64Fs) sampling frequency while the highest frequency in which PCM is being edited is 384 kHz (8Fs). The [...] "DSD-wide" [...] signal is down-converted to regular DSD for SACD mastering. As a result of this technique and other developments there are now a few digital audio workstations (DAWs) that operate, or can operate, in the DSD domain, notably Pyramix and some SADiE systems.|$|E
5000|$|A main {{critique}} of media theory in practice deals with time constraints. Many First-Year Composition teachers complain {{that there is}} not enough time in the course to teach digital writing in addition to [...] "regular" [...] writing. This often results in the addition of new media production as a last-minute addendum, [...] "as a strategy for adding relevance or interest to a required course. Only rarely does that call address students as producers as well as consumers or critics".Related to this, teachers are also frequently concerned {{that they do not have}} the ability or knowledge required to teach writing with new media and multi-modality to students because they are often unfamiliar with constantly evolving technologies. A separate criticism is that new media use allows for more prevalent plagiarism. As more information is available on the Internet, it is much easier to simply [...] "copy-paste" [...] data into a new format. Furthermore, the questionable authorship of many digital texts complicates things both in terms of writing and citing works. Multi-media works are especially subject to concern over criticism as appropriation and remixing are rampant and even encouraged in composition classrooms and as debates over SOPA occur. [...] Many word processing programs have also been seen to reinforce norms and hierarchies. For instance, the commonly used spelling and grammar checkers of certain programs can be seen as possibly halting the natural progression of language and the creative use of it by encouraging writers to stay within the realm of standard vernaculars. [...] Furthermore, some cite the highly class-based symbolic nature of many <b>digital</b> <b>word</b> processing systems. Hierarchies are also potentially reaffirmed with implications of the word [...] "new" [...] in [...] "new media". While media theory aims to expand writers' view of modality, a society caught up in modernism is prone to believe that [...] "newness" [...] will result in social progress, as fostered in this case by technological advances, by equating [...] "new" [...] and [...] "better". Furthermore, class-based issues of access may serve to reinforce existing social structures; as those who are unable to access advanced technology fall behind in composition-based technological capabilities, they will be less able to compete in the job market and are likely to reaffirm the separation between classes. This is especially true in K-12 writing programs, as there are often economic differences between students and school districts. However, issues of access are disputed as technology becomes more available to the general public. Patricia Fitzsimmons-Hunter and Charles Moran, aware of these issues of access and their inevitable consequences, notably use technology that is friendlier to class-differences:"We consider as our goal the integration of low-end, relatively affordable technology into the lives and work of those who are, or see themselves as being, left behind by the pace of the technological change: [...] "roadkill," [...] to use a popular contemporary metaphor, on the information superhighway." [...] One of the most cited shortcomings of new media composition is that many teachers are unsure how to assess the writing. Oftentimes, teachers are only familiar with the standards that traditional text is held to. Texts written in new media encounter different rhetorical situations and contexts, and thus do not fit the standards that teachers are familiar with. Furthermore, these new texts often combine text with non-textual modes of communication, like the visual or auditory, making the situation for grading a [...] "written work" [...] even more complex.|$|E
