40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the standards relative to technical exigencies and CE marking that correspond to photovoltaic inverters of low voltage (less than 5 Â kW) as marketed in Spain. For this study, around 400 different models of inverters from the European market were compiled. Twelve of them, 50 Â Hz single phase, were chosen, made up of different brands and options of transformer below 5 Â kW. For these inverters, regulations for each model were examined according to their data sheet specifications, manual and <b>EC</b> <b>Declarations</b> of Conformity. Heterogeneity in compliance to the standards was found. In addition, in view of results obtained it is possible to conclude that it would be wise to establish a common set of standards for every country in the world (or at least a common European normalization) according to PV grid inverters. It would enable all grid inverters to be commercialised in compliance with the same standards everywhere.

While this is not new to dryland farming, 'irrigation drought' is uncharted territory. Australia {{has always had a}} variable climate, with drought being a recurring feature. Looking to the future, experts predict higher temperatures and, for some regions, more frequent periods of exceptionally low rainfall. Most farmers are sufficiently self-reliant to manage climate variability. The National Drought Policy's (NDP) Exceptional Circumstance (<b>EC)</b> <b>declarations</b> and related drought assistance programs do not help farmers improve their self-reliance, preparedness and climate change management. Governments need to commit to a long term reform path that recognises that the primary responsibility for managing risks, including from climate variability and change, rests with farmers. Similar recommendations from the previous reviews of the NDP have not been adopted. To ensure that this new policy direction is credible and enduring: the NDP should be replaced with extended objectives for Australia’s Farming Future; and an intergovernmental agreement with independent monitoring and financial incentives for complying with agreed commitments should be established. drought, irrigation, rainfall, drought assistance programs...|$|E

An Exceptional Circumstance <b>declaration</b> (<b>EC)</b> was used as a proxy for adverse climate events. The Australian government may provide financial support to people living in EC areas, i. e. areas experiencing a one in 20 – 25 year event (drought, flood or fire) that results in a severe, extended downturn in farm or farm-related income. Methods: Data from 6, 584 53 – 58 year old non-metropolitan women participating in the 2004 survey of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) were linked to EC data. Generalised linear models were used to analyse differences in SF- 36 General Health (GH) and Mental Health (MH) and perceived stress by EC for all women. Models were adjusted for demographic, health-related and psychosocial factors potentially on the pathway between EC and health. Given that the effects on health were expected to be greater in vulnerable people, analyses were repeated for women with worse socioeconomic circumstances. Results: GH, MH and stress did not differ for the 3, 366 women in EC areas and 3, 218 women in non-EC areas. GH, MH and stress were worse among vulnerable women (who had difficulty managing on available income) regardless of EC. Conclusion and implications: This research adds to the existing literature on climate change, associated adverse climate events and health, by suggesting that multiple resources available in high income countries, including government support and individual psychosocial resources may mitigate some of the health impacts of adverse climate events, even among vulnerable people...|$|R
40|$|Louk Box et. al. (2003) Review of Science and Technology {{plans in}} ACP countries, University of Maastricht, Maastricht. Chapter 3. 2 : S&T and {{international}} development organizations European Commission In 2001, the Commission acknowledged {{the importance of}} Agricultural Research for Development (ARD), and adopted a strategy to promote the European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD) and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), as well as regional research networks such as CORAF, ASARECA, SACCAR, CIRDES and ICIMOD (Vialatte, 2001). In 2002, {{this was followed by}} a strategy document ´Support to ARD at sub-regional level´ (Vialatte, 2002), which focused on NARS and on regional and international systems as well as research implementation. Organizations assumed to participate in this initiative are FARA, GFAR and the CGIAR. The CGIAR plays an important role due to its expertise and partnerships at regional and national levels (EC, 2000 a,b). In preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg in 2002, the ACP-EU Forum on Research for Sustainable development was held in Cape Town (EC, 2002 c; EU, 2002). The ministers discussed agriculture as one aspect of general environmental issues. Although no formal decision was taken, the conclusions of the Forum were included in the Cape Town <b>Declaration</b> (<b>EC,</b> 2002 a). Moreover, the ´Competitive Grant Scheme for Agricultural Research for Development in Sub-Saharan Africa´ identifies major challenges for the new Framework Programme (2002 - 2006) to establish an integrated European research area. At the end of the Forum, ACP and Commission officials issued the Cape Town Plan of Action (Bellemin, 2002; EC, 2002 b). This was a first step towards establishing an S&T dialogue within ACP countries, and to the further internationalization of European research aimed at global sustainable development. The Plan of Action defines strategic areas in the agricultural and agro-industrial sectors, with special attention to the relation between biotechnology, agro-industrial technologies and ICTs. The plan can be regarded as an interesting first attempt to formulate a coherent S&T policy {{within the framework of the}} Cotonou Agreement. No formal government commitments have yet been made, however. Such commitments are needed before effective research strategies can be developed at the ACP or EU levels. Such strategies could be linked to the activities undertaken under the Commission´s 6 th Framework Programme (EC, 2002 d, 2003). The linkage with the Framework Programme could help to improve coordination within the Commission. As long ago as 1996, the RAWOO (Advisory Council for Development Research) suggested that the Commission could build on the former INCO programme. It also stressed the need for closer coordination in the fields of agriculture and health, since the issues involved need to be dealt with in a multidisciplinary approach. The conclusion to be drawn from the various reports is that the Commission does have an instrument for S&T cooperation with ACP countries. Even though limited reference is made to S&T in the Country Strategy Papers, agricultural research programmes could undoubtedly benefit from support under the Framework Programme coordinated by DG Research. However, its procedures differ substantially from those under the Cotonou Agreement. World Bank Over the past 20 years the World Bank has financed many S&T projects, including support and loans to CGIAR, SPAAR, UN organizations, SIDA, IDRC, sub-Saharan agriculture and S&T capacity building (especially in agriculture; see Daly, 1999, 2000). Crawford and Brezenhoff (2001), however, concluded that over this period the World Bank has had no consistent approach or strategy in developing the scientific and technological capacities in client countries. They called for projects that would encourage greater cooperation among client countries. A first step should be to promote interaction among the Bank staff working on S&T issues. In 2002, however, the Bank issued a strategy paper that signified a change in its approach to S&T and development (World Bank, 2002). It established an internal S&T thematic group (which included representatives of the CGIAR) to raise awareness of S&T and its role in development, and to foster collaboration with a wide range of international partners such as OECD, UNESCO, and the Third World Academy of Sciences. The World Bank is currently redefining its strategy regarding S&T, aiming at better integration of the various actors. OECD The OECD has been at the forefront of S&T studies, although few of these documents were located. One exception was the ´OECD/DAC Donor-Developing Country Dialogues on National Strategies for Sustainable Development´, which deals with capacity building, planning and management in Tanzania, highlighting the role of village communities (OECD, 2001). However, neither S&T nor agriculture are referred to explicitly in the study. FARA The Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) is the successor to the World Bank´s Special Programme for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR). In 2002 FARA launched a Multi-country Agricultural Productivity Programme (MAPP) for Africa for the period 2003 - 2012 (FARA, 2002 b). The programme, developed by FARA and NEPAD, shows the need for national agricultural technology delivery systems (NATDS). The paper, however, focuses on programme development in countries that meet certain eligibility criteria, such as satisfactory macroeconomic conditions and sector policy support, an operational agricultural technology generation with transfer, and government commitment. FARA´s 2002 strategy document highlights the Forum´s support to NARS, SROs, IARS, the CGIAR and the private sector. FARA´s budget has been extended to 2012, and the forum is recruiting new staff (FARA, 2002 a). As one of the major coordinating bodies for agricultural research in Africa, FARA is a key agency. Through its relation with NEPAD, a link between agricultural S&T policies and general development policies could be made. NEPAD In its medium-term programme for 2003 - 2005, the New Partnership for Africa´s Development (NEPAD) intends to strengthen cooperation among NGOs, especially those focusing on biotechnology, ICTs and national innovation systems (NEPAD, 2002 b). This emphasis on NGO cooperation is novel for African governments and could represent an interesting opening for organizations such as CTA. NEPAD also stressed the benefits of voluntary participation and the corresponding contribution of governments. In 2003, NEPAD established the African Forum on Science and Technology for Development (AFSTD) to promote the application of S&T for economic growth and poverty reduction. The Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), launched by FAO and NEPAD (2002) for the period 2002 - 2015, identifies three areas for improvement (budget US$ 204. 5 billion) and, in the long term, agricultural research, technology dissemination and adoption, with a budget of US$ 136. 2 billion (NEPAD, 2002 a). Whereas NEPAD´s medium-term programme stresses voluntary participation, this could become an overall programme with significant budgets for agriculture and agricultural research. At a time when the funds for agricultural research are declining, the programme offers a sign of hope. UN According to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the UN is interested in setting up a global programme or New Partnership for Science and Technology and Society for Sustainable Development (UN, 2002). After the publication of the UNDP´s Human Development Report 2001, the UN´s emphasis on S&T indicates acceptance of this issue at the global level. As always, however, the issue of funding will first have to be resolved. Regional studies and plans AFRICA - General After decades of minimal interest, investment in S&T programmes appears to be increasing. UNESCO´s Science Report 2002 : Africa (Gaillard et al., 2002), for example, notes that during the 1990 s donors and developing country governments showed little interest in S&T for development, but the situation is now changing. The authors emphasize that Africa must devise long-term strategies to build the capacity of the continent´s scientific infrastructure, and to improve the conditions for scientists, such as by offering adequate salaries and reasonable career opportunities. In an unpublished document (2002), ISNAR describes the poor performance of the agricultural sector in Africa. This casts serious doubts on the effectiveness of African NARS, which need to become more demand-driven, responsive and client-oriented (Chema et al., 2002). In an exhaustive inventory of the biotechnology sector in Africa, Mugabe (2002) notes that activities are ongoing in only a few countries: Countries using third-generation techniques: Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe; Countries using third-generation techniques but that have not yet developed products/processes: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda; Countries engaged in second-generation technology: Tanzania, Zambia. South Africa is leading biotechnology research and development in Africa; Zimbabwe has made significant efforts to define targets for its biotechnology sector. Mugabe´s proposed research agenda has rekindled NEPAD´s interest in biotechnology. In the biotechnology sector, programmes and national policies in some countries appear to be improving. Sub-Saharan Africa More than a decade ago, in a study for the African Academy of Science, Idachaba (1991) urged producer and consumer groups to support the NARS in sub-Saharan Africa. While welcoming the World Bank´s SPAAR programme, he noted that it should not focus exclusively on governments, but also on the private sector. Donor agencies are evidently suffering from aid fatigue in their home countries, so that other sources of funding also need to be tapped. Idachaba´s report may reflect the|$|R
