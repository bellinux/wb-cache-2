25|$|The 1990s saw the {{development}} of Earthships, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published {{in a series of}} 3 books by Mike Reynolds. The building material is tires filled with earth. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering).</b> Berms are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally black water is recycled again for more plant watering. The cisterns are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from solar power.|$|E

50|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} is {{the most}} commonly used structural material in <b>earth</b> <b>shelter</b> construction. It is strong and readily available. Untreated wood rots within five years of use in <b>earth</b> <b>shelter</b> construction. Steel can be used, but needs to be encased by concrete to keep it from direct contact with the soil which corrodes the metal. Bricks and CMUs (concrete masonry units) are also possible options in <b>earth</b> <b>shelter</b> construction but must be reinforced to keep them from shifting under vertical pressure unless the building is constructed with arches and vaults.|$|R

2500|$|This sod {{home was}} used by James Addison and his family [...] north of Kindersley, Saskatchewan, Canada and [...] east on Highway 21. [...] His {{property}} held a barn, two sheds, shelterbelt as well as dugout. Sod houses were a popular construction choice in the early 1900s by the early homesteaders to Saskatchewan. [...] Similar to an <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> type of houses. [...] Whereas many <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> houses were built into hills, a 'soddie' had the base dug down about [...] below the residence square footage area. [...] A layer of buffalo, oxen or cattle chips which was then covered over with a well packed layer of clay. [...] The walls were made of pieces of sod approximately [...] deep, [...] wide, and 4 to [...] long. [...] These sod pieces were laid in overlapping fashion to construct all four walls. These walls would provide shelter in its enclosed space from precipitation, wind, heat, and the cold of 40 degree below winters, and insulation against the heat of 40 degree above summers. [...] The roofs were generally made of aspen logs laid across the walls, and these logs covered in sod. [...] Heavy spring rains were the main downfall of these homes as the sod on the roof, dried out from winter, and only supported with the logs would wash away with the water. [...] Most homesteaders used the sod house as a temporary house until a wooden or brick structure was built.|$|E
2500|$|Skara Brae's {{people were}} makers and users of grooved ware, a {{distinctive}} style of pottery {{that appeared in}} northern Scotland not long before {{the establishment of the}} village. The houses used <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering,</b> being sunk into the ground. They were sunk into mounds of pre-existing prehistoric domestic waste known as middens. [...] The midden provided the houses with a stability and also acted as insulation against Orkney's harsh winter climate. On average, each house measures [...] in size with a large square room containing a stone hearth used for heating and cooking. Given the number of homes, it seems likely that no more than fifty people lived in Skara Brae at any given time.|$|E
2500|$|The fort's {{construction}} was improved under the German Empire, which renamed it Fort Goeben after a Prussian general who had distinguished {{himself at the}} Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870. Immediate German construction focused on dispersing gun batteries to flanking positions and reinforcing protection for personnel and ammunition against shellfire. In 1885, new explosives led to a massive increase in the explosive power of artillery projectiles, the so-called crise de l'obus-torpille ("torpedo-shell crisis). This development made unprotected artillery and masonry construction entirely obsolete, as the new shells could easily destroy masonry structures. [...] In response, concrete and <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> was employed in new forts, and older forts were reinforced under the new principles. In 1885 a program of reinforcement covered some critical areas of Queuleu with concrete and provided better infantry shelters. As an early fort, Queuleu has relatively few underground passages compared to the Moselstellung forts of the 1890s, but does feature countermine passages extending {{from the front of}} the fort.|$|E

50|$|Direct {{coupling}} or <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> {{occurs when}} a building uses earth as a buffer for the walls. The earth acts as a heat sink and can effectively mitigate temperature extremes. <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> improves the performance of building envelopes by reducing heat losses and also reduces heat gains by limiting infiltration.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> are numerous. They include: {{taking advantage of}} the earth as a thermal mass, offering extra protection from the natural elements, energy savings, providing substantial privacy, efficient use of land in urban settings, shelters have low maintenance requirements, and <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> commonly takes advantage of passive solar building design.|$|E

50|$|The site {{planning}} for an <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> building {{is an integral}} part of the overall design; investigating the landscape of a potential building site is crucial. There are many factors to assess when surveying a site for underground construction. The topography, regional climate, vegetation, water table and soil type of varying landscapes all play dynamic roles in the design and application of <b>earth</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} building, <b>earth</b> <b>shelters</b> {{require the}} insulation {{on the exterior}} of the building rather than inside the wall. One {{reason for this is that}} it provides protection for the waterproof membrane against freeze damage, another is that the <b>earth</b> <b>shelter</b> is able to better retain its desired temperature. There are two types of insulation used in <b>earth</b> <b>shelter</b> construction. The first is close-celled extruded polystyrene sheets. Two to three inches glued to the outside of the waterproofing is generally sufficient. The second type of insulation is a spray on foam. This works very well where the shape of the structure is unconventional, rounded or difficult to get to. Foam insulation requires an additional protective top coat such as foil to help it resist water penetration.|$|R

500|$|There {{are various}} configurations. At one extreme, an <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> {{dwelling}} is completely underground, with perhaps an open courtyard to provide air and light.|$|R

50|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> is the {{architectural}} practice of using earth against building walls for external thermal mass, to reduce heat loss, and to easily maintain a steady indoor air temperature. <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> has become relatively more popular in modern times, especially among environmentalists and advocates of passive solar and sustainable architecture. However, the practice {{has been around}} for nearly as long as humans have been constructing their own shelters.|$|E
50|$|Issues {{also include}} the {{sustainability}} of building materials. <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> often requires heavier construction than conventional building techniques, and many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs.|$|E
40|$|With rising {{energy prices}} {{and the threat of}} climate change, energy costs and energy savings have become a central and {{important}} part in building. Therefore it is interesting to explore different and non-conventional methods of energy conservation. Building <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> houses is such a method. Earth provides good insulation and provides the ability to both reduce the total heating needs and to reduce the maximum power demand. The aim {{of this study was to}} construct a house in Malmö and see if <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> houses can be a cost effective alternative for the construction of sustainable and energy-efficient houses. Previous studies have shown that <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> houses have reduced their power requirement with up to 25 % and their use of energy with 10 %. Numerical calculations in Comsol Multiphysic 4. 2, was performed on a house with different degrees of earth covering. Thereafter, additional investments because of the strengthened structure to accommodate the weight of the earth have been made. Subsequently, a number of economic calculations performed for various scenarios of future energy price were made. The study shows that it is profitable with <b>Earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> houses and that a 10 cm thick layer of earth on the roof is the optimal amount...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the environmental attributes to underground building shape and configuration, materials, structures, use, maintenance, lighting, occupancy, and management. These criteria are hypothesized {{to be of}} more influences on the building environment {{in the cases of}} underground spaces than in the aboveground. The aim is to approach and link together the many recent architectural and engineering factors that affect indoor environmental quality (IEQ) as a contribution to the affordability and sustainability of present <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> building design and development. To attain its goals, the study develops a conceptual micro-framework of healthy buildings' parameters and economic aspects for evaluating links between sustainable construction and outcomes of health, productivity, and affordability. The conclusion indicates the importance of integrating appropriate technologies into <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> space design, while the recommendations conform with environmental organizations and policies' directives in both their short and long-term development plans to provide affordable and healthy <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> interiors...|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the region}} and site {{selected}} for <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> construction, the benefits and objectives of the <b>earth</b> <b>shelter</b> construction vary. For cool and temperate climates, objectives consist of retaining winter heat, avoiding infiltration, receiving winter sun, using thermal mass, shading and ventilating during the summer, and avoiding winter winds and cold pockets. For hot, arid climates objectives include maximizing humidity, providing summer shade, maximizing summer air movement, and retaining winter heat. For hot, humid climates objectives include avoiding summer humidity, providing summer ventilation, and retaining winter heat.|$|R
50|$|In {{buildings}} using <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering,</b> {{a potential}} problem is too much humidity, so waterproofing is critical. Water seepage can lead to mold growth, causing significant damage and air quality issues. Properly waterproofing foundation walls is required to prevent deterioration and seepage.|$|E
50|$|Passive solar {{technologies}} include {{direct and}} indirect solar gain for space heating, solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon, use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings, solar cookers, the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation, and <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering.</b>|$|E
50|$|Earth, mud and sod: dirt's heat {{capacity}} {{depends on its}} density, moisture content, particle shape, temperature, and composition. Early settlers to Nebraska built houses with thick walls made of dirt and sod because wood, stone, and other building materials were scarce. The extreme thickness of the walls provided some insulation, but mainly served as thermal mass, absorbing thermal energy {{during the day and}} releasing it during the night. Nowadays, people sometimes use <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering</b> around their homes for the same effect. In <b>earth</b> <b>sheltering,</b> the thermal mass comes not only from the walls of the building, but from the surrounding earth that is in physical contact with the building. This provides a fairly constant, moderating temperature that reduces heat flow through the adjacent wall.|$|E
50|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> {{homes are}} often {{constructed}} with energy conservation and savings in mind. Specific designs of <b>earth</b> <b>shelters</b> allow for maximum savings. For bermed or in-hill construction, a common {{plan is to}} place all the living spaces {{on the side of}} the house facing the equator. This provides maximum solar radiation to bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchen spaces. Rooms that do not require natural daylight and extensive heating such as the bathroom, storage and utility room are typically located on the opposite (or in hill) side of the shelter. This type of layout can also be transposed to a double level house design with both levels completely underground. This plan has the highest energy efficiency of <b>earth</b> <b>sheltered</b> homes because of the compact configuration as well as the structure being submerged deeper in the earth. This provides it with a greater ratio of earth cover to exposed wall than a one story shelter would.|$|R
