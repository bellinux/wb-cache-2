Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>of</b> their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

25|$|Hillel {{lived in}} Jerusalem {{during the time}} of King Herod and the Roman emperor Augustus. In the Midrash {{compilation}} Sifre (Deut. 357), the periods of Hillel's life are made parallel to those in the life of Moses. Both lived 120 years (Deut. 34:7), and at the age of forty Hillel went to the Land of Israel; forty years he spent in study; and the last third of his life he was the spiritual head of the Jewish people. A biographical sketch can be constructed; that Hillel went to Jerusalem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>of</b> his life and attained a great age. His activity of forty years likely covered the period of 30 BCE to 10 CE.|$|E
25|$|The poem is {{seventeen}} lines long. It {{is divided}} into two sections which are easily distinguishable from each other; lines 1-14 are a simple description of the horrors of the landscape of battle, while lines 15-17 are a declaration of the meaninglessness of the sacrifice that war requires. The theme of premature death is built into the structure of the poem itself, as lines 1-11 have four stresses, lines 12 through 15 has five or six stresses. This climaxes in line 16, which is the longest in the poem at 17 syllables, and is immediately followed by the shortest line in the poem, at 7 syllables. The abrupt shortening from line 16 to 17 is suggestive of the abrupt death of young men who were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>of</b> life and who had so much potential left.|$|E

Immediately after Coke's death, a committee formed to create a monument to him; over a thousand subscribers contributed £5,000.
