To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> sea of positive charge; this was the plum pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
5|$|In {{those areas}} which the Red Army had {{captured}} {{and before the}} fighting in {{the centre of the}} city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport {{in and out of the}} city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head each city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> including firemen and railwaymen.|$|E

40|$|As {{is known}} the {{repulsion}} {{of the volume}} elements of an uniformly accelerating charge or <b>a</b> charge supported <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uniform</b> gravitational field accounts for the electromagnetic contribution to the charge’s inertial and gravitational mass, respectively. This means that the mutual repulsion of the volume elements of the charge produces the resistance to its accelerated motion. Conversely, the effect of electromagnetic attraction of opposite charges enhances the accelerated motion of the charges provided {{that they have been}} initially uniformly accelerated or supported <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uniform</b> gravitational field. The significance of this effect is that it constitutes a possibility of altering inertia and gravitation...|$|R

5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} {{the only person in the}} room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> manner impossible. An {{example of this}} could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name {{for one of the}} rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America on December 9, 2008. Releases include a one-disc edition DVD; a two-disc Special Edition DVD; a two-disc edition BD; and a Special Edition BD package featuring a statuette of the Bat-pod. The BD/iTunes version presents the film in a variable aspect ratio, with the IMAX sequences framed in 1.78:1, while scenes filmed in 35mm are framed in 2.40:1. The DVD versions feature the entire film framed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Disc 2 of the two-disc Special Edition DVD features the six main IMAX sequences in the original 1.44:1 aspect ratio. Additional IMAX shots throughout the film that are presented in 1.78:1 on the Blu-ray release are not, however, included in the DVD's special features. In addition to the standard DVD releases, some stores released their own exclusive editions of the film.|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

40|$|We study {{sequential}} and single-round uniform-price auctions with affiliated values. We derive symmetric equilibrium for {{the auction}} in which k 1 objects {{are sold in}} the first round and k 2 in the second round, with and without revelation of the first-round winning bids. We demonstrate that auctioning objects <b>in</b> sequence generates <b>a</b> lowballing effect that reduces first-round revenue. Thus, revenue is greater <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single-round, <b>uniform</b> auction for k = k 1 + k 2 objects than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequential <b>uniform</b> auction with no bid announcement. When the first-round winning bids are announced, we also identify two informational effects: a positive effect on second-round price and an ambiguous effect on first-round price. The expected first-round price can be greater or smaller than with no bid announcement, and greater or smaller than the expected price <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single-round <b>uniform</b> auction. <b>As</b> a result, total expected revenue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequential <b>uniform</b> auction with winning-bids announcement can be greater or smaller than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single-round <b>uniform</b> auction.
