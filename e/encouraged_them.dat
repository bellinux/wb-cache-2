5|$|Edward's father, {{though a}} harsh disciplinarian, was demonstrably affectionate, {{and his mother}} {{displayed}} a frolicsome side with her children that belied her austere public image.

5|$|In January 1995, Selena headlined the Teach the Children {{festival in}} San Antonio. The concert funded a {{non-profit}} program to provide school supplies to needy children. Selena was {{a spokesperson for}} women in abusive relationships. She also helped out at homeless shelters. According to the A television series Biography, Selena's fans were often minorities; she <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> {{to make the most}} of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to {{register to vote}} annually, as mandated by the Act. Press coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves {{as part of a}} national political movement during the 1830s.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Baden-Powell {{intended}} {{that the}} scheme {{would be used}} by established organizations, in particular the Boys' Brigade, from the founder William A. Smith. However, because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden-Powell with requests for assistance. He <b>encouraged</b> <b>them,</b> and the Scouting movement developed momentum. In 1910 Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom. As the movement grew, Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, and other specialized units {{were added to the}} program.|$|E
5|$|Blyton {{felt she}} had a {{responsibility}} to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them {{to raise funds for}} animal and paediatric charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Double {{standards}} between genders {{and classes}} are exposed throughout the novella. Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' {{relations with the}} suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution. Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to continue after some were raped.|$|E
5|$|Hill was {{a moving}} {{force behind the}} {{development}} of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice {{with the aid of}} his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.|$|E

5|$|Official {{religion}} {{involved a}} variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were performed every day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These offerings, in addition to maintaining maat for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving generosity and <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to remain benevolent rather than vengeful.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1903, {{a simple}} wooden cross commemorated the battle site, {{located on the}} {{so-called}} Buchbuhl, a hill overlooking the village, and the plains to the southeast, {{where much of the}} fighting occurred. In 1903, a monument was erected to honor the battle. In 1945, when French troops arrived in the region, they closed the monument; the local pastor <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to reopen it, calling it a chapel.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{newspaper}} lacked the necessary 25,000 lire to sponsor the race, the organizers consulted Primo Bongrani, a sympathetic accountant {{at the bank}} Cassa di Risparmio. He proceeded to solicit donations from all over Italy, and succeeded in raising sufficient money to cover the operating costs. The prize money came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta employee, <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> {{to contribute to the}} race. Even Corriere, La Gazzettas rival, donated 3,000 lire.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War was ongoing during Robinson's administration. During Robinson's tenure, the Confederacy {{made its}} major advance into the Commonwealth. In {{an attempt to}} protect the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth, Robinson raised taxes in an effort to revive Kentucky's state militia. He was also concerned with the effect the war had on public education in the state. He asked the General Assembly to investigate the condition of state schools, especially in war-ravaged areas, and <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to accept the Lincoln administration's offer of land to establish an agricultural and mechanical college.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{original}} repertoire {{consisted of}} {{rhythm and blues}} covers, but after Zappa joined the band he <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers. The musical content of Freak Out! ranges from rhythm and blues, doo-wop and standard blues-influenced rock to orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The first Spanish {{contact with}} the Manche Ch'ol was in 1525, when an {{expedition}} led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s crossed their territory. From the early 17th century onwards, Dominican friars attempted their concentration into mission towns and their conversion to Christianity. These attempts alarmed their warlike Itza neighbours to the northwest, who attacked the mission towns and fomented rebellion among the Manche. The Manche Ch'ol in the mission towns were badly affected by disease, which also <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to flee the towns.|$|E
5|$|The new {{island was}} named after the fire jÃ¶tunn Surtur from Norse mythology (Surts is the genitive case of Surtur, plus , island). Three French journalists {{representing}} the magazine Paris Match notably landed there on 6 December 1963, staying for about 15minutes before violent explosions <b>encouraged</b> <b>them</b> to leave. The journalists jokingly claimed French sovereignty over the island, but Iceland quickly asserted that the new island belonged to it.|$|E

On 30 November, a Declaration of Unity was signed between Flanders and the Brabant states.
