5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops {{would improve the}} line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

5|$|By 7:00a.m. Central Daylight Time, CAPE values began {{exceeding}} 4,000 j/kg, a {{level that}} climatologically favors the development of severe thunderstorms. Despite conflicting model data on the specified area where thunderstorms would develop, the newly available information that denoted a more favorable severe thunderstorm setup <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state prompted the SPC to upgrade the forecasted threat of severe weather to a moderate risk for south-central Kansas, much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma, and the northwestern and north-central portions Texas at 11:15a.m. CDT that morning, which now indicated an elevated threat of strong tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the adult}} Guianan cock-of-the-rock {{consists}} mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous. Up to 65 species of fruit {{have been reported in}} their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit. In the British Guiana, Thomas E. Gilliard found papayas growing {{at the base of a}} huge rock. On top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting.|$|E
5|$|The main rock {{formations}} {{in the area}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. These formations are all primarily made of sandstone, but also contain conglomerate, shale, and siltstone. They were formed during the Devonian, Mississippian and Devonian, and the Mississippian, respectively. The Catskill Formation is mostly found in the lower and middle reaches of the watershed, along the creek and its tributaries. The Huntley Mountain Formation is found in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed and on some of the streams <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed.

5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on {{details of the}} handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they all agree that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his work <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed {{as a result of the}} English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E
5|$|Geralee Vega Morales participated on Puerto Rico's behalf as {{its only}} weightlifter. Born in 1986, Vega was 22 {{at the time}} of her {{participation}} in Beijing. She took part in the women's lightweight event, which includes athletes under 58kilograms in weight. She had not previously participated in any Olympic games. Vega's event took place on August 11, and included 12 athletes in total. During the snatch phase of the event, Vega was given three attempts. She unsuccessfully attempted to lift 90kilograms of weight during her first two attempts, but succeeded on her third, tying eighth <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. She then attempted 112kilograms during the clean and jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting it on her first attempt. She did not succeed in lifting 115kilograms on her second attempt, or 116kilograms on her third. Overall, the combination of her highest scores in snatch (90) and clean and jerk (112) yielded a score of 202 points. Geralee Vega Morales ranked ninth in the event, ahead of Poland's Marieta Gotfryd (200 points) and behind Romania's Roxana Cocos (204 points).

5|$|The initial VC attack {{had split}} allied {{formations}} within the garrison; the 1st and 2nd Platoons of the 11th MSF Company were {{pushed away from}} the eastern perimeter, while the Marines were either alone or had organized themselves into small groups of two or three, but none were in contact with each another. Meanwhile, from inside his command post, White called in air-support which later {{came in the form of}} an AC-47 Spooky gunship, a modified version of the C-47 Skytrain equipped with 7.62mm General Electric miniguns for the support of ground troops. On the eastern side of the garrison, VC soldiers of the 40th Battalion continued to charge up the hill firing their AK-47 assault rifles. Simultaneously, other elements of the VC 1st Regiment probed the southern and western end of the garrison, now held by Captain White's 1st and 3rd Platoons, to test the strength of allied defenses <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garrison. By that stage, however, most Nung soldiers had retreated from their positions on the eastern end of the garrison, while the U.S. Marines were pinned down around the perimeters. By 03:30, the VC had captured the Marines' gun position. Captain White was able to maintain contact with Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas through telephone, but they could not coordinate their forces.|$|E
