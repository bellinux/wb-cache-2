5|$|The {{stabilization}} policy brought about after Khrushchev's removal established a ruling <b>gerontocracy,</b> and political corruption became a normal phenomenon. Brezhnev, however, never initiated any large-scale anti-corruption campaigns.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a <b>gerontocracy,</b> a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} simple model of fiscal {{competition}} among ageing municipalities. When ageing advances, <b>gerontocracies</b> and social planners gradually substitute publicly provided goods {{aimed at the}} mobile young population for publicly provided goods for the elderly. This substitution process does not only depend on the ageing itself but also on crowding effects and on the regional distribution of the elderly population. We show that fiscal competition prevents the exploitation of the young. When {{the share of the}} elderly is sufficiently large, the utility of the young is even higher in <b>gerontocracies</b> than in welfare maximizing societies. Due to fiscal competition, the <b>gerontocracies</b> will provide even more of the publicly provided good for the young than the social planner.

50|$|Kobolds have {{specialized}} laborers, yet {{the majority}} of kobolds are miners. The most coveted careers are trapmaker, sorcerer, caretaker, and warrior. Kobolds typically apprentice in their chosen profession {{at the age of}} three. A kobold's job may change over the years based on the needs of the tribe. Kobold tribes are <b>gerontocracies,</b> ruled by their eldest member, who is known as the All-Watcher. Often this leader is a powerful sorcerer. Kobold laws may change along with their leaders. Kobolds prefer exile to execution, and in some disputes, kobolds tribes will split in order to spread their kind over a larger region. Kobolds often lay eggs in a common nest, with specialized foster parents to watch over the eggs and wyrmlings (young under one year).|$|R
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis {{is a comprehensive}} analysis {{of the influence of}} changes in the population structure on local communities, in particular with respect to the provision of publicly provided goods. The focus is placed on the consequences of two of the major processes of demographic change, namely aging and shrinking. The three main chapters of this contribution consider the effects at the local level from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The first model focuses on the influence of population aging on the provision of local publicly provided goods, when the young population may relocate. When aging advances, <b>gerontocracies</b> and social planners substitute publicly provided goods aimed at the mobile young for publicly provided goods for the elderly. However, due to fiscal competition, <b>gerontocracies</b> will provide even more of the publicly provided good for the young than the social planner. The second model considers in a two-period setting, the interaction of a shrinking population when the investments made by the previous generation are long lived. The laissez-faire and welfare maximizing outcomes are computed for two cases; first with no costs of upkeep and second for the case when costs of upkeep accrue. A comparison of the solutions shows that public provision for the first generation is inefficiently low in laissez-faire when there are no costs of upkeep. However, if costs of upkeep accrue, the laissez-faire outcome for the intergenerational publicly provided good may be too high. Chapter four contains an empirical analysis. In a two-stage analysis the efficiency of the provision of child care services in municipalities is evaluated in the German State of Saxony. First, the results of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) show substantial efficiency differences; the median municipality is up to 28 % inefficient. In a second stage bootstrapped truncated regression, determinants of the inefficiency are identified. Explanatory variables such as an uncompensated mayor or a larger share of over 65 -year-olds significantly increase inefficiency...|$|R
5|$|Lê Duẩn's {{report to}} the 5th National Congress was a biting self-criticism of his {{leadership}} and the party's management. He criticised political and economic corruption and the <b>gerontocracy</b> itself. The 5th Central Committee contained only one member under 60. During this period the Central Committee was disrupted by factional infighting between pragmatists and conservatives. This struggle would lead to economic reform. Lê Duẩn and his supporters began the effort to open the economy.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack {{as the key}} to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a <b>gerontocracy</b> (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 5th National Congress, the party {{leadership}} had turned into a veritable <b>gerontocracy.</b> The five most powerful Politburo members were all over the age of 70; Lê Duẩn was 74, Trường Chinh was 75, Phạm Văn Đồng was 76, Phạm Hùng was 70 and Lê Đức Thọ was 72. Lê Duẩn {{is believed to have been}} in bad health during this period; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several occasions for medical treatment during the late-1970s and early 1980s. It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{polygyny}} is {{more widespread}} in Africa {{than in any}} other continent. Some scholars see the slave trade's impact on the male-to-female sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa. Generally in rural areas with growing populations, the higher the incidence of polygyny, the greater the delay of first marriage for young men. The higher the average polygyny rate, the greater the element of <b>gerontocracy</b> and social stratification.|$|E
500|$|Young politicians, such as Fyodor Kulakov and Grigory Romanov, {{were seen}} as {{potential}} successors to Brezhnev, {{but none of them}} came close. For example, Kulakov, one of the youngest members in the Politburo, was ranked seventh in the prestige order voted by the Supreme Soviet, far behind such notables as Kosygin, Podgorny, Suslov, and Kirilenko. As Edwin Bacon and Mark Sandle note in their book, Brezhnev Reconsidered, the Soviet leadership at Brezhnev's deathbed had evolved into [...] "a <b>gerontocracy</b> increasingly lacking of physical and intellectual vigour".|$|E
500|$|When Leonid Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 Yuri Andropov {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the committee in charge of managing his funeral. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviet citizens. First World commentators saw this as proof that Andropov would become Brezhnev's successor as general secretary. The political corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure had become a major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the Soviet economy would possibly recover if the Soviet Government was able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev's regime was also criticised for ideological laxness and self-indulgence. [...] The <b>gerontocracy</b> established by Brezhnev was slowly phased out by Andropov, and new recruits were appointed to the Party [...] "centre", such as future Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Chief Ideologue Yegor Ligachev. Soviet foreign policy had also gone awry during Brezhnev's last years, and by June 1982, just before his death, Ronald Reagan classified the Soviet Union as an [...] "Evil Empire". This hardline diplomatic stance did not wither away before Mikhail Gorbachev initiated the [...] "New Thinking". Support for Marxism–Leninism continued to be evident amongst the Soviet people, however, its base of support slowly withered during the Brezhnev Era. The Soviet people still remained wary of such concepts as liberal democracy and multi-party systems, and because of it, Marxism–Leninism remained the leading belief in the country. Due to the large military buildup of the 1960s the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower during Brezhnev's rule.|$|E
500|$|Khrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions: in 1956 and 1962. His {{policy of}} de-Stalinisation earned him many enemies within the party, {{especially}} from old Stalinist appointees. Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising. A {{group known as}} Anti-Party Group tried, but failed, to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957. As Khrushchev grew older, his erratic behavior became worse, usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo. Leonid Brezhnev, a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev's removal from power; Alexei Kosygin became the new Premier and Anastas Mikoyan kept his office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. In 1965, on the orders of the Politburo, Mikoyan was forced to retire; Nikolai Podgorny took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium. The USSR in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a collective leadership. Henry A. Kissinger, the American National Security Advisor, mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the 'Leader of the Soviet Union {{and that he was}} at the helm of 'Soviet foreign policy' because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference. The [...] "Era of Stagnation", a derogatory term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, was a period marked by low socio-economic efficiency in the country and a <b>gerontocracy</b> ruling the country. Yuri Andropov succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982. He was 68 years old at the time. In 1983 Andropov was hospitalised, and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health; Nikolai Tikhonov usually chaired the meetings in his place. Following Andropov's death 15 months after his appointment, an even older leader, 72 year old Konstantin Chernenko was elected to the General Secretariat. His rule lasted for {{little more than a year}} until his death 13 months later on 10 March 1985.|$|E
500|$|The {{author of}} The Soviet Paradox: External Expansion, Internal Decline Seweryn Bialer {{has a more}} mixed {{assessment}} of Brezhnev's reign. Bialer notes that the era {{was a time of}} [...] "lost opportunities", but admits that the economic growth during Brezhnev's first years weakened [...] "the rationale for radical reform". However, as Bialer notes in his book, even the <b>gerontocracy</b> which Brezhnev himself had created were disillusioned with Brezhnev's leadership when he died in 1982. In his book Russia's Transformation: Snapshots of a Crumbling System Robert Vincent Daniels argues that Brezhnev [...] "gave the country stability, if nothing else, even though it was the stability of the police state", and that his domestic and external policies tried to ensure the [...] "status quo". Daniels believes that Brezhnev's reign can be separated into two parts, the first, starting in 1964 and ending in 1975 conforms to a [...] "status quo leadership, building the economy, pursuing détente, and maintaining political equilibrium at home". The second phase, which began in 1975, was exactly the opposite; the economy stopped growing, the collective leadership ended with Nikolai Podgorny's removal, Brezhnev developed a cult of personality and the Soviet Union itself started to stagnate. Historians Jiří Valenta and Frank Cibulka noted in their book Gorbachev's New Thinking and Third World Conflicts that Brezhnev's legacy was a [...] "mixture of achievements and failures in both domestic and foreign policy". However, they argue that by {{the time of his death}} his failures had become severe chronic systematic problems. Brezhnev's main achievements, according to Valenta and Cibulka, was his foreign and defence policies, however, with the economy in decline these achievements were not durable in the long-run. They also note that the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower, which in turn increased their influence in non-communist Third World countries.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Lebed {{was born}} in the Cossack town of Novocherkassk, in the Rostov Oblast, in 1950. In his youth he was not a bad student but {{preferred}} boxing and chess. He grew up in poverty, the son of a carpenter who spent several years in a Stalin era labor camp, and witnessed the Novocherkassk massacre in 1962. During that time he worked at a factory. He was determined to become a paratrooper and joined the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in 1969, becoming a cadet platoon and company commander while he was there. In 1982, as an officer of the Soviet Airborne Troops, Lebed became a battalion commander in Afghanistan during the Soviet war there. During his time in Afghanistan, Lebed became popular with the troops under his command. He held this position until 1982 at which point he attended the Frunze Military Academy. Among his duties was {{being a member of the}} funeral department during the period of many deaths among the Soviet <b>gerontocracy,</b> including three Soviet rulers.|$|E
50|$|The Urhobos are {{currently}} organized as political kingdoms, <b>gerontocracy</b> and plutocracies. <b>Gerontocracy</b> {{is the government}} by elders based on the age grade-system in the community while plutocracies is government by the rich and wealthy, an evolutionary state but retaining the elements of <b>gerontocracy.</b> Although {{it is not clear}} which kingship is older among the kingdoms, these kingship developments reached their climax in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gerontocracy</b> {{generally}} {{occurs as}} a {{phase in the}} development of an entity, rather than being part of it throughout its existence.

5000|$|A <b>gerontocracy</b> {{is a form}} of oligarchical rule {{in which}} an entity is ruled by leaders who are {{significantly}} older than most of the adult population. The ancient Greeks {{were among the first to}} believe in this idea of gerontocracies, as famously stated by Plato, [...] "it is for the elder man to rule and for the younger to submit". However, these beliefs are not unique to ancient Greece, as many cultures still subscribe to this way of thinking. Often these political structures are such that political power within the ruling class accumulates with age, making the oldest the holders of the most power. Those holding the most power may not be in formal leadership positions, but often dominate those who are. In a simplified definition, a <b>gerontocracy</b> is a society where leadership is reserved for elders. The best example of this can be seen in the ancient Greek city state of Sparta, which was ruled by a Gerousia. A Gerousia was a council made up of members who were at least 60 years old and served for life.|$|E
