5000|$|The {{concept of}} an {{underwater}} glider was first explored in the early 1960s with a prototype swimmer delivery vehicle named Concept Whisper. [...] The sawtooth glide pattern, stealth properties {{and the idea of}} a buoyancy engine powered by the swimmer-passenger was described by Ewan Fallon in his <b>Hydroglider</b> patent submitted in 1960. [...] In 1992, the University of Tokyo conducted tests on ALBAC, a drop weight glider with no buoyancy control and only one glide cycle. [...] The DARPA SBIR program received a proposal for a temperature gradient glider in 1988. DARPA was aware at that time of similar research projects underway in the USSR.This idea, a glider with a buoyancy engine powered by a heat exchanger, was introduced to the oceanographic community by Henry Stommel in a 1989 article in Oceanography, when he proposed a glider concept called Slocum, developed with research engineer Doug Webb. They named the glider after Joshua Slocum, who made the first solo circumnavigation of the globe by sailboat. They proposed harnessing energy from the thermal gradient between deep ocean water (2-4 Â°C) and surface water (near atmospheric temperature) to achieve globe-circling range, constrained only by battery power on board for communications, sensors, and navigational computers.|$|E
