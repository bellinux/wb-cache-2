Major modifications of protein structure {{have been put}} forward to explain such functionality improvement. But as for lysozyme, one of the egg white proteins, <b>dry-heating</b> results in a great increase of foaming properties, without any significant modifications of structure, as determined thanks to usual analytical methods for secondary and tertiary structure determination. On the other hand, chemical modifications of the protein sequence could be highlighted for about 40 % of lysozyme molecules: up to 5 Asp/Asn residues were changed for succinimide residues after <b>dry-heating</b> for 7 days at 80 °C. These modifications result in more tensioactive forms, compared to native lysozyme. However, these "succinimide lysozymes" do not explain all the interfacial properties of <b>dry-heated</b> lysozyme.

The degree of conformational changes induced in the egg white proteins by <b>dry-heating</b> was strongly dependent on the amount of water present. Preferentially, <b>dry-heating</b> at 80 degrees C should be performed on egg white powder with a moisture content below 6. 8 %, as the loss of protein solubility above this value is extensive. In addition to insoluble aggregates, soluble, strongly stabilized aggregates were also formed, especially at higher moisture contents. The decrease in denaturation enthalpy, increase in surface hydrophobicity, and exposure of SH groups previously hidden in the protein core and their subsequent oxidation were more pronounced at prolonged <b>dry-heating</b> times and at higher moisture contents.

40|$|Antimicrobial drug {{resistance}} causes public health problems worldwide. Scientific {{research for the}} discovery ofnovel antimicrobial molecules is thus highly stimulated [1]. Particular attention is given to antimicrobialmolecules that limit {{drug resistance}} development and have a large spectrum. Antimicrobial peptides and proteinsare thus good candidates. Some of them act on the bacterial cell wall because of their physico-chemicalproperties; when amphiphilic and positively charged, these molecules are able {{to interact with the}} negativelycharged bacterial surface[2]. These antimicrobial peptides and proteins can thus perturb the bacterial cellenvelope, enter the cell, and/or act on intracellular targets [2, 3]. Hen egg white lysozyme is a marketed protein,available at an affordable price (100 €/kg). This small protein (14. 4 kDa) is largely studied and widely known forits muramidase activity against the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria, the Gram negative bacteria beingprotected by their outer membrane [4]. However, lysozyme is also described as being active against some Gram-negative bacteria, especially becauseit permeabilizes the bacterial membranes [4, 5]. But few is known aboutthis activity, and the consequences on the bacterial membranes remains quite limited. Since <b>dry-heated</b> lysozyme, composed of a mixture of several isoforms, i. e. iso-aspartyle, native-like and succinimide lysozymes [6], is more positively charged, more hydrophobic and more tensio-active than native lysozyme [6], <b>dry-heating</b> could be away to increase lysozyme activity against the bacterial membranes, and especially against am-negative bacteria. To investigate the membrane activity of both native and <b>dry-heated</b> lysozyme, membrane permeability measurements using a mutant E. coli ML- 35 p and measurements of membrane potential perturbation were performed. These experiments revealed that native and <b>dry-heated</b> lysozyme induce different consequences on the bacterial membranes. Native lysozyme permeabilizes both outer and inner membranes. Pore formation could be observed for the outer membrane, but not for the inner membrane. Moreover, the membrane potential of the inner membrane is modified in the presence of native lysozyme. <b>Dry-heated</b> lysozyme induces an overall stronger disturbance than native lysozyme, by giving rise to the formation of more and/or larger pores in the outer membrane, by permeabilizing more rapidly the inne r membrane, and by leading to a stronger disturbance of membrane potential. We could also establish that each of the <b>dry-heated</b> lysozyme isoforms affords a specific disturbance of either the outer or the inner membrane. Succinimide lysozyme strongly increases the outer membrane permeability, but mildly modifies the permeability of the inner membrane. On the contrary, iso-aspartyle lysozyme modifies more strongly the inner than the outer membrane permeability. This was confirmed by membrane potential perturbation caused by iso-aspartylelysozyme.

This was thus investigated using an E. coli lipopolysaccharide monolayer (LPSM) membranemodel, mimicking the outer leaflet of the bacterial outer membrane. The interactions betweenlysozyme and LPSM were studied by tensiometry, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy(AFM) and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). Both N-L and DH-L are able to insert into aLPSM.
