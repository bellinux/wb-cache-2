40|$|In {{developing}} countries, including India, diarrhoea is {{a leading}} killer throughout the age pyramid. However, most of the medical literature on the determinants of diarrhoea focuses only on young children or the elderly, with health policy mainly targeting the former. Thus, the present article attempts {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the determinants of diarrhoea in adolescents - the understudied population. The paper develops a model using the medical literature, refines it to fit an Indian village context and tests the hypotheses identified through administering a questionnaire to 114 adolescents in an Indian village school. Results confirm the well known importance of household sanitation. In addition, the contribution of the present study is to assert that access to school <b>toilets</b> and usage <b>of</b> school <b>toilets</b> are also crucial. Furthermore, usage <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> at school varies as a function of gender and the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> a <b>toilet</b> in the studentâ€™s household. Finally, the installation <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> in schools is not enough, sustainable financial models must be found to maintain toilets and induce students to use them. ...|$|R

IR coaches have toilet {{system that has}} hole on the floor through which human feces and urine is flushed directly on railway tracks. Various types of environment friendly Green toilets have put on outfields trials by Indian Railways to overcome this problem. Controlled <b>Discharge</b> <b>Toilet</b> System (CDTS), Bio-toilet developed by Indian Railways engineers and DRDO biotechnologists, development <b>of</b> Zero <b>Discharge</b> <b>Toilet</b> System (ZDTS) by IIT Kanpur and Research Development and Standards Organization (RDSO) Lucknow, are some efforts in this direction. These technologies are more expensive due to inherent complexities, disposal problem at yards (ZDTS) and requirement of extra infrastructure at the terminal.

40|$|AbstractLiving in a {{high density}} urban kampung with limited space and {{resources}} has created a challenge on how {{to meet the demand}} of services for basic everyday activities within the available space. Various collective spatial systems in urban kampung represent some important strategies of the communities in dealing with their limited situation. This paper addresses the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> communal <b>toilet</b> system in urban kampung, as a collective spatial system developed by the community. The study identifies various spatial strategies incorporated within the communal toilet system, as well as social structures embedded within the spatial practice. The understanding of spatial and social system in the communal toilet system might provide some insights for the development of spatial strategies that are appropriate for urban kampung communities...|$|R

A concrete slab has been constructed for that purpose mainly for the frequency range above 125 Hz. In this way the equivalent force of different aspects of the use <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> has been determined: the use, the flushing and the filling of the reservoir. Also the effect of the mounting <b>of</b> the <b>toilet</b> on the concrete slab has been investigated.
