25|$|In {{terms of}} {{artificial}} intelligence the articulatory {{model can be}} called plant (i.e. the system, which {{is controlled by the}} brain); it represents a part of the embodiement of the neuronal speech processing system. The articulatory model generates sensory output which is the basis for generating <b>feedback</b> <b>information</b> for the DIVA model (see below: feedback control).|$|E
25|$|The {{resilience}} {{to severe}} channel conditions {{can be further}} enhanced if information about the channel is sent over a return-channel. Based on this <b>feedback</b> <b>information,</b> adaptive modulation, channel coding and power allocation may be applied across all sub-carriers, or individually to each sub-carrier. In the latter case, if a particular range of frequencies suffers from interference or attenuation, the carriers within that range can be disabled or made to run slower by applying more robust modulation or error coding to those sub-carriers.|$|E

25|$|Articulatory and {{acoustic}} feedback signals {{are used for}} generating somatosensory and auditory <b>feedback</b> <b>information</b> via the sensory preprocessing modules, which is forwarded towards the auditory and somatosensory map. At {{the level of the}} sensory-phonetic processing modules, auditory and somatosensory information is stored in short-term memory and the external sensory signal (ES, Fig. 5, which are activated via the sensory feedback loop) can be compared with the already trained sensory signals (TS, Fig. 5, which are activated via the phonetic map). Auditory and somatosensory error signals can be generated if external and intended (trained) sensory signals are noticeably different (cf. DIVA model).|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the <b>feedback</b> <b>information</b> to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
25|$|For speech production, the ACT model {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In {{the case of a}} frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs {{at the level of the}} phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory <b>feedback</b> <b>information</b> for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. Motoneuron activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently movement patterns of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study were to {{investigate}} the effects of a procedure to raise one 2 ̆ 7 s perceived self-efficacy and to examine the influence of the fluctuation of perceived self-efficacy upon the following behavioral changes. Ten subjects, 20 : 09 - 28 : 01 years old, were randomly assigned to the self-efficacy manipulating condition (experimental condition) with false biofeedback or control condition. In the experimental condition, Ss were asked to increase their heart rate for a minutes per one trial. In the first ten trials, false HR feedback was given to Ss as the increasing sign of heart rate, independently of their real changes in heart rate. Ss were asked to evaluate their strength of perceived self-efficacy to the task before every trial, and then verbal persuasion was given by an experimenter after the tenth trial. In the last five trials, Ss were given no <b>feedback</b> <b>informations.</b> In the control condition, Ss were also asked to increase their heart rate, but with no <b>feedback</b> <b>informations</b> and no chance to estimate own strength of perceived self-efficacy till the tenth trial. The last five trials were as same as in the experimental condition. The main results were as follows: i) In the experimental condition, false feedback caused the significant increase of self-efficacy score after the tenth trial (see Fig. 2). ii) The experimental group showed significantly more increase in heart rate than Ss in the control condition, especially in the last five trials, which were followed by the increase of self-efficacy score (see Fig. 3). iii) The fluctuation of self-efficacy score caused the change of heart rate and self-efficacy was regarded as the proceeding factor to predict the following behavioral changes (see Fig. 4). These results suggests the importance of perceived self-efficacy as an intervening factor between the treatment and real behavioral changes.
