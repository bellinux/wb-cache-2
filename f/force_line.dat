Also, all the Ninja Force figures were designed with a [...] "real ninja move". Scarlett's spring-loaded right leg could be pushed back, then released, causing it to spring forward in a kicking motion.|$|E
2500|$|CinemaBlend {{said the}} A-wing {{received}} little attention after Return of the Jedi because no prominent characters pilot the craft. Kenner in 1985 released an A-wing pilot figure {{as part of}} its Power of the <b>Force</b> <b>line,</b> and it released a [...] "magnificent" [...] A-wing toy as part of the [...] line. Since then, the A-wing has been recreated as various other toys, models, and collectibles by companies that include Galoob, Hasbro, Model Products Corporation, Estes Industries, Lego, and Fantasy Flight Games.|$|E

2500|$|In Europe, the 1982 mold of Scarlett was re-colored blonde, with a {{dark green}} and black uniform, and {{released}} as [...] "Quarrel". This figure {{was part of the}} Action <b>Force</b> <b>line,</b> and came packaged with the Z-Force RAM Motorcycle (a G.I. Joe Rapid Fire Motorcycle that had been recolored green and black). In 1984, she was again re-painted and re-characterized with the second generation of Action Force, this time as [...] "Scarlett", and released with the third generation AF range. The range was discontinued in Europe in the late 1980s. The G.I. Joe Collectors Club later released an overstock of Quarrel figures, as a promotional give away at the 1992 G.I. Joe Convention.|$|E

40|$|Topological {{conditions}} {{on the surface of}} a turbulent body of highly conductive fluid under which escape of magnetic <b>force</b> <b>lines</b> would be impossible (Drobyshevski, Yuferev 1974) are studied with exact calculation of intermediate field configurations as a possible explanation of the decay of stellar magnetic fields via turbulent mixing. It is shown that upward escape of magnetic <b>force</b> <b>lines</b> in the regions between convective cells is possible through rapid reconnection of the <b>force</b> <b>lines</b> (studied as neutral point annihilation) such as occurs continually in rapidly evolving sunspot groups. It is concluded that there exists no topological barrier to the escape of magnetic flux from the sun or from the local galaxy...|$|R

The figure was repainted again and released as part of the Shadow Ninjas line in 1994. Slice was released in a two pack with the G.I. Joe criminal investigation officer, Sure-Fire.

Analogies between superconductors and moving metallic liquids A metallic liquid flowing in a channel produces electromagnetic fields likely a rotating superconductor which produces a weak magnetic field. Such similitude {{is as much}} closer as higher the fluid speed is. That {{is due to a}} higher transport of magnetic <b>force</b> <b>lines</b> concerning conductor liquids.
