Multi-stakeholder initiatives, private-public partnership, sub-contracting, political alliances, hybrid coalitions, multi-sectoral networks, pluralist co-governance, and indeed foreign policy by proxy are all considered. Bringing together the most advanced scholarship, the book examines trade, environment, development, security, and human rights with reference to both EU and global institutional settings such as the WTO, UN Climate Summits, FAO, IFAD, ICC, UNHRC, UNSC, and at the EU level the <b>DG</b> FISMA, <b>TRADE,</b> CLIMA, DEVCO, HOME and ECHO.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{distributed}} energy management method for interconnected operation of CHP-based MGs. An hour-ahead optimal scheduling model is built, and the objective function includes the operation cost of CHPs, DGs, DR and network tariff. Considering each MG is operated independently, the optimal scheduling problem is decentralized into n sub-problems {{in accordance with the}} number of the associated MGs. Moreover, a distributed iterative algorithm is proposed based on the subgradient method considering the dynamic search direction. From numerical simulations, we have shown that each MG can choose to curtail load, adjust generation of <b>DGs</b> or <b>trade</b> with other MGs with a comprehensive consideration of generation cost, trading price, load characteristic and DR cost, which eventually reduces operation costs and makes power utilization more flexible and more interactive. Compared with the related studies, we have also shown the advantageous features in the proposed method on modeling and algorithm performance.|$|R

To validate the proposed methodology several tests are carried out with a 34 bus distribution system, changing the number and size of the DG units. The contract prices calculated with this methodology represent an equilibrium between the profit maximization pursued by the DG owner and the minimization of payments procured by the distribution company. Consequently, it can be concluded that the proposed methodology provides efficient incentives for both agents, providing a solution in which the DG and the distribution company are mutually beneficial. Furthermore, the location of the DG units can also be considered in the model, so that not only the contract price but also the equilibrium location can be found...|$|R

50|$|The {{consequences}} {{of not being}} granted market economy status {{have a big impact}} on the investigation. For example, if China is accused of dumping widgets, the basic approach is to consider the price of widgets in China against the price of Chinese widgets in Europe. But China does not have market economy status, so Chinese domestic prices can not be used as the reference. Instead, the <b>DG</b> <b>Trade</b> must decide upon an analogue market: a market which does have market economy status, and which is similar enough to China. Brazil and Mexico have been used, but the United States is a popular analogue market. In this case, the price of widgets in the United States is regarded as the substitute for the price of widgets in China. This process of choosing an analogue market is subject to the influence of the complainant, which has led to some criticism that it is an inherent bias in the process.|$|E

Trade negotiations are driven by the <b>DG</b> <b>Trade</b> (at the moment by Pascal Lamy). The <b>DG</b> <b>Trade</b> got its mandate to negotiate from the external trade ministries council, then, when an agreement is obtained by <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> it has still to be approved unanimously by the same council. Why do the nations of Europe decide to give up their power to a supranational institution? Trade was thought as the easiest was to make progress toward durable peace and European integration. It's primarily a political driven process not an economic one, although the expected economic success was thought to be an argument in favour of integration. A contrario a failure would have been deadly for European integration. At the end of WWII the European divide between the West and the East make West German military defence the first front opposed to the Soviet Union (contrary to Japan in Asia). That's the reason why Germany was quickly associated actively with the allies to the defence of West Europe. France and Germany were de facto the two main European countries able to oppose Soviet Union on ground, naturally the US was the cornerstone of EU defence. Germany wanted to be forgiven for the Nazi's crimes and Franco-German reconciliation was a strategic necessity.

The MIRAGE model has been developed primarily to study trade policy scenario and has been intensively used to assess bilateral and multilateral agreements. As a global CGE, it provides a rich set of indicators for each region that allows measuring the impact of any policy changes. Such indicators include: changes in production, production factor uses, real wages, value added by sector, real GDP, real income, exports, imports, terms of trade. It can be used under different set of assumptions to be easily adaptable to the issue at stake (perfect and imperfect competition, dynamic or static approach, imperfection on labour markets, alternative macroeconomic closures).

40|$|The 2006 'Global Europe' {{communication}} {{represented an}} important {{shift in the}} European Union's (EU's) trade strategy, ending a previous 'moratorium' on new free trade agreements and leading the EU {{to embark on a}} series of trade negotiations with emerging economies. In this thesis I study the drivers of this on-going preferential trade agenda. This poses a puzzle for conventional understandings of EU trade policy. While EU Studies approaches have treated it as uniquely insulated, focusing instead on supposedly 'exceptional' institutional determinants of policy, the shift to 'Global Europe' occurred {{in the absence of any}} institutional change to EU trade governance. I therefore begin by situating the study of EU trade policy within the discipline of International Political Economy (IPE), focusing on the role played by lobbyists (especially from the services sector) within a wider systemic context. I also suggest that rationalist approaches are insufficient to explain 'Global Europe' as the Commission's Directorate General (DG) for Trade served the interests of upmarket exporters at the expense of defensive interests. Given a strong mobilisation of protectionists with access to policymakers this liberal policy outcome cannot be explained purely in terms of institutional insulation nor be simply 'read off' from the material interests of societal actors. In contrast, I develop a novel constructivist IPE framework. While policymakers internalised a neoliberal discourse on the desirability, but politically contingent nature of, trade liberalisation – explaining why <b>DG</b> <b>Trade</b> pursued the policies it did, heeding the arguments of certain lobbyists over others – they consciously used a more necessitarian discourse in their public pronouncements to legitimate their agenda of market-opening. This approach also allows me to explain the recent convergence of what are traditionally seen as two distinct arenas of trade policymaking: the EU's 'commercial' trade agenda and its 'developmental' agreements with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

The workshop concentrated on major aspects related to the existing non-tariff barriers in trade between the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the European Union (EU), and other CIS countries. The participants discussed the challenges related to the general non-tariff barriers that exist between the EU, the EAEU, and the CIS countries, as well as possible solutions, particularly in the context of recent economic and political developments. The workshop also discussed the relationship between the norms and principles of international trade law contained in the provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO); analyzed the legal framework of economic integration in various regions of the world; and reflected on the potential for eliminating unnecessary obstacles to trade, including by mutual recognition of conformity. The workshop was focused particularly on the potential effects of the implementation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTA) between the EU and Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. It also addressed the economic impacts of the currently applied mutual sanctions conflict” between the EU, the USA and some other Western nations on the one hand, and Russia on the other, their impacts on international trade, and on the potentials of long-term cooperation between the EU and the EAEU. The impacts on economies of other CIS countries, not directly involved, were also touched upon. Harmonization of legislation in the field of technical, as well as sanitary, phytosanitary, and veterinary regulations between the EAEU and other regions, primarily the EU, was addressed in detail. The discussion covered the harmonization of terminology and labeling; harmonization of national and regional standards with international standards; accreditation, product safety, training in the field of standardization and conformity assessment as well as trade facilitation. In order to foster interdisciplinary and international dialogue on the topic, the workshop brought together well-established scientists, policymakers, banks and companies representatives from around the world, including: Péter Balás, Deputy Director General, <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> European Commission; Igor Finogenov, Chairman of the Management Board, Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), Kazakhstan; Pavel Kabat, Director General and Chief Executive Officer, IIASA; Evgeny Vinokurov, Director, Centre for Integration Studies, Eurasian Development Bank; Paul de Lusignan, Leading Expert, Tariff and Non-Tariff Negotiations, Rules of Origin, <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> European Commission,, Stefanie Harter, Head, Liaison Office to the German Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Interior and Justice, German Agency for International Cooperation, Evgeny Hotulev, Director, Department of Macroeconomic Policy, Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), Oleg Noginskiy, Director, Ukrainian Association Suppliers of the Customs Union, Veronika Movchan, Director, Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting (IER), Alessandro Nicita, Officer-in-Charge, Trade Policy Research Section, Trade Analysis Branch, Division on International Trade, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), among many others, with a total of 41 participants. The workshop participants discussed possible ways how non-tariff barriers could be reduced and convergence of technical regulations to the mutual benefit of all parties involved could be achieved. In this context, they also analyzed the opportunities and risks of economic modernization of the East-European partnership countries, if they adapt to European technical regulations and sanitary requirements. Possibilities for providing a unified policy, removing bottlenecks and differences in the sphere of technical regulation in the EAEU countries, was examined; and the impacts of such policy on producers of goods and services in different regions with regard to ensuring their competitiveness were assessed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the {{international}} actorness of the European Parliament (EP) within the global governance of cultural industries, and in particular with its ability to promote the Convention on diversity of cultural expressions (CDCE) on its international relations and on the EU international agreements. In this respect, it attempts to analyse empirically not only the EP’s interests and strategies about the CDCE and its place within the EU external relations, but also the ways that the EP shapes {{the process of the}} global governance of cultural industries, challenging its political asymmetries and hierarchies. In this sense, the paper draws five main conclusions: a. it illustrates a recent multiplication of EP resolutions and of written parliamentary questions towards the culture in EU external relations, and especially the link between trade agreements and culture; b. the EP seeks to promote a more normative position for the global governance of cultural industries, taking cultural concerns seriously into account; c. the negotiations between EU and United States reveal that the EP does not follow the pro-liberalization agenda of the European Commission and especially of <b>DG</b> <b>Trade.</b> On the contrary, the EP sided with the French government and the cultural professional organizations and it interpreted the CDCE as a normative tool protecting and promoting the cultural policies {{in the context of the}} trade negotiations; d. the EP’s votes towards the culture in EU external relations follow more the national cleavages existing within the European Council rather than a left-right divide, showing that the national lines seem to be a substantial factor in order to understand the EP’s preferences; e. despite the establishment of an international normative framework towards the cultural sector and the inclusion of the culture as a component of the EU foreign policy, the EP’s diplomacy has not yet fully integrated the culture among its priorities. In this sense, the different aspects of the cultural sector such as the cultural and creative industries or the tangible, natural and intangible cultural heritage are absent from the discussions of the EP with national and other regional parliaments.

In order to foster interdisciplinary and international dialogue on the topic, the workshop brought together well-established academics and policymakers from around the world, including: Péter Balás, Deputy Director General, <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> European Commission; Stefan Füle, former EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy; Pavel Kabat, Director General and Chief Executive Officer, IIASA; Evgeny Vinokurov, Director, Centre for Integration Studies, Eurasian Development Bank; Yuliya Chalaya, Head, Economic Policy Strategies Section, Macroeconomic Policy Department, Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) among many others, {{with a total of}} 34 participants. All speakers underlined the importance ofof an international dialogue for science-policy making on transport and infrastructure projects in Eurasia, particularly in the current context of the implementation of EU-UA AA/DCFTA. The global financial crisis, the US Fed and ECB QE policies, the EU’s fiscal situation and Western financial sanctions on Russia were raised during the discussion as serious bottlenecks for developing large scale infrastructure projects in Eurasia. Selected Seminar Highlights: The workshop concentrated on the major aspects related to transport and infrastructure development and generated the following outcomes: • a comprehensive review of the nexus of economic integration and modernization of passenger and freight transport and logistics infrastructure, including railways (notably, high-speed ground transportation), roads, air and maritime transport; and their impacts on economic, national security and social stability; •analysis of the future of transport corridors in Eurasia: prospects for cooperation among the countries of the region in the construction, modernization and further development of the Eurasian transport corridors (such as the Silk Way Economic Belt, the Trans-Siberian Railway, the “Razvitie” belt, the “Eurasia” waterway) until 2030, in particular, the development of trans-border transport infrastructures and perspectives of the Trans-Eurasian transit; • a detailed survey of opportunities and threats for the cooperation, feasibility and possibilities for win-win solutions in the context of large infrastructure (gas pipelines, waterways, etc.) developments in Eurasia. Seminar Focus Areas: During the workshop the participants came to distinguish four focus points: 1. Overview of transport and infrastructure projects in Eurasia 2. Means of financing of mega transport and infrastructure projects in Eurasia 3. Global players’ logistics interests: playing ball or playing hard? 4.

The research and expert communities are now challenged to provide solid, independent and comprehensive analysis and advice to policy-makers on the plausible future scenarios and optimal schemes of economic integration within the EAEU, as well as between the EAEU and its strategic partners, notably the EU. In order to foster interdisciplinary and international dialogue on the topic, the 2 d workshop on trade policy regomes invited distinguished scientists, policymakers and business representatives from all over the world, including Andrey Slepnev, Member of the Board – Minister in charge of Trade, Eurasian Economic Commission; Peter Balas, Deputy Director General, <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> European Commission; Stephan Nolte, Senior Economist, <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> European Commission (EC), Pavel Kabat, Director General and Chief Executive Officer, IIASA; Evgeny Vinokurov, Director, Centre for Integration Studies, Eurasian Development Bank; Alexander Knobel, Head, Foreign Trade Department, Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy (Gaidar Institute), Natalia Volchkova, Policy Director, Center for Economic and Financial Research, Assistant Professor, New Economic School, Rahim Oshakbaev, First Deputy Chairman of the Board, National Chamber of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan, Stefan Meister, Senior Policy Fellow, European Council of Foreign Relations, among many others, with a total of 45 participants. Thus, the aim of the workshop was to challenge research and expert communities to provide solid, independent and comprehensive support to policy-making on plausible future scenarios and optimal schemes of economic integration within the EAEU, and between the EAEU and its strategic partners. It should be noted, however, that the timing of the workshop has turned out as less than optimal: it coincided with the introduction of the second wave of major sanctions by Western countries, including the EU, against Russia due to the escalating military conflict in the Eastern part of Ukraine. This fact has much influenced the discussion, making it clear that even if the political events are outside the scope of the work of researchers, these still very much influence the possibilities of elaborating realistic solutions and advices, and even more, putting those to practical use...|$|E
40|$|The 4 th {{workshop}} {{within the}} IIASA project “Challenges and Opportunities of Economic Integration within a Wider European and Eurasian Space” held on 12 - 13 May, 2015 in Laxenburg, Austria delivered the latest {{insights into the}} risks, uncertainties, trends and opportunities around energy trade and energy security of the EU, EAEU and neighboring countries. The discussions focused mostly on natural gas covering conventional, LNG and shale gas, on nuclear energy, {{as well as on}} the potential for a common electricity market between some EU, EAEU and neighboring countries. To foster interdisciplinary and international dialogue on the topic, the workshop invited distinguished academics and policymakers from around the world, including Tair Mansurov, Member of the Board – Minister in charge of Energy and Infrastructure, Eurasian Economic Commission; Péter Balás, Deputy Director General, <b>DG</b> <b>Trade,</b> European Commission and Head, Support Group for Ukraine; Jean-Arnold Vinois, European Commission Directorate General for Energy; Pavel Kabat, Director General and Chief Executive Officer, IIASA; Evgeny Vinokurov, Director, Centre for Integration Studies, Eurasian Development Bank; among many others, with a total of 48 participants. The participants had impassionate exchanges over sometimes rather different views, yet they were able to concur on a number of points. This demonstrates the value of IIASA as a platform for open exchange of views between European and Eurasian experts and policymakers on currently controversial issues in the context of Euro-Eurasian economic integration. Selected Seminar Highlights: During the course of the seminar, the experts brought forward the following proposals: • Creation of a common EU - EAEU electricity market could be useful, since it could stimulate large-scale construction of various types of generation assets in the Kaliningrad Region and in Belarus (nuclear, hydro and thermal power stations), that could provide power to Poland, Lithuania and other neighboring countries. • Euro-Eurasian energy cooperation could be enhanced on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty (1998) mechanism (although in case of Russia only if it decides to revise its earlier decision to leave the Treaty). • Development by the Eurasian Economic Commission of a common Emissions Trading System (ETS) in line with EU norms can help increase compatibility in the future thus enhancing prospects of a common EU - EAEU emission inventory market. • Joint development of the Arctic shelf can be a promising and prestigious long-term project of economic and investment cooperation between the EU and Russia. • Commitment towards the work of the EU - Russia Gas Advisory Council and the “EU-Russia Gas Cooperation Roadmap till 2050 ” could be increased by both – Russia and the EU member states. • An international gas research cooperation program between the European Commission and research institutes of different regional players (not only Russia) could be established which might help gaining objectivity and transparency on forecasts in the gas market. • The repeated gas supply crises between Russia and the EU over supply to and transit via Ukraine make the efforts on maintaining cooperation and dialogue between the two even more important. • Despite the fact that Ukraine intends to integrate its energy system into the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), maintaining interconnections with the Russian and Belarusian electricity grid can help them decrease electricity price inflation during the transition period. • Energy efficiency in the Ukrainian household sector is a topic of joint interests and needs. Participants of the seminar proposed cooperation between the Eurasian Economic Commission and the respective Ukrainian research institutions for comparing approaches being adopted both in Ukraine and by the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union. • IIASA’s role as a platform for discussing energy matters between the EU and Russia/EAEU as equals can be crucial. Seminar Focus Areas: During the workshop the participants came to distinguish six game changers that currently affect Euro-Eurasian energy relations and policies. 1. Gas supply diversification of the European market and the rise of shale and LNG 2. Two cornerstones of the EU energy policy – anti-monopoly and supra-national regulations 3. Prospects and implications of energy efficiency improvements and climate change targets across the region 4. Local and regional effects of the Ukrainian crisis onto Euro-Eurasian energy relations and policies 5. Perspectives of the new energy deals between China and Russia 6. Perspectives of EU - EAEU energy market integratio...|$|E
