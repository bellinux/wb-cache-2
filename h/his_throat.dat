Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still in <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> bitten out.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} pain in <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys.

5|$|In {{his early}} career Redding mostly covered songs from popular artists, such as Richard, Cooke and Solomon Burke.

He often worked on lyrics with other musicians, such as Simms, Rodgers, Huckaby, Phil Walden and Cropper. During his recovery from <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> operation, Redding wrote about 30 songs in two weeks. Redding {{was the sole}} copyright holder on all of his songs.|$|E

Mulder is then locked in a storeroom.|$|E

5|$|A {{weather station}} in Norfolk, Virginia {{recorded}} gusts of 3844mph (6171km/h) and 0.17inches (4.31mm) of rainfall. In Cape Henry, sustained winds of 42mph (68km/h) and a precipitation total of 0.02inches (0.5mm) were reported.

One indirect fatality was attributed from Gladys {{when a man}} suffered fatal wounds to <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> due to flying debris. High winds and strong ocean currents from Gladys produced beach erosion in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. In Rhode Island, the outer bands of Gladys produced light rainfall, peaking at 0.38inches (9.6mm).

5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912.

The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison.
