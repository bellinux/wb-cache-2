5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, {{and that it would}} be paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E

5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E

Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E

5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley {{to the south and}} west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E

Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news that devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E
