50|$|The {{wheel hub}} motor (also called wheel motor, wheel hub <b>drive,</b> <b>hub</b> motor or in-wheel motor) is an {{electric}} motor that is incorporated into the hub of a wheel and drives it directly.|$|E
50|$|From a {{mechanical}} viewpoint, up to 99% {{of the energy}} delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels (clean, lubricated new chain at 400W), although the use of gearing mechanisms reduces this by 1-7% (clean, well-lubricated derailleurs), 4-12% (chain with 3-speed hubs), or 10-20% (shaft drive with 3-speed hubs). The higher efficiencies in each range are achieved at higher power levels and in direct <b>drive</b> (<b>hub</b> gears) or with large driven cogs (derailleurs).|$|E
50|$|The UFO {{consists}} of twelve, four-person gondolas, mounted {{in a circle}} around a central <b>drive</b> <b>hub.</b> This hub is in turn connected to a hydraulic arm. The ride is rotated to produce enough centrifugal force to stick the riders to the wall of the gondala furthest from the centre. Once this is achieved, the hydraulic arm is used to move the entire ride from the horizontal position to near-vertical. The time between the ride beginning to spin and the ride reaching near-vertical is approximately sixty seconds. The ride must be lowered back to the horizontal position before the rotation can cease.|$|E
5000|$|In high gear, the {{sprocket}} {{drives the}} planet carrier and the annulus <b>drives</b> the <b>hub,</b> {{resulting in a}} gear increase.|$|R

50|$|A small {{diameter}} {{saw blade}} is {{less expensive and}} requires less torque to drive.A thinner saw blade is wasting less material and needs less energy to turn.Therefore, it is desired to use smaller diameter <b>drive</b> <b>hubs</b> for blade mounting and thinner blades {{to be able to}} saw larger diameter material with smaller diameter saw blades. These criteria however weaken the lateral stiffness of the blade and the blade may vibrate more due to the large diameter / blade thickness ratio.|$|R
50|$|DK Bicycles {{introduced}} the Dual <b>Drive</b> <b>hub</b> {{back in the}} early 2000s which is a BMX Left/Right drive flip flop hub with the smaller sized metric (30 mm x 1 mm) BMX threads for 13T-15T freewheels, but also includes two threaded adapters, one left and one right, threaded inside to match the smaller metric threads and threaded on the outside with standard ISO threads. This allows the hub to use any size or combination of left and right drive freewheels available. Other companies like Wethepeople also made these dual-threaded metric hubs for a short time before cassette hubs enabled the use of much smaller rear cogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common types of hub motors used in {{electric}} bicycles are brushed and brushless. There are many possible types of electric motorized bicycles with several technologies available, varying in cost and complexity; direct-drive and geared motor units are both used. An electric power-assist {{system may be}} added to almost any pedal cycle using chain drive, belt <b>drive,</b> <b>hub</b> motors or friction drive. BLDC hub motors are a common modern design with the motor built into the wheel hub itself and the stator fixed solidly to the axle and the magnets attached to and rotating with the wheel. The bicycle wheel hub is the motor. The power levels of motors used are influenced by available legal categories and are often, but not always limited to under 750 watts.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator <b>drive</b> <b>hub</b> fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E

5000|$|I-O Data (Kabushikigaisha Ai-Ō Dēta Kiki) is a Japanese {{computer}} peripheral manufacturer. They manufacture hard disk <b>drives,</b> Ethernet <b>hubs,</b> USB cables, etc. [...] "I-O" [...] stands for [...] "input/output".|$|R
5000|$|Most of the time, low {{backlash}} case-hardened gears mounted in ball-or-taper-roller bearings are used. Depending {{on the size}} of the saw blades, a maximum of five gear sets with a gear reduction of up to 40:1 can be used. Variable speed motors of up to 150 KW drive the gearbox directly or via timing or [...] "V" [...] belts. Many saws have the blade mounting flange integrated within the spindle. This is less expensive, but requires expensive maintenance when the blade mounting surfaces wear. However, some more innovative saws have removable <b>drive</b> <b>hubs</b> which are mounted rigidly, and can be easily replaced. Some saws also use flywheels on the input shaft of the gearbox to smooth the fluctuating torque.|$|R

40|$|The {{multi-speed}} <b>drive</b> <b>hub</b> {{stored on}} the rear wheel of a bicycle is an important speed-changing device to adjust the pedaling force and driving speed. This paper proposes a feasible gear-shifting control mechanism of an 8 -speed distributed-flow-type transmission mechanism. A transmission mechanism consisting of two parallel-connected transmission units and one differential unit is introduced first. Then, based on the clutching sequence table, the embodiment design of a gear-shifting control mechanism is presented to selectively control the engagement of pawl-and-ratchet clutches and slot-with-block clutches as well as govern the power-flow path. The power-flow path at each speed-stage of this 8 -speed <b>drive</b> <b>hub</b> is analyzed to verify the feasibility of the proposed design...|$|E

40|$|There are {{millions}} of people who have lost their abilities to walk and wheelchairs offer the ONLY opportunities for their interactions with people and environments outside their houses. These individuals {{are becoming more and more}} eager to adapt modern technologies on their wheelchairs to improve quality of social life and the life of freedom. However, most available electric wheelchairs, driven by traditional lead-acid batteries and gear motors, are heavy and bulky in design with low energy efficiency, limited travel radius, and scarce communication/navigation functionalities. This project is to design and prototype an electric wheelchair that is lighter, more flexible in mobility, and more energy-efficient. It will use light-weight high power density Li-ion batteries and be driven by the light and energy-efficient direct <b>drive</b> <b>hub</b> motors. It will be also designed to readily integrate with high-tech accessories for increased independence, connectivity, and useful mobility for disabled individuals. This research is focused on the following four tasks: 1) installing and testing Li-ion battery performances to prolong the wheelchair running time per charge; 2) installing and testing direct-drive hub motor to reduce the weight and energy loss; 3) designing a dynamometer based on eddy current theory to determine the efficiency of electrical motor; and 4) designing several functional components/accessories, such as iPad holder, automated battery release drawer, and wheel-extend mechanism to improve consumers 2 ̆ 7 onboard independence and convenienc...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 85) Today???s Mechanical Engineering {{field is}} growing rapidly in designing techniques to manufacture Splines and Gears. Over the decades, numerous methods and manufacturing processes {{have been used}} in making the various kinds of Splines based on various criteria, including applications, reliability, life time, processing time and manufacturing cost. This thesis is also carried out with the same notion of experimenting to manufacture an External Involute Spline cutting tool using state-of-art CAD/CAM package and current trend CNC machines like Brother HS- 70 A Wire Electrical Discharge Machine and HAAS VF- 2 Vertical Milling Machine. This thesis is divided into two distinct phases: (1) analysis phase and (2) manufacturing phase. The analysis phase is dedicated to the study and simulation of involute splines, while the manufacturing phase covers the actual manufacturing process. This thesis starts with the extensive study of splines and the two different kinds of splines; a) Internal Involute splines and b) External Involute splines. The primary objective is to design the internal involute spline in Dassault Systems??? SolidWorks??. This entire design process is to be automated with embedding Microsoft EXCEL Spreadsheet with SolidWorks. Using this EXCEL spreadsheet, spline design parameters iterations are carried out in SolidWorks with the help of design tables. Based on the calculations made in EXCEL Spreadsheets and CAD design in SolidWorks, CNC machining parameters are defined in DP Technology???s CAM package ESPRIT and the machining process as well as tool/insert design is simulated. The main objective is to manufacture a spline cutting tool using Wire EDM machining process. For this Solid Carbide Machine Inserts are chosen as a cutting tool which cuts the external splines. Once the machine insert was manufactured, it was tested on 6061 Aluminum test specimen and successfully cut on 4340 Steel Drive shaft on the CNC Milling machine. These external splines are the inverse of the Involute splines on the drive shaft hub of the FSAE Formula one car. It can be concluded that, the involute spline cutting tool was successfully manufactured and tested by cutting external involute splines on drive shaft which match with internal splines on <b>drive</b> <b>hub...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{intrinsic}} connectivity of {{the default}} mode network {{has been associated}} with the level of consciousness in patients with severe brain injury. Especially medial parietal regions are considered to be highly involved in impaired consciousness. To better understand what aspect of this intrinsic architecture is linked to consciousness, we applied spectral dynamic causal modeling to assess effective connectivity within the default mode network in patients with disorders of consciousness. We included 12 controls, 12 patients in minimally conscious state and 13 in vegetative state in this study. For each subject, we first defined the four key regions of the default mode network employing a subject-specific independent component analysis approach. The resulting regions were then included as nodes in a spectral dynamic causal modeling analysis in order to assess how the causal interactions across these regions as well as the characteristics of neuronal fluctuations change with the level of consciousness. The resulting pattern of interaction in controls identified the posterior cingulate cortex as the main <b>driven</b> <b>hub</b> with positive afferent but negative efferent connections. In patients, this pattern appears to be disrupted. Moreover, the vegetative state patients exhibit significantly reduced self-inhibition and increased oscillations in the posterior cingulate cortex compared to minimally conscious state and controls. Finally, the degree of self-inhibition and strength of oscillation in this region is correlated with the level of consciousness. These findings indicate that the equilibrium between excitatory connectivity towards posterior cingulate cortex and its feedback projections is a key aspect of the relationship between alterations in consciousness after severe brain injury and the intrinsic functional architecture of the default mode network. This impairment might be principally due to the disruption of the mechanisms underlying self-inhibition and neuronal oscillations in the posterior cingulate cortex...|$|R

50|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} Jeffery Quad truck became an {{important}} product for Nash. Approximately 11,500 Quads were built between 1913 and 1919. They served to move material during World War I under severe conditions. The Quad used Meuhl differentials with half-shafts mounted above the load-bearing dead axles to <b>drive</b> the <b>hubs</b> through hub-reduction gearing. In addition, it featured four-wheel steering. The Quad achieved {{the reputation of being}} the best four-wheel drive truck produced in the country. The newly formed Nash Motors became the largest producer of four-wheel drives. By 1918, capacity constraints at Nash meant the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Company began to assemble the Nash Quad under license and Nash patents. Nash became the leading producer of military trucks by the end of World War I. After the war ended, surplus Quads were used as heavy work trucks in fields such as construction and logging.|$|R
