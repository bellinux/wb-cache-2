50|$|An Armstrong Whitworth <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcar</b> {{operated}} a luxury 12-seat express {{service on the}} LMS for two weeks in 1933 between London and Castle Bromwich near Birmingham {{in connection with a}} British Industries Fair. This car, with body work by Cravens which incorporated a kitchen, was powered by a standard Armstrong-Saurer 250 bhp engine.|$|E
50|$|With the {{increased}} capacity, the railway kept growing. In 1925 it bought seven more cars to handle higher passenger volumes, and 11 more freight cars. Seven years later, in 1932, it bought a <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcar</b> {{that had always}} been part of its original plans and added a special stall for it in Lysekil.|$|E

50|$|Five <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcars,</b> {{introduced}} in 1981, {{are used to}} operate a service every two hours over the Mur Valley Railway. In the summer months the STLB operates weekend steam-hauled services between Murau, where the main workshop are, and Tamsweg.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was decided}} to {{introduce}} the railcar to a daytime service between Auckland and Wellington. [...] This service, which started on Monday 23 September 1968, was highly successful and prompted the conversion of two further cars to 82 seats each to accommodate larger servery areas and, later, {{the purchase of the}} Silver Fern <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcars</b> for this service.|$|R
50|$|The nineteen-thirties were {{a decade}} of {{innovation}} and modernisation for DSB. New railway bridges were built across the Little Belt (1935), the Storstrøm (1937) and Oddesund (1938), eliminating the costly and time-consuming process of transfer by steam ferry. The suburban lines in and around Copenhagen were electrified for multiple-unit operation at 1,500 Volts DC (S-trains). Early experiments with Diesel propulsion {{led to the development}} of the all-purpose MO class heavy <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcar</b> equipped for multiple-unit operation, after World War II also fitted for push-pull operation with a driving trailer. Several classes of mainline diesel-electric locomotives were also built as prototypes by Burmeister and Wain of Copenhagen and Frichs of Aarhus, but further development was cut short by the German occupation and the consequent shortage of oil supplies, forcing DSB to rely on coal-burning steam locomotives for mainline duties.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} maximizing the power produced by an organic rankine cycle (ORC) {{waste heat recovery system}} on board a <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcar.</b> A simplified model of the system allows the formulation of an optimal control problem that can be solved via dynamic programming (DP). To increase the smoothness and the accuracy of the solution obtained offline using the implementation of DP known as level-set DP, an improved version is developed, making use of adaptive grids for discretization. The analysis of the resulting optimal trajectory for the ORC control problem provides useful insight for both control design and system design. Based on these results, the optimal control problem is reformulated allowing online implementation via dynamic real-time optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a realistic simulator, showing significant benefits in the amount of recovered energy when compared with the classical, quasi-static approach found in ORC literature...|$|E
50|$|Seaboard Air Line 2027 and 2028 were lightweight, {{streamlined}} <b>Diesel-electric</b> <b>railcars</b> {{built by}} the St. Louis Car Company in 1936. Electromotive Corporation supplied the , eight-cylinder Winton Diesel 201-A prime mover and electric transmission components. The units had a B-2 wheel arrangement, mounted atop a pair of road trucks. The aft section was divided into two separate compartments: one was used to transport baggage and the other served as a small railway post office, or RPO (the forward door, located just behind the radiator louvers, was equipped with a mail hook).|$|R
5000|$|The London and North Eastern Railway used a {{small number}} of petrol and diesel locomotives. [...] These {{included}} the LNER Class Y11 petrol locomotives, the diesel shunters which later became British Rail Class D3/9 and British Rail Class D3/14 and the Kitson-Still steam diesel hybrid locomotive. During the 1930s, Armstrong Whitworth supplied an experimental 1-Co-1 diesel-electric locomotive [...] and several <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcars.</b> In the 1940s, the LNER had some main-line diesel locomotives on order. These would have been similar to the British Rail Class D16/1 and British Rail Class D16/2 but the order was cancelled after nationalisation in 1948.|$|R
25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally braked (service braking) using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>railcars</b> were service braked using hydraulic brakes and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|R
2500|$|In 1914, world's first {{functional}} <b>diesel–electric</b> <b>railcars</b> {{were produced}} for the Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen (Royal Saxon State Railways) by Waggonfabrik Rastatt with electric equipment from Brown, Boveri & Cie and diesel engines from Swiss Sulzer AG. They {{were classified as}} DET 1 and DET 2 (...) [...] Due to shortage of petrol products during World War I, they remained unused for regular service in Germany. In 1922, they were sold to Swiss Compagnie du Chemin de fer Régional du Val-de-Travers (...) , where they were used in regular service up to the electrification of the line in 1944. Afterwards, the company kept them in service as boosters till 1965.|$|R

50|$|The NZR RM class Silver Fern is a {{class of}} rail motor in New Zealand. The three {{air-conditioned}} and sound-proofed 723-kW 96-seater <b>diesel-electric</b> twin-set <b>railcars</b> were built by Kawasaki and Toshiba, trading as Nissho Iwai Company of Japan. The New Zealand Railways classed the railcars RM, like all other railcars.|$|R
2500|$|A {{significant}} breakthrough {{occurred in}} 1914, when Hermann Lemp, a General Electric electrical engineer, developed and patented a reliable direct current electrical control system (subsequent improvements were also patented by Lemp). [...] Lemp's design used a single lever to control both engine and generator in a coordinated fashion, {{and was the}} prototype for all diesel–electric locomotive control systems. In 1914, world's first functional <b>diesel–electric</b> <b>railcars</b> were produced for the Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen (Royal Saxon State Railways) by Waggonfabrik Rastatt with electric equipment from Brown, Boveri & Cie and diesel engines from Swiss Sulzer AG. They were classified as DET 1 and DET 2 (...) [...] The first regular use of diesel–electric locomotives was in switching (shunter) applications. General Electric produced several small switching locomotives in the 1930s (the famous [...] "44-tonner" [...] switcher was introduced in 1940) Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.|$|R
50|$|In September 2005, Stadler Rail won a bid {{to build}} six Stadler GTW <b>diesel-electric</b> light {{regional}} <b>railcars</b> for the system. Each of the vehicle's capital costs is about $6 million, and they run on 2 x 375 kW (510 Hp) = 750 kW (1020 Hp) diesel-electric engines. They are 9 ft wide and 134 ft long.|$|R
50|$|The 2'Bo' (AAR:2-B) {{arrangement}} {{has been}} used similarly, but rarely, for lightweight railcars that only needed two powered axles. Only one example is recorded, the <b>diesel-electric</b> four-car Rebel <b>railcars</b> of 1935. Three powercars were built, with a 600 bhp engine and two traction motors on a single bogie. Half of the powercar {{was used as a}} baggage car, supported by a conventional coaching stock unpowered bogie.|$|R
50|$|The railway depot's {{primary purpose}} is to service, {{refurbish}} and upgrade Transperth's A-Series railcars. The newer B-series railcars may also be stabled at Claisebrook railway depot for work that cannont be done at Mandurah or Nowergup {{at any time and}} for events such as the Australian Football League games on weekends at Domain Stadium. The depot has also recently started serving as the facility to maintain and refurbish the <b>diesel-electric</b> Transwa Australind <b>railcars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} Otahuhu to handle <b>diesel-electric</b> {{locomotive}} and <b>railcar</b> repair work was much improved in 1962 {{with the opening}} of a new Diesel Shop. Prior to entering service, many DA, DB, DH, and DX class locomotives first made a visit to Otahuhu for preparation. 88-seater railcars were also maintained, repaired and overhauled in this new facility. In 1971, the Silver Star carriages were tested and commissioned in the Diesel Shop, as were the Silver Fern railcars the following year. Several cars for the new Southerner service were overhauled at Otahuhu in 1970.|$|R
