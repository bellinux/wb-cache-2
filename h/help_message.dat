In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup <b>help</b> <b>message</b> to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page.

We address dynamic help generation adapted to users, to decrease the gap between them. We defined a domain concept tree as an expression of a system’s actual structure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} a way to optimize the help messages provided by the intelligent agent from a decision theoretic perspective. The study proposed an expected time-based optimization rule utilizing the time associated with processing a <b>help</b> <b>message</b> and its time saving as the trade-off criterion of whether to present a <b>help</b> <b>message</b> or not. The interface for providing help messages was also investigated to see how users respond to different interface types of intelligent help messages according to user knowledge and task complexity. Six hypotheses were proposed regarding the effectiveness and user satisfaction of the proposed optimization rule and the <b>help</b> <b>message</b> interface, and then they were tested in the two experiments. ^ In Experiment I, the expected time-based optimization rule was compared with no optimization rule and no <b>help</b> <b>message.</b> Thirty participants performed two tasks of troubleshooting a print quality issue using one of the three help provision conditions (optimized help messages, non-optimized help messages, and no help messages). In Experiment II, the effects of task complexity and user knowledge were tested on the two <b>help</b> <b>message</b> interfaces with forty subjects. ^ The results of two experiments revealed the following: 1) the expected time-based optimization rule can significantly reduce user performance time and enhance user satisfaction for the complex task; 2) providing help messages for the simple task does not reduce performance time nor increase user satisfaction; 3) users are more satisfied with the help messages in a less intrusive interface regardless of task type and user knowledge. The combined results suggest that the intelligent help messages need to be presented in a less intrusive interface according to the expected time-based optimization rule to improve performance time and user satisfaction. The help optimization approach based on the expected time is expected to provide guidance as to where, when and why the intelligent help messages are likely to be effective or ineffective by utilizing quantitative predictions of value and cost of intelligent help messages in time. ...|$|E

To enrich this communication speech may be applied, both as an input and output medium. This chapter describes human factors research on the application of speech in four areas: <b>HELP</b> <b>messages,</b> annotation of documents, speech-to-text conversion and electronic diary-keeping. In the latter three areas voice commands were also used for system control. Regarding the first area, instruction (<b>HELP</b> <b>messages),</b> {{it was found that}} learning may proceed as fast with speech as with text and possibly be more thorough. A number of subjects preferred speech over text for learning. In the second area, annotation of documents, voice annotations {{turned out to be more}} efficient to make than text annotations which is reflected in preference rates: 2 - 1. This picture changes for receiving annotations from somebody else, however: processing times are the same or longer for voice than for text annotations, and only 25 % of subjects preferred processing voice annotations. In the third area, speech-totext conversion, subjects preferred voice over manual commands for layout and typographic control as well as for corrective purposes. Voice commands were also preferred over manual ones in the fourth area, diary keeping. Practical guidelines are given for the application of speech in all four areas, including the use of speech recognition per se...|$|R
