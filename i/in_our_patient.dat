Dr.Ravikumar’s surgical team has, {{over the past six}} years outperformed the outcomes of both, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons of America. His crude mortality rate is 1.4% for all comers in cardiac surgery as opposed to the above mentioned societies risk adjusted mortality rates of 2.25%. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> population there were sicker patients (complicated aneurysm surgery, triple valve replacements, cases with severe cardiac dysfunction, combined heart operations, etc. If we risk adjust, then our outcomes will be far superior).|$|E
5000|$|Reports of {{individual}} patients treated with anakinra illustrate its effectiveness. Beseda and Nossent (ibid.) report treating a longstanding multidrug resistant Schnitzler’s syndrome patient with anakinra: “Within 24 h {{after the first}} injection, both the urticaria and the fever disappeared and have not recurred. For the past 6 months, the patient has been in clinical and biochemical remission.” Other authors report “a complete resolution of symptoms” (Dybowski et al., 2008). Crouch et al. (2007) [...] report the effective treatment of a 52-year-old {{man who had been}} diagnosed with Schnitzler’s syndrome 8 years earlier: “On review, one week later, the patient’s systemic symptoms had resolved, and his previously elevated white cell count and inflammatory markers had normalised. The use of anakinra <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> resulted in resolution of symptoms and has enabled cessation of oral prednisolone. Our patient remains symptom free on anakinra after 14 months of follow-up”. Similar stories are reported by Frischmeyer-Guerrerio et al. (2008), Wastiaux et al. (2007), and Eiling et al. (2007), Schneider et al. (2007). De Koning et al. (2006) [...] treated three patients with Schnitzler’s syndrome with thalidomide and anakinra. Thalidomide was only effective for one of the three patients and was discontinued because of polyneuropathy. In contrast, for all three patients, anakinra “led to disappearance of fever and skin lesions within 24 hours. After a follow-up of 16-18 months, all patients are free of symptoms”. The authors concluded that anakinra as a treatment for Schnitzler’s syndrome “is preferable to thalidomide... as it has fewer side effects”.|$|E
30|$|Left {{ventricular}} {{function was}} preserved <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> cohort, {{did not change}} after PVI, and did not correlate with AF relapses. Therefore, our imaging results should not be confounded {{by the presence of}} heart failure. Moreover, relevant coronary artery disease was excluded <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> cohort.|$|E

30|$|Conclusion: We {{observed}} a high cancer incidence of about 21 % <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> {{compared to the}} low rate of 2 % thyroid cancer patients of new cancer cases <b>in</b> Austria. To <b>our</b> opinion a stringent patient selection in the interdisciplinary preoperative management of thyroid patients according to guidelines is the decisive factor for this high rate of thyroid cancer <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> RHV-MHV anastomoses {{were not}} seen on {{contrast}} CT {{before the first}} hepatectomy; therefore, the intrahepatic collaterals developed after severing the RHV. Previous reports revealed that these collaterals could develop approximately 10  days after severing the major hepatic veins [17]. Based on this finding, we could have shortened the interval between the two hepatectomies, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E
30|$|Sometime, it is {{difficult}} to differentiate symmetrical polyarthritis due to leprosy from rheumatoid arthritis as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b> This question was entertained upon initial presentation of our patient with symmetrical polyarthritis. Absence of rheumatoid nodule, extra articular manifestation, patient being male, good response to anti leprosy treatment, and absence of Rheumatoid factor and anti-ccp are the clinical distinguishing features from rheumatoid arthritis <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients,</b> cast {{immobilization}} over {{a period}} of 4  weeks was found to be the cause of fracture in 37 % (n =  62) of cases, which is lower than the values of 43 % and 52 % reported in the literature [30, 33]. These comparatively low rates <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> might indicate a positive trend as a result of knowledge gained in the past few decades.|$|R
40|$|The normal aorta {{has three}} {{branches}} from its arch, but variations in this pattern are not uncommon. Our interest was to correlate the documented statistics to the variants observed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> This {{was done by}} randomly selecting 60 patients on whom arch aortograms were performed. <b>Our</b> <b>patients</b> did not demonstrate all of the variants described. There was close correlation between the documented values and <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> except for the aberrant right subclavian artery which was {{more than three times}} more common <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

30|$|Importantly, current {{available}} {{data do not}} allow concluding on optimal choice, timing and dosage of immunomodulating strategies in this clinical setting {{and the role of}} additional infection-induced acquired immunodeficiency (Hotchkiss et al. 2013; Schefold et al. 2008) remains enigmatic. However, despite advanced immunosuppressive treatment, it seems worth to note that severe secondary infection was not noted <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b> Unfortunately, we observed that despite early anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy, clinical success was limited <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E
30|$|Several {{authors have}} {{reported}} about nontuberculous mycobacterial infections after periocular surgery [3, 4]. The median time interval between prior surgery and onset of infection in these reports was 6  weeks (range 0.5 – 11  months) [3, 4]. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> multiple erythematous nodules with suppuration along the tract of the silicone rod more than 2  years after surgery {{led to the}} suspicion and eventual diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacteria. Some aspects <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> need to be highlighted.|$|E
40|$|Infiltration of old scars by sarcoidal {{granuloma}} is not uncommon. However, pathogenesis of scar sarcoid is not clear. Peculiar {{involvement of}} {{road traffic accident}} scars with sparing of postoperative scar by granulomatous infiltrate <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> suggests that foreign body contamination is essential {{in the evolution of}} scar sariod. Scar sarcoid can have systemic involvement at the outset in contradistinction to earlier reports as illustrated <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b> Corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of these patients...|$|E

30|$|Although rubella {{virus has}} been {{described}} in the etiology of FHI, we did not detect the rubella virus <b>in</b> any of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Antigen-antibody complexes [15] in the aqueous sample were not done <b>in</b> any of <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> due to financial constraints. This {{is one of the}} limitations of this study and would have probably given us more comprehensive information regarding the association of rubella virus <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> with FHI, especially in those eyes presenting with increased IOP.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an infant with an anomalous left coronary artery {{arising from the}} pulmonary trunk leading to myocardial ischaemia and development of an apical aneurysm of the left ventricle. Clinical presentation in general is based on myocardial hypoperfusion resulting in ischaemia and infarction. When presenting in infancy, however, then the features, as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> may be tachypnea, dyspnea, failure to thrive and irritability, especially during feeding. Then, again as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> {{it is possible to}} miss the definitive diagnosis, which is made by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Reimplantation of the anomalous left coronary artery into the aorta usually results in improvement of left ventricular function over time. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> the myocardial infarction was complicated by formation of an aneurysm, and reimplantation alone was not sufficient to restore cardiac function. Resection of the aneurysm greatly improved the hemodynamics...|$|E

30|$|In the sarcomatοid type of {{metaplastic}} breast carcinoma, {{which was}} the variety encountered <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> there is a gradual transition from carcinomatous to sarcoma-like elements.|$|E
30|$|Other {{differentials}} {{that may}} be considered <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> mainly include acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). Confluent deep plaques of yellow-white discoloration of the fundus {{may be seen in}} APMPPE. However, unlike the present case, lesions are typically more distinct, not associated with macular granularity and bilateral. The geographic hypofluorescent area present from the early to the late ICGA phase and early hypofluorescence on FA are also compatible with the diagnosis of APMPPE <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient.</b> In fact, initial hypofluorescence on ICGA and FA is {{due to the lack of}} choriocapillaris perfusion in typical cases of APMPPE. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> the very extensive FA and ICGA hypofluorescence reflects the severity of choriocapillaris inflammation and ischemia. However, in APMPPE, there is typically a pronounced placoid hyperfluorescence in the late FA phase corresponding to the areas of hypofluorescence in the early FA, which was not observed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> [11]. Disruption of the outer retina and choroidal thickening on OCT, and areas of flow deficit on OCTA as evidenced in the present case have already been described as possible findings in APMPPE [12, 13]. But, the residual scars are typically more marked on FAF and FA in patients with APMPPE as compared to the reported case [11].|$|E

30|$|Conclusion According to <b>our</b> data, <b>patients</b> with {{septic shock}} had {{impaired}} cerebral autoregulation {{within the first}} 24  hours of their admission in the ICU. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients,</b> we described a variability of distribution of impaired autoregulation according to time.|$|R
30|$|Some of the {{patients}} had hyponatremia, which is sometimes found in elderly patients [3]. The mean preoperative sodium concentration was 136 [*]±[*] 5.4  mEq/l <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients,</b> although five (10 %) patients had a sodium level of < 130  mEq/l. Radical perioperative fluid therapy could raise the sodium concentration {{to a point that}} causes osmotic demyelination syndrome [4]. We administered 1 % glucose lactated Ringer’s solution (2.9 [*]±[*] 1.1  ml/kg/h) during anesthesia <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Surgical closure of the larynx poses little risk of massive bleeding. However, these patients were chronically dehydrated, so fluid administration was increased during the perioperative period.|$|R
