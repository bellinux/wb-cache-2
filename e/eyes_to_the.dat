5|$|Shadows Fall {{toured the}} New England area opening for {{artists such as}} Fear Factory and Cannibal Corpse. On November 30, 1997, the band {{released}} its first studio album Somber <b>Eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sky, through Bachand's recording label, Lifeless Records.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, Shadows Fall {{entered the}} studio to begin {{recording}} their seventh studio album. While in the studio, they held live video streams to discuss {{the progress of the}} album and answer questions from fans. This album is the first to be produced by Adam Dutkiewicz since the band's original studio release, Somber <b>Eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sky. Fire From the Sky was released on May 15, 2012 through Razor & Tie.|$|E
5|$|Around mid-September 1943, the two-man Bf 110 {{crew was}} {{augmented}} {{by a third}} member, {{sometimes referred to as}} Bordmechaniker (air mechanic) or Bordschütze (air gunner). The reason for this was that the decline of the Himmelbett procedure, the introduction of the broadcast procedure Zahme Sau, and the growing threat of RAF intruder night fighter operations, had necessitated the need for another pair of watchful <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. Unteroffizier Wilhelm Gänsler, who had already contributed to 17 claims made by Hauptmann Ludwig Becker, was Schnaufer's new lookout. With Handtke and Gänsler as his crew, Schnaufer claimed his 26th aerial victory on 23 September 1943 over a No. 218 Squadron Stirling during a Wilde Sau intercept mission.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Labonte {{was asked}} to leave the band due to {{personal}} and artistic differences. He had ideas for a side project while {{a member of the}} band, and went on to form All That Remains. The band looked for a replacement vocalist and eventually recruited Milford, MA native Brian Fair of the pioneering metalcore band Overcast. The band had been friends with Fair for years. After a US Summer tour with Shai Hulud, Overcast disbanded and the band asked Fair if he would like to join Shadows Fall. While on tour Shadows Fall was signed to Century Media Records. The band recorded its second studio album Of One Blood with Fair on vocals in 2000, and the release included re-recorded songs from Somber <b>Eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sky. In 2001, David Germain decided to leave the band due to alcoholism, and was replaced by former Stigmata and Burning Human drummer Jason Bittner.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to make light account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E
5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|Cogan occulomotor apraxia {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of development. Affected children have difficulty moving their eyes only to a new visual target, so they will turn their head past the target to “drag” the <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new object of interest, then turn the head back. This tendency becomes evident in late infancy and toddler years, and mostly improves with time. This contrasts to the oculomotor difficulties evident in children with A-T, which are not evident in early childhood but emerge over time. Cogan’s oculomotor apraxia is generally an isolated problem, or {{may be associated with}} broader developmental delay.|$|E

25|$|Pratyahara is {{fetching}} {{and bringing}} near one's awareness and one's thoughts to within. It {{is a process}} of withdrawing one's thoughts from external objects, things, person, situation. It is turning one's attention to one's true Self, one's inner world, experiencing and examining self. It is a step of self extraction and abstraction. Pratyahara is not consciously closing one's <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensory world, it is consciously closing one's mind processes to the sensory world. Pratyahara empowers one to stop being controlled by the external world, fetch one's attention to seek self-knowledge and experience the freedom innate in one's inner world.|$|E
25|$|A {{high school}} English teacher {{convinced}} {{him to go to}} college. He enrolled at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas, in 1965, intending to major in engineering. Living in south Texas made him curious about his roots there, and he enrolled in a Texas history which, he said, opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exploitation of Mexican Americans and farmworkers. A local Roman Catholic priest assisted him in obtaining financial aid, and he transferred to Ohio Northern College (a private, United Methodist Church-affiliated school) in 1966. He transferred to Bluffton College (a private, Mennonite-affiliated school) a year later. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was suddenly changed, however, and Philip was tardily forced {{again into the}} opposition against the Emperor, by the Treaty of Crépy of 1544, which opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> danger threatening Protestantism.

When this failed, he sought to secure the neutrality of Bavaria in a possible war against the Protestants and proposed a new Protestant alliance {{to take the place of}} the Schmalkaldic League.|$|E

25|$|The {{eye of a}} hook, {{although}} some hooks are technically eyeless, is {{the point where the}} hook is connected to the line. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hooks. Typical eye types include the ring or ball eye, a brazed eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye—traditional on Atlantic Salmon flies, needle eyes, and spade end—no eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the hook. Hook eyes can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank—up turned, down turned or straight.|$|E
25|$|Directly east of Verona was {{the suburb}} of Veronetta, which the Austrians had heavily fortified. In addition, the bridges between Verona and Veronetta were well-covered by Austrian artillery. Therefore, Masséna turned his <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of}} Verona, to the suburb of San Giorgio, which was {{accessible}} by a stone bridge known as the Castelvecchio Bridge (Ponte di Castelvecchio). Vukassovich was responsible for defending the area. The Austrian division commander had a wall built across {{the center of the}} bridge and fortified San Giorgio. However, Vukassovich only allocated two battalions to its defense. He deployed six battalions in the hills northeast of Verona, while the remainder of his division lay farther north, maintaining contact with Hiller's corps.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic fins have rounded {{tips and}} gently curved {{trailing}} margins. The whip-like tail measures {{about twice the}} length of the disc and bears one or two long stinging spines with up to 88 serrations. A narrow fin fold runs beneath the tail and ends well before the tail tip. Large juveniles and adults have a row of large, sharp thorns running along the midline of the back from behind the <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tail spine, and thorns of various sizes are also scattered about the dorsal surface of the disc. The tail behind the spine is densely covered by stout thorns. This species is a uniform dark brown or gray to black above and whitish below. The longer tail, presence of thorns, and absence of white dots atop the disc differentiate this species from the short-tail stingray (D. brevicaudata), another giant stingray that shares its range.|$|E
