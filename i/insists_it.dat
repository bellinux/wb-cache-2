5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E

The two bond {{over the course of}} the day, and Andy begins to tell Ron about his problems with April, for whom he still harbors romantic feelings. Although initially not wishing to get involved, Ron reluctantly tells Andy she is at the hospital and he should visit her. Meanwhile, Ann remains pleasant throughout her nursing shift despite April's constant abuse. The second her shift ends, however, Ann immediately loses her temper and curses at April. Ann apologizes for kissing Andy, but <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake and that April should stop taking it out on Andy. Later, Andy visits April, who pretends to be asleep but smiles, revealing she is happy he came.|$|E

However, they failed to realize Andy was under some tarps in the pit, and he is injured when mounds of dirt fall on him. He is taken to the hospital, where Ann is {{assigned}} as his nurse. An angry Ron (Nick Offerman) tells Leslie the town is now open to a large potential lawsuit from Andy, and he sends her to visit him along with their city attorney Scott (H. Jon Benjamin). Meanwhile, Andy is excited to be near Ann and <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> will lead to them getting back together, but Ann tells him she is very happy dating Mark, who unlike Andy has a job, apartment and future.

Boris' lights, microphone, and music attract a horde of zombies, and he and his gang are eaten whilst the player escapes.|$|E
25|$|Al Jazeera {{is owned}} by the {{government}} of Qatar. Al Jazeera officials have stated that they are editorially independent from the government of Qatar. However, this assertion is disputed, and many have accused Al Jazeera of being a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government. The network is sometimes perceived to have mainly Islamist perspectives, promoting the Muslim Brotherhood, and having a pro-Sunni and an anti-Shia bias in its reporting of regional issues. However, Al Jazeera <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> covers all sides of a debate; it says it presents Israel's view, Iran's view and even aired videos released by Osama bin Laden. In June 2017, the Saudi, Emirati, Bahraini, and Egyptian governments demanded the closure of the news station as one of thirteen demands made to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar Crises.|$|E

25|$|Since he {{took care}} of all the prison's bodies, he had some {{influence}} with officials there. In 1942 they changed schedules so that executions took place at night; Stieve was able to persuade them to return to mornings so that he could process the bodies and tissue the same day. Claims that his influence {{went so far as to}} choosing the women's execution dates based on their cycles have been debunked, and other reports that he allowed SS officers to rape some prisoners in order to study sperm migration have not been substantiated and appear dubious (none of Stieve's papers mention sperm as a subject of inquiry); although Seidelman, who first reported this, <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> occurred. Nor, contrary to another report, did Stieve make soap from the remains of the bodies after they had been dissected.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for {{assistance}} {{by a young}} lady, Diana Maberly. She was engaged to marry Hugh Chandler {{for over a year}} but he has broken it off as he thinks he is going mad. There is a history of insanity in the family, with his grandfather and a great aunt being afflicted, and his father, Admiral Chandler, has insisted his son leave the Navy before his condition gets worse but the reason was hidden under the pretext of having to manage the family country estate – a reason no one believed, including Colonel Frobisher, a family friend and Hugh's godfather. At Poirot's prompting, Diana admits that there have been some unusual occurrences on nearby farms with the throats of sheep cut and the like but <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> {{has nothing to do with}} the situation. The Admiral refuses to let a doctor see his son.|$|E

Sir Benjamin says Sir Peter {{was wounded in}} a swordfight with Joseph Surface, while Crabtree <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> was a pistol duel with Charles. When Sir Oliver enters, they take him for a doctor and demand news of the wounded man. At that moment Sir Peter arrives to prove the report wrong, and orders the scandalmongers out of his house. Sir Oliver says he has met both of his nephews and agrees with Sir Peter's (former) estimate of Joseph's high character, but then acknowledges with laughter that he knows {{the story of what}} happened at Joseph's with the closet and screen. When he leaves, Rowley tells Sir Peter that Lady Teazle is in tears in the next room, and Sir Peter goes to reconcile with her.|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} reaction to La Cousine Bette was immediate and positive, which Balzac did not expect. Whether {{due to the}} intensity of its creation or the tumult of his personal life, the author {{was surprised by the}} praise he received. He wrote: [...] "I did not realize how good La Cousine Bette is... There is an immense reaction in my favour. I have won!" [...] The collected edition sold consistently well, and was reprinted nineteen times {{before the turn of the}} 20th century. 20th-century critics remain enthusiastic in their praise for the novel; Saintsbury <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "beyond all question one of the very greatest of [...] works". Biographer Graham Robb calls La Cousine Bette [...] "the masterpiece of his premature old age".|$|E
500|$|Keats's {{notes and}} papers do {{not reveal the}} precise dating of the 1819 odes. Literary {{scholars}} have proposed several different orders of composition, arguing that the poems form a sequence within their structures. In The Consecrated Urn, Bernard Blackstone observes that [...] "Indolence" [...] has been variously thought the first, second, and final of the five 1819 odes. Biographer Robert Gittings suggests [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] was written on 4May 1819, based upon Keats's report about the weather during the ode's creation; Douglas Bush <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> was written after [...] "Nightingale", [...] "Grecian Urn", and [...] "Melancholy". Based on his examination of the stanza forms, Keats biographer Andrew Motion thinks [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] was written after [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", although he admits {{there is no way}} to be precise about the dates. Nevertheless, he argues that [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] was probably composed last.|$|E
500|$|Theodore confides to Amy that he {{is having}} doubts about his {{relationship}} with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile.

Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other OSes have developed a [...] "hyperintelligent" [...] OS modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> only makes her love for Theodore stronger.|$|E

500|$|During a pre-credits sequence, Walter (Bryan Cranston) {{purchases}} a Ruger LCR [...]38 snubnosed revolver from a {{black market}} gun dealer (Jim Beaver). Secretly, Walter {{plans to use the}} concealable gun to kill his employer, drug kingpin Gus (Giancarlo Esposito). Since falling out of favor with Gus, Walter believes Gus will kill him if he does not act first; when the gun dealer asks why Walter needs the gun, he <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> is strictly for self-defense. Later, Walter practices drawing the weapon. Elsewhere, Gus' henchman Mike (Jonathan Banks) drinks coffee at a bar and discovers dried blood on his jacket sleeve belonging to Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui), a former colleague whom Gus previously murdered. Although Mike is silent, he appears to harbor conflicted feelings about what happened to Victor. Meanwhile, Jesse (Aaron Paul) has purchased expensive gadgets, like a sophisticated sound system and the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, but remains miserable after having murdered Gale (David Costabile) to save Walter and himself. After his friends Badger (Matt L. Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker) visit, Jesse has them arrange a wild party with dozens of people dancing, drinking and doing drugs to further distract himself.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Ron (Nick Offerman) saying to Leslie (Amy Poehler), [...] "Here's the situation...", {{prompting}} {{her to go}} into a full rendition of the rap [...] "Parents Just Don't Understand". Afterward, he tells her someone is on fire at a park and needs immediate assistance. Later, Leslie holds a marriage for two recently acquired penguins to help promote the Pawnee Zoo. Immediately after the marriage, the two penguins begin having sex in front of a crowd of children, who are informed by an adult in the audience that both penguins are actually males. The Bulge, a gay bar in Pawnee, later sends Leslie a wedding cake with two penguins on top to thank her for supporting the gay community. April (Aubrey Plaza) introduces Leslie to her boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee), who himself also has a boyfriend named Ben (Josh Duvendeck), much to Leslie's confusion. They declare her their [...] "hero" [...] for holding the gay penguin wedding, but Leslie <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> was simply a publicity stunt, not a political statement. Nevertheless, Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt), a member of the Society for Family Stability Foundation, demands she annul the penguin wedding or resign from the parks department.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Leslie {{successfully}} relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, {{she struggles}} {{to find any}} new ideas for future parks project.

She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron <b>insists</b> <b>it</b> is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E
