5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UK</b> in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>UK,</b> the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UK,</b> but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%).
