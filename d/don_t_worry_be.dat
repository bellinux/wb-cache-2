40|$|<b>Don</b> <b>t</b> <b>worry,</b> the {{headline}} <b>is</b> not another exhortation {{from on high}} to produce more. It is your own wish. Production of livestock, crops and vegetables are the subjects which our subscribers most want to read about, {{according to an analysis}} of the distribution of 66, 000 books ordered from CTA s Publications Distribution Service under the credit point scheme in 2002. Other top topics are information, training, marketing and organisation and management. These preferences confirm the responses to the Uses of Spore survey in 2002 which showed that more than one in four respondents wanted more coverage of livestock issues, and one in five more coverage of information and communication. The list (see table) of the Top 20 most ordered publications of which five from ACP publishers includes eight titles related to livestock, from beekeeping to animal breeding manuals. Top of the list is the manual Poultry, of which 960 copies were ordered, followed by Where there is no vet. Information and enterprise Another six titles relate to information skills, ranging from the specifics of Strengthening biometry (statistical analysis) to the broad overview of the Information revolutions taking place at community and national level throughout ACP countries; this group includes The ABC of book publishing and the Development of training materials. Of special note as the third most ordered book is the new guide to Setting up and running a small food business; its popularity has given new energy to the compilers of the series on food processing, of which this was the first to appear, in late 2001. Strong interest in sound agriculture practice is also clear: just creeping into the Top 20 is Producing food without pesticides, and the new survey of World markets for organic fruit and vegetables, published in mid- 2002, soon caught the interest of many subscribers. A similar picture exists in the parallel Top 20 French-language books, which is headed by L élevage de la volaille, the French edition of Poultry. There is a similar pattern of interests, but with some differences in titles: the popularity of a beekeeping book in English, for example, is matched by a book on duck rearing in French. Another common feature is the interest shown in series of publications. So many interests The Top 20 is, however, just the tip of a mass of titles for which there is a broad demand. If you ever wondered why the CTA Publications Catalogue is so thick, now you know. In all, orders were received for 650 of the approximately 680 titles on the CTA list, the difference due to some titles joining the list near the year s end, with the first orders coming in 2003. And, as in any shop, one or two items just did not get asked for. That idea of the shop holds true when it comes to special marketing efforts. When we draw attention in Spore to a new title, or to an old one whose sales are sagging, or do a special mailing to special interest groups you soon see the orders surge. But, once in the shop, people do like to have a good look around. Orders for the 20 favourite titles account for a quarter of the 36, 500 orders placed for English books, and a third of the 28, 500 orders for French titles. Most other orders were for the range of Portuguese-language titles in stock. Who wants to know? Two-thirds of all the publications ordered are intended for people who manage services or an enterprise (such as suppliers, traders and processors) and for communicators (such as extension and field workers). About a fifth are the hands-on, how-to manuals used by producer groups and their individual members. The remainder are publications for researchers and policy-makers on technical, political and socio-economic issues. This picture is the same for both French- and English-language titles, and reflects the composition of our subscribers list. Incidentally, this aspect of meeting needs is reflected by the fact that of the Top 20 titles, 18 English and 19 French are CTA s own publications or, predominantly, co-publications with another publisher. These are titles for which CTA identified a clear need from its constituency, and the demand has proved the Centre right. We shall not go into the detail of who is ordering which publications, because we all know that policy-makers keep chickens and farmers associations have an interest in following policy issues. If you re in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia or Nigeria, you ll be proud to know that your five countries often account for {{at least half of the}} orders for a title. There are, though, more than enough titles for every subscriber to get their fair share: in 2002, all subscribers together spent more than 1, 090, 000 credit points, but your kitty is not empty yet.

40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi investigar, a partir da perspectiva dos adolescentes, os sentimentos presentes na relação entre professores e alunos, vulneráveis socialmente, na Rede Pública de Ensino. Participaram oito adolescentes, sendo quatro meninos e quatro meninas, alunos e alunas de uma escola pública em Campinas. Os participantes estudavam na mesma escola, em horários e séries diferentes. Foi utilizada a metodologia de Grupos Focais. Buscou-se compreender os sentimentos decorrentes da relação professor-aluno em sala de aula, as situações indutoras destes sentimentos e como os adolescentes lidam com isso. Assim, espera-se, com essa compreensão, contribuir com os cursos de formação de professores. O estudo apontou para a importância do papel do educador como responsável em compreender e atender às necessidades específicas da faixa etária e em buscar diferentes estratégias e metodologias de ensino para atrair a curiosidade dos alunos. Pela fala destes, quando há compromisso por parte do docente, sentem-se vistos e respeitados, o que gera sentimentos de bem-estar e maior interesse pela matéria a ser ensinada. Porém, o contrário também é verdadeiro: há professores que não se preocupam com as necessidades específicas desses jovens, não se comprometem em elaborar uma boa aula, com diferentes dinâmicas e estratégias, e, além disso, comunicam aos adolescentes uma indiferença quanto ao seu desempenho e desenvolvimento, o que gera sentimentos de mal-estar e reações como: fazer bagunça, sair da sala, ficar com raiva, brigar com o professor, pixar a escola, ficar com dor de cabeça, ter vontade de desistir dos estudos e de sumir da escola, entre outros. Nesta análise, os sentimentos de mal-estar foram fortemente enfatizados pelos adolescentes, embora também mencionassem as situações geradoras de sentimentos de bem-estar. Esse fato aponta para a precariedade das relações entre professores e alunos da rede pública de ensino; entretanto, esses jovens ainda permanecem na escola por acreditarem que os estudos podem lhes oferecer condições de obterem um emprego melhorThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate, from the perspective of adolescents, the feelings in the teacher-student relationship, socially vulnerable, in the public education system. Eight adolescents, four boys and four girls, all students from a public school in Campinas participated in the research. The participants studied in the same school, but in different times and grades. The focal group methodology was used. The aim was to comprehend the feelings resulting from the teacher-student relationship in the classroom, the situations that induce these feelings and how the adolescents deal with it. Thus, it is hoped, with this understanding, to contribute with the teacher s formation courses. The study pointed out the importance {{of the role of the}} educator as the person responsible for the comprehension and address of the specific needs of each age group, and sought for different strategies and methodologies of teaching to attract the curiosity of the students. By their talk, when there is commitment by the teacher, they feel seen and respected, what generates feelings of well being and a greater interest in the subject to be taught. However, the opposite is also true: there <b>are</b> teachers who <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>worry</b> about the specific needs of these young people, that <b>don</b> <b>t</b> engage in preparing a good class, with different dynamics and strategies, and, beyond that, they pass indifference concerning the adolescents performance and development, which causes bad feelings and reactions such as: causing troubles, leaving class, becoming angry, fighting with teachers, painting the school walls, having headaches, willing to give up studies and to fleeing from school, among others. In this analysis, the bad feelings were greatly emphasized by the students, although they also mentioned the situations which generated good feelings. This fact points the precarious relationships between teachers and students in the public education system; however, these young people still remain at school believing that the studies can offer them the means to obtain a better jo...|$|R
