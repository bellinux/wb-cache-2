25|$|Nolte {{argued that}} the vast {{majority}} of Germans had no knowledge of the 'Holocaust while it was happening Nolte claimed that the genocide of the Jews was Hitler’s personal pet project, and that the Holocaust was the work of only a few Germans who were entirely unrepresentative of German society Contradicting the American historian Raul Hilberg, who claimed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were complicit in the Holocaust, from high-ranking bureaucrats to railway clerks and locomotive conductors, Nolte {{argued that the}} functional division of labour in modern society meant that most people in Germany had no idea of how they were assisting in genocide. In support of this, Nolte cited the voluminous memoirs of German generals and Nazi leaders, such as Albert Speer, who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> their country was engaging in genocide during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Gallo {{had never}} been written before the 20th century, and several writing systems were created. They are however rarely known by the {{population}} and signs in Gallo are often unreadable, even for fluent speakers. In Loire-Atlantique, where Gallo is not promoted at all by the local authorities, many people do not even know the word [...] "Gallo" [...] and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it has writing systems and publications.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, it {{has been}} accepted, courts often ruling {{that there is no}} {{expectation}} of privacy, citing California v. Greenwood (1985), in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home. Critics of this practice underline that this analogy ignores that [...] "most people <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, {{there is no way to}} avoid abandoning one's DNA in public." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1839, {{the numbers}} of mustangs in Texas had been {{augmented}} by animals abandoned by Mexican settlers who had been ordered to leave the Nueces Strip [...] Ulysses Grant, in his memoir, recalled seeing in 1846 an immense herd between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers in Texas. [...] "As {{far as the eye}} could reach to our right, the herd extended. To the left, it extended equally. [...] There was no estimating the number of animals in it; I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> they could all have been corralled in the state of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time." [...] When the area was finally ceded to the U.S. in 1848, these horses and others in the surrounding areas were rounded up and trailed north and east, resulting in the near elimination of mustangs in that area by 1860.|$|E

"I cannot {{think there}} is any danger of it," [...] was Emma's calm answer--"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's {{situation}} and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> you will suppose her talents can be unknown." ...|$|E

[...] "You're {{not going to}} take me alive, and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> you want to anyhow, and if you start {{anything}} in the killing line some of you are going to Davy Jones' locker along with me. The best thing for all concerned is to divide up this party now once and for all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] replied Hartley, scarce {{repressing}} his displeasure; [...] "and if I could induce Dr. Gray {{to dispense}} with so reasonable a condition, I should be very sorry to do so. You are but twenty-one, and if such a period of probation was, in the Doctor's prudence, judged necessary for me, who am full two years older, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he will dispense with it in yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George's {{mother is}} as old as I am, miss!--at least she was when we were at school. And Fanny Parker--Mrs. Mountain who now is--was seven months older, and we were in the French class together; and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> our age is to be made the subject of remarks and ridicule by our children, and I will thank you to spare it, if you please! Do you {{consider}} your mother too old, George?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, ay, I've known {{people who}} couldn't count beyond a certain number. Your real land-birds never know their own roosts, {{even in a}} {{landfall}} at sea. How many times have I seen the beach, and houses, and churches, when the passengers {{have not been able}} to see anything but water! I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a man can get fairly out of sight of land on fresh water. The thing appears to me to be irrational and impossible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exciting, par Dieu! Of {{course it}} will be exciting. They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> I guessed their little machinations. Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen {{travelling}} to Paris forsooth! Aye! but with five and twenty millions sewn somewhere inside her petticoats. Well! the Emperor happens to want his own five and twenty millions, if you please. So Mme. la Duchesse or M. le Comte will have to disgorge. And I shall have the pleasing task of making them disgorge. What say you to that, friend Clyffurde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She always {{declares}} {{she will}} never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all. But I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> she has yet ever seen a man she cared for. It {{would not be a}} bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} that {{teaching}} is so irksome to me. I am, in a sense, at it all day. But {{there is so}} much to be done, and the people, worthy souls, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> one can ever be tired. After I was laid down on my table, with my air-pillow under my head and my plaid over me, I woke up from a doze to find the worthy Tanoagnene sitting with his face towards me, waiting for a talk about the rather comprehensive subject of Baptism.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was well}} managed," [...] Gerald Burke {{said as they}} rode out of the town. [...] "The muleteers can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> you have but just joined me, {{and there is little}} chance of any of my comrades on board ship {{overtaking}} us, as all intend to stop for a few days to recruit themselves before going on. If they did they would not be likely to recognize you in your present attire, or to suspect that my Irish servant is the crazy boy of the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Genoese <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> you {{are going}} to put to sea. Their ships and galleys are, as usual, moored off the quays of Chioggia. The {{entrance}} to the Canal of Lombardy, and the Brondolo passage, are both quite open, and there appear to be no troops anywhere near; but between Pelestrina and Brondolo they have rowboats watching the entrance, but no craft of any size. There are a few troops there, but, so far as I could judge by the number of fires, not more than two hundred men or so." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll try it {{one or two}} mornings, but I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{you will}} succeed. However, we can give up the plan if we find that you stay out too long. You may have five minutes' recess every day, at eleven o'clock. On the whole it shall be ten minutes. And this shall be the plan of your studies for the morning. At nine o'clock, I shall give you {{instruction}} for half an hour. Then you may study arithmetic for one hour; then write half an hour; then have a recess for ten minutes: then read {{for the rest of}} the last hour. That will bring it to twelve o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you dress}} {{her as a}} young peasant woman of the better class and {{yourself}} as a small cultivator, I will mention to my servant that I am expecting my newly married niece and her husband {{to stay with me}} for a few days. The old woman will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> I, an Irishman, would not have a Spanish niece, and indeed I do not suppose that she has any idea that I am not a Spaniard. I will open the church myself and perform the service late in the evening, so that no one will be aware of what is going on. Of course I can put up your friend too. Then you can stay quietly here as long as you like." ...|$|E
60|$|The visitor made a {{grateful}} little murmur of acquiescence, {{and sat down}} in a spot somewhat removed; so that, glancing round, I could see his gray pantaloons and dusty shoes, while his upper part was mostly hidden behind the shrubbery. Nor did he come forth from this retirement during the whole of the interview that followed. We handed him such food as we had, together with a brown jug of molasses and water (would that it had been brandy, or some thing better, {{for the sake of his}} chill old heart!), like priests offering dainty sacrifice to an enshrined and invisible idol. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he really lacked sustenance; but it was quite touching, nevertheless, to hear him nibbling away at our crusts.|$|E
