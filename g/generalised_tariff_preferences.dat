40|$|In recent debates, trade {{preference}} erosion {{has been viewed}} by some as damaging to developing countries, and by others as insignificant, except in a few cases. But little data have been available to back either view. The objective {{of this paper is}} to improve our measures of the size, utilization, and value of all U. S. nonreciprocal {{trade preference}} programs in order to shed light on this debate. Highly disaggregated data are used to quantify the margins, coverage, utilization, and value of agricultural and nonagricultural <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> for all beneficiary countries in the U. S. regional programs and in the Generalized System of Preferences. Results show that U. S. regional <b>tariff</b> <b>preference</b> programs are generally characterized by high coverage of beneficiary countries'exports, high utilization by beneficiary countries, and low <b>tariff</b> <b>preference</b> margins (except on apparel). For 29 countries, the value of U. S. <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> was 5 percent or more of 2003 dutiable exports to the United States, even after incorporating actual utilization. Most of this value is attributable to nonagricultural <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences,</b> and to apparel preferences in particular. These results suggest that preference erosion may be significant for more countries than many had thought.

40|$|The report {{examines}} EU’s tariff regime for {{seafood and}} its implications for Norway’s exports to the EU. If Norway had no <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> in the EU market, her seafood exports would be charged tariffs at 1. 3 billion NOK or 6 % of the trade value. <b>Tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> under the Norway-EU free trade agreements cut tariffs by around half, and tariff quotas imply a further reduction to 0. 4 billion or 1. 84 % of the trade value. However, most other suppliers to the EU market have <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> that are as good or even better. For Norway, WTO liberalisation will reduce tariffs for its seafood exports to the EU and provide a clear overall gain. EU membership will nevertheless eliminate tariffs altogether, and might have an impact on import demand that is 15 times larger than what is expected from the current WTO round.

40|$|With the {{signature}} of the Asuncion Treaty by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in July 1991, the four countries implemented an ambitious program to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers on their reciprocal trade; a common policy toward third countries was implemented in 1995. As MERCOSUR deepened further, intra-zone trade increased its share in total trade. In most cases, increasing intra-zone trade meant an increasing participation of goods where MERCOSUR members {{did not have a}} RCA {{at the beginning of the}} integration process. Starting from Krugman (1980) monopolistic competitive model for international trade we derive an equation to explain regional patterns of imports. Making use of a recently detailed database on intra-MERCOSUR tariffs we estimate the effect of <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> on the origin of imports of MERCOSUR members between 1991 and 2004. The results show <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> affected imports patterns in the cases of Argentina and Uruguay, and to a less extent also those of Brazil and Paraguay.

These trade <b>preferences,</b> which reduced <b>tariffs</b> and product quotas, are "nonreciprocal," meaning that beneficiaries need not reciprocate with lower tariffs for donor export countries. This report discusses (1) the volume of U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preferential trade, (2) the U.

S. and EU imports, at two percent ($ 18 billion) and six percent ($ 45 billion), respectively. The U. S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal preferential trade have evolved in similar ways since their inception in the early 1970 s. U. S. and EU programs have included increasingly more products, particularly to the poorest countries, and have, over time, relaxed customs requirements that specify where and how products can be made. Despite some program differences, the U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preference arrangements offer relatively similar <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> on average.

40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean meeting on May 15 - 16 th 2003 noted 'the uncertainties surrounding the future of the European Union's sugar policy after 2006 and that long-term stability in respect of this policy is vital for the implementation of the ACP-EU Sugar Protocol and the SPS Agreement'. Areas of uncertainty include: the outcome of the WTO challenge to the EU 'C' export system; reform of the EU sugar regime; the impact of EU enlargement; the impact of the full implementation of the EBA sugar arrangement; the outcome of the EPA negotiations. These uncertainties are affecting long-term planning and restructuring plans. The directors committed themselves to seeking the 'maintenance of the current level of <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> for African Caribbean and Pacific countries' and a 'fairly managed sugar market in the EU'. Comment: With Commissioner Fischler indicating that, for sectors not yet subject to reform, new proposals would 'follow the general lines of the present proposals', some decline in the EU sugar price appears inevitable. With tariffs being based on the difference between the EU and world market price, this is likely to result in reduced tariffs on sugar imports and hence in erosion of the <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> that ACP exports currently enjoy. For ACP suppliers this issue is more about the value of the preferences per se (how much money you will get per tonne of sugar exported under a reformed sugar regime) rather than the margin of <b>tariff</b> <b>preference.</b> While during the transitional period the EU is likely to opt for a managed sugar regime, Commissioner Fischler has indicated that ultimately the Commission would like to see sugar included in the de-coupled single farm payment system. This implies the ultimate abandonment of a managed sugar regime, possibly as early as 2009. The {{board of directors}} of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean meeting on May [...] ...|$|R
