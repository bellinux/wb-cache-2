The network provided long distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks.

50|$|On 29 December 1859 {{the newly}} {{constructed}} telegraph line {{was brought into}} use, the line was built generally alongside the Great Western Road from Sydney to Bathurst and was constructed of timber poles with one galvanised wire tied to insulators on each pole. At several intermediate points along the route a telegraph repeater station was located, including Parramatta, Penrith, Katoomba and Hartley. At the <b>intermediate</b> <b>repeater</b> stations an operator manually retyped the message, passing it through that location. The system operated on the earth return principle whereby the circuit started at a large battery at one end (end A), via a morse key used by the telegraph operator, passed along the galvanised iron wire attached to the poles, then through the morse instrument {{at the far end}} (end B) and returned to the battery (at end A) through the ground (earth). This was a cheap method of construction requiring only one wire and no pole crossarms.|$|E

We find measurement-based purification protocols with significantly improved noise thresholds. Furthermore we show that already resource states of small size suffice to significantly increase the maximal communication distance.

40|$|The {{integration}} of a satellite {{system with a}} HAPS segment appears very suitable to provide communication services, including Internet access, for a large set of applications. In fact, the-satellite capability to provide wide coverage and broadband access can be enhanced {{by the use of}} cost-effective, mobile/portable and low-power consuming user terminals, when HAPS acts as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>repeater.</b> Moreover, also TCP-based applications, which suffer from long latency introduced by the satellite link and in general by errors, can get benefits in terms of end-to-end performance. In this frame, this paper deals with the introduction, on board the HAPS, of an efficient CAC scheme in order to guarantee an optimal utilization of the precious radio resources. In particular, we propose an innovative TCP driven CAC algorithm, which shall take into account not only the QoS requirements, but also TCP statistics obtained through a proxy installed on the HAPS.

40|$|Abstract- Ad-hoc {{networks}} form instantaneously {{without the}} need of any infrastructure or centralized controller. This type of peer-to-peer system results that each node, or user, in the network {{can act as a}} data endpoint or <b>intermediate</b> <b>repeater.</b> Thus, all users work simultaneously to improve the reliability of network communications. These networks are also popularly called as "mesh networks " because the topology of network communications resembles a mesh. The redundant and the unnecessary communication paths provided by ad hoc mesh networks significantly improve the fault tolerance for the network. Also, the ability of the data packets to "hop " from one user to other effectively extends the network coverage area and provides a solution to defeat non-line of sight (LOS) issues. As mobile networking continues to experience increasing popularity; the need to connect large numbers of wireless devices will become more prevalent. Many recent proposals for ad hoc routing have certain characteristics which may limit their scalability to large networks. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes connected by wireless links forming a temporary network without the aid of any infrastructure or any centralized administration. Nodes within each other’s radio range communicate directly via wireless links, while those that are far apart use other nodes as relays in a multi-hop routing fashion. These protocols typically suffer from a number of shortcomings, such as high routing overhead and limited scalability. The scalability of current on-demand and table driven routing protocols is evaluated through the selection of a representative from the class of protocols. The performance of the un-modified on-demand protocol an...|$|E

It would be almost impossible to send 240 bytes across the cable at 5 Mbit/s without <b>intermediate</b> <b>repeaters,</b> losing more than 96 % of the packets. With ToLHnet, instead, less than 0.1 % of the packets get lost, making communication possible and quite reliable (for real, non-PING packets, the master will of course automatically retry transmissions in case of packet loss).|$|R

30|$|In the {{microwave}} communication, the synchrophasor data {{generated by the}} PMU {{is fed to a}} PMU radio terminal that converts the electrical signal into radio frequency (RF) signal. The RF signal is then fed to a microwave antenna that converts the RF signal into an electromagnetic signal. This electromagnetic signal propagates in free space and is received by {{the microwave}} antenna at the PDC. The PDC radio terminal converts the RF signal back into the electrical signal, which is sent to the PDC for analysis. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>repeaters</b> are required to maintain the signal strength and to ensure communication feasibility in the case of non-line of sight propagation. The main disadvantage of this technology is that the signal propagates in free space and hence is susceptible to cyber-physical attacks.|$|R

40|$|Conference Name: 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops, INFOCOM WKSHPS 2011. Conference Address: Shanghai, China. Time:April 10, 2011 - April 15, 2011. Molecular {{communication}} or communication {{based on}} molecules in aqueous environments often relies on free diffusion of signal molecules where a transmitter nanomachine releases signal molecules that randomly {{walk in the}} environments to reach the receiver nanomachine. Since the signal molecules randomly walk in the three dimensional environments, the number of molecules that can reach the receiver significantly decreases over distance. A challenge in molecular communication is therefore to overcome the attenuation of molecular signals over distance. In this paper, we investigate a design of repeater nanomachines that amplify signal molecules to enable molecular communication over extended distances. The repeater nanomachines are placed between a transmitter and the receiver, where signal molecules released by the transmitter are amplified by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>repeaters</b> to reach the receiver. A specific biological model and design of molecular communication are used for designing repeaters, with simulation results showing the conditions for the repeaters to amplify, signal molecules for long distance molecular communication. ? 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Society relies and depends {{increasingly}} {{on information}} exchange and communication. In the quantum world, security and privacy is a built-in feature for information processing. The essential ingredient for exploiting these quantum advantages is the resource of entanglement, {{which can be}} shared between two or more parties. The distribution of entanglement over large distances constitutes a key challenge for current research and development. Due to losses of the transmitted quantum particles, which typically scale exponentially with the distance, <b>intermediate</b> quantum <b>repeater</b> stations are needed. Here we show how to generalise the quantum repeater concept to the multipartite case, by fully describing large-scale quantum networks, i. e. network nodes and their long-distance links, {{in the language of}} graphs and graph states. This unifying approach comprises both the distribution of multipartite entanglement across the network, and the protection against errors via encoding. The correspondence to graph states also provides a tool for optimising the architecture of quantum networks.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{complete}} satellite access network solution for multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) delivery {{based on the}} T-UMTS standards. Firstly, the benefits of MBMS delivery via satellite (SAT-MBMS) for both S/T-UMTS network operators are shown via market and business analysis. A new integrated S/T-UMTS architecture for MBMS delivery is then proposed featuring an <b>intermediate</b> module <b>repeater</b> (IMR) for coverage of urban areas. The architectural options for IMR and terminal design are discussed considering the relevant cost and complexity. The IMR propagation channel conditions are investigated and a new propagation channel model is proposed. The potential of advanced coding schemes such as the layered coding technique to tackle the channel variations in broadcast / multicast environment is outlined. The functional and protocol architecture are defined along with the interface between the satellite access network and the UMTS core network. Required modifications on the terrestrial access scheme sub-layers to support MBMS data are investigated and the relevant logical, transport and physical channels are selected.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the physical layer {{performance of the}} Satellite High Speed Downlink Packet Access (S-HSDPA) system via ground based relays or <b>intermediate</b> Module <b>Repeaters</b> (IMRs). The work evaluates the modifications needed for the terrestrial HSDPA system to a satellite architecture by change of certain significant parameters within a high dispersive IMR environment to deliver high data throughput to satellite mobile terminals. Initial results for S-HSDPA with different terminal capabilities and modulation formats have been obtained. Two diversity techniques, namely receive antenna diversity and space time transmit diversity (STTD) were also investigated. The impact of {{increasing the number of}} multicodes transmission for the S-HSDPA system has also been considered. In all of these results, we have shown the capacity to be insufficient to support an economic operational system. In order to investigate improved capacity we have analyzed two advance receiver techniques using channel equalizers and multipath interference cancellers. The performances of two low complexity chip-level adaptive equalizers (CPICH NLMS equalizer and Griffiths' equalizer) equalizer) and the multipath interference canceller (MPIC) have been compared with the conventional RAKE receiver for the S-HSDPA system in an IMR environment. It has been shown that the equalizers can increase the throughput in comparison to the conventional Rake receiver while incurring minimum additional complexity. Thus it is concluded that advanced terminal receivers will be necessary in any practical satellite system. Finally, a study of the orthogonality factor (which parameterizes the intracell interference), as a crucial parameter in the calculation of downlink satellite power has been performed in the IMR environment. Results of the orthogonality factor are presented for multicode S-HSDPA transmission for simple receivers and the use of receive antenna diversity. Using the equalizer based receivers it is shown that the orthogonality factor statistics can be significantly lowered as compared to the conventional matched filter receiver...|$|R
