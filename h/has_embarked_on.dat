25|$|Since {{the legal}} {{reforms of the}} late 1970s and 1980s, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has officially moved to embrace the {{language}} {{of the rule of law}} and to establish a modern court system.

The concept of 'rule of law' has been emphasized in the constitution, and the ruling party <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> <b>on</b> campaigns to promote the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the constitution itself, in which the Communist Party insists that its authority supersedes that of the law. Thus, the constitution enshrines the rule of law, yet simultaneously stresses the principle that the 'leadership of the Communist Party' holds primacy over the law.|$|E
