25|$|Like {{almost all}} spiders, Steatoda nobilis is venomous, but its bite is almost {{exclusively}} of mild effect on humans, without the severe consequences {{that can occur}} with black widow spiders. Its bite is often alleged {{to be one of}} the medically significant for humans, even though the few recorded bites do not typically present long-lasting effects. The symptoms of a bite are typically similar to a bee or wasp sting. The bite of this spider, along with others in the genus Steatoda, can produce a set of symptoms known as steatodism. Symptoms of bites include intense pain radiating from the bite site, along with <b>feverishness</b> or general malaise. Male bites are less severe than that of the female.|$|E
2500|$|... {{one or more}} of the {{following}} symptoms: sensation of a flu-like state, extreme fatigue or exhaustion, weakness of musculature, experiences of <b>feverishness</b> or perspiration, mood disturbances and / or irritability, memory difficulties, concentration problems, incoherent speech, congestion of nose or watery nose, itching eyes; ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you come}} to see {{monsieur}} my uncle, you come inopportunely, messieurs," [...] she told them, a certain <b>feverishness</b> in her air. [...] "He is closely--oh, so very closely--engaged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you that the {{situation}} was quite dramatic," [...] continued the man in the corner, whilst his funny, claw-like hands took up a bit of string with renewed <b>feverishness.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{now for the}} letter," [...] {{concluded}} Heron {{with the}} same marked <b>feverishness</b> of manner which sat so curiously on his uncouth personality. [...] "Pen, ink and paper, sergeant!" [...] he commanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} walking fast, {{in order to}} get here quickly," [...] she thought. How could she know that he had just crawled out from the straw of the shelter hard by; and that the heat of his hand was <b>feverishness?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{threw his}} arm familiarly round the supple, stayless little waist, accented {{only by the}} belt of the light flounced saya, and said, [...] "But why this haste and <b>feverishness,</b> 'Nita? And now I look at thee, thou hast been crying." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} in those months my reason wandered a little under all this strain; and I think to-day that the long ecstasies into which I fell were largely {{the result of a}} <b>feverishness</b> that burned in me as a {{consequence}} of a chill that I had taken.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it," [...] said the now excited Mexican. [...] "You shall have it of us,--the four! You shall {{come to our}} camp and shall melt it,--and show the silver, and--enough! Come!" [...] and in his <b>feverishness</b> he {{clutched}} the hand of his companion as if to lead him forth at once.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh--I forgot!' faltered Betty. And {{then she}} {{informed}} him that, on hearing of her husband's approach the week before, {{in a desperate}} attempt to keep him from her side, she had tried to imbibe the infection--an act which till this moment she had supposed to have been ineffectual, imagining her <b>feverishness</b> to be the result of her excitement.|$|E
60|$|He {{was glad}} he had thrashed that brute. The {{physical}} exertion had left his body in a comfortable glow. His mental agitation too was clarified {{as if all the}} <b>feverishness</b> had gone out of him in a fit of outward violence. Together with the persisting sense of terrible danger he was conscious now of a tranquil, unquenchable hate.|$|E
60|$|If she had {{not been}} out at lunch-time, he would have lunched out himself--afraid of his own face. For <b>feverishness</b> in sick persons mounts {{steadily}} with the approach of a certain hour. And surely his face, to anyone who could have seen him being conveyed to Piccadilly, would have suggested a fevered invalid rather than a healthy, middle-aged sculptor in a cab.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad grammar, Sir!" [...] {{his father}} remarked with some sternness. [...] "Kindly attend to that little matter, Professor, {{as soon as}} you have {{corrected}} the <b>feverishness.</b> And, by the way, Professor!" [...] (The Professor left his distinguished pupil standing at the door, and meekly returned.) [...] "There is a rumour afloat, that the people wish to elect an--in point of fact, an --you understand that I mean an--" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{only then}} did Averil know the full misery that Henry's {{decision}} had inflicted on the gentle little heart, in childish ignorance, imagining fetters and dungeons, even in her sober waking moods, and a prey to untold horrors in every dream, exaggerated by <b>feverishness</b> and ailment--horrors that, for aught she knew, might be veritable, and made more awful by the treatment of his name as that of one dead.|$|E
60|$|She {{soon came}} out of that attack, but was {{exceedingly}} ill all that night and the next day, her recovery being altogether thrown back by <b>feverishness</b> and loss of appetite; but, strange child that she was, she never named Harold, nor let me speak of him. I think she instinctively shrank from her own emotion, and had a kind of dread and jealous horror of seeing anyone else grieve for him.|$|E
60|$|Sir Marmaduke {{modified}} {{his disappointment}} a little that night, {{when he had}} talked Philip {{into a state of}} <b>feverishness</b> and suffering that became worse under Madame de Quinet's reproofs and remedies, and only yielded to Eustacie's long and patient soothing. He then could almost have owned that it was well she was not like his own cherished type of womanhood, and the next day he changed his opinion still more, even as to her appearance.|$|E
60|$|Averil was {{somewhat}} better; the <b>feverishness</b> {{had been removed}} by her long sleep of despair, and her energy revived under the bodily relief, and the fixed purpose of recovering {{in time to see}} her brother again; but the improvement was not yet trusted by Henry, who feared her doing too much unless he was himself watching over her, and therefore only paid Leonard a short visit in the forenoon, going and returning by early trains.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had never}} been wont to think seriously of colds {{but when it came}} to {{coughing}} and <b>feverishness</b> all night, and Arthur, with his hand on his chest, persisted that it was all in his throat and told her to send for a blister, she grew alarmed, but this only displeased him. He disdained her entreaty that he would remain in bed; and said women always made a fuss about nothing, when she timidly suggested sending for 'some one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{answered}} his dragoman, [...] "for it is 'The Messiah' in ragtime. No time is wasted, you notice; all, even pleasure, is intensively cultivated, {{on the lines}} of least resistance, thanks to the <b>feverishness</b> engendered in us by the Great Skirmish, when no one knew {{if he would have}} another chance, and to the subsequent need for fostering industry. But whether we really enjoy ourselves is perhaps a question to answer which you must examine the English character." ...|$|E
60|$|The others {{remained}} with their preparations, {{and with such}} consolation as the exceeding sympathy and kindness of the whole town could afford them. Their mother remained in the same state, except when roused by an effort; {{and then there was}} an attention and presence of mind about her that gave anxiety lest excitement should be bringing <b>feverishness,</b> but she always fell back into her usual state of silence, such that it could be hardly told whether it were torpid or not.|$|E
60|$|Their {{dinner was}} brought in, but Fernando had no appetite. He soon {{returned}} to his chess player, {{and seemed to be}} playing over the game, but he was too much tired for talk, and soon went to bed; where after a short sleep <b>feverishness</b> set in, bringing something approaching to delirium. The nurse had gone a fortnight previously; but as he was still too helpless to have no one within call, Felix slept on the bed {{in the corner of the}} room.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this way}} Goldsmith went on [...] "outrunning the constable," [...] as he termed it; {{spending}} everything in advance; {{working with an}} overtasked head and weary heart to pay for past pleasures and past extravagance, {{and at the same}} time incurring new debts, to perpetuate his struggles and darken his future prospects. While the excitement of society and the excitement of composition conspire to keep up a <b>feverishness</b> of the system, he has incurred an unfortunate habit of quacking himself with James' powders, a fashionable panacea of the day.|$|E
6000|$|Little good {{did their}} truth-telling do them. At nine o'clock the guards, paid bravoes of the smug {{citizens}} who constitute the state, full {{of meat and}} sleep, were upon us. Not only had we had no breakfast, but we had had no water. And beaten men are prone to <b>feverishness.</b> I wonder, my reader, if you can glimpse or guess the faintest connotation of a man beaten--"beat up," [...] we prisoners call it. But no, I shall not tell you. Let it suffice to know that these beaten, feverish men lay seven hours without water.|$|E
6000|$|Things somehow seemed {{brighter}} {{when they}} {{walked down to the}} club together. Dress makes so much difference to a man, and Arthur, spruce and debonair, with a gardenia in his button-hole, and every part of his attire almost [...] "faultily faultless," [...] according to the canons of London fashion, presented a very different appearance to the tragical-looking personage of half an hour ago. There was a slight air of subdued <b>feverishness</b> about him, though, not altogether healthy, and the dark rims had not quite vanished from underneath his eyes.|$|E
60|$|To {{tell him}} she was Cousin Annaple, Billy's mamma, had no effect; {{he did not seem}} able to understand, and she could only retire--nurse being thus {{convinced}} that to let him see another stranger to-night would only do further harm. Nuttie and nurse succeeded in reassuring him that he was safe at home and with them, and in hushing him off into what they hoped would be a quiet wholesome sleep in spite of the hot sultry night, on which Annaple laid {{a good deal of the}} blame of his restlessness and <b>feverishness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Alick had not {{forgotten}} her original views as to travelling, {{and as they}} were eventually to go to Scotland, had proposed beginning with Dutch reformatories and Swiss cretins; {{but she was so}} plainly unfit for extra fatigue and bustle, that the first few weeks were to be spent in Wales, where the enjoyment of fine scenery might, it was hoped, be beneficial to the jaded spirits, and they had been going through a course of passes and glens as thoroughly as Rachel's powers would permit, for any over-fatigue renewed <b>feverishness</b> and its delusive miseries, and the slightest alarm told upon the shattered nerves.|$|E
60|$|Chauvelin and Martin-Roget {{turned from}} the quay on to the Petite Hollande--the great open ground with its {{converging}} row of trees which ends at the very apex of the Isle of Feydeau. Opposite to them at the further corner of the Place was the Hôtel de la Villestreux. One {{or two of the}} windows in the hotel were lighted from within. No doubt the proconsul was awake, trembling in the remotest angle of his lair, with the spectre of assassination rampant before him--aroused by the continued disturbance of the night, by the <b>feverishness</b> of this man-hunt carried on almost at his gates.|$|E
60|$|The Devil acceded to his request, bowed, and withdrew. Alighting {{gracefully}} in Montgomery Street, {{he dropped}} into Meade & Co.'s clothing store, where, having completely equipped himself a la mode, he sallied forth intent {{on his personal}} enjoyment. Determining to sink his professional character, he mingled with the current of human life, and enjoyed, with that immense capacity for excitement peculiar to his nature, the whirl, bustle, and <b>feverishness</b> of the people, as a purely aesthetic gratification unalloyed by the cares of business. What he did that evening {{does not belong to}} our story. We return to the broker, whom we left on the roof.|$|E
60|$|I {{never could}} tell {{whether he had}} confounded it with electro-galvanism, or was only satirizing our American haste and <b>feverishness.</b> He was capable of either. For that matter, {{we knew that the}} Chinese {{themselves}} possessed some means of secretly and quickly communicating with one another. Any news of good or ill import to their race was quickly disseminated through the settlement before WE knew anything about it. An innocent basket of clothes from the wash, sent up from the river-bank, became in some way a library of information; a single slip of rice-paper, aimlessly fluttering in the dust of the road, had the mysterious effect of diverging a whole gang of coolie tramps away from our settlement.|$|E
60|$|He {{was soon}} able {{to resume the}} hours of the family, but was still far from well; {{suffering}} from languor, pain in the head, want of sleep and appetite; and an evening <b>feverishness.</b> He was unequal to deep reading, and was in no frame for light books; he could not walk far, and his sister's literary coteries, which he had always despised, were at present beyond his powers of endurance. She hoped that society would divert his thoughts and raise his spirits, and arranged her parties {{with a view to}} him; but he never could stay long in the room, and Dr. Henley, who, though proud of his wife and her talents, had little pleasure in her learned circle, used to aid and abet his escape.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{it would}} not be well to conjure up too heroic an image of Italian revolutionary society: we know what vices fester and passions rage in war-time, and Italy was then almost {{constantly}} involved in war. Intellectually, men are active, but the great poems are not written in war-time, nor the highest effects of civilization produced. There is a taint of insanity and of instability in everything, a mark of <b>feverishness</b> and haste and transition. The revolution gave Italy a chance for new life, but this was the most the revolution could do. It was a great gift, not a perfect one; and as it remained for the Italians to improve the opportunity, they did it partially, fitfully, as men do everything.|$|E
60|$|This staying shows us, That he {{exercised}} patience, waiting God's leisure {{till the}} flood {{should be taken}} away. This grace therefore had yet seven day's work to do, before he obtained any further testimony that the waters were decreasing. O this staying work is hard work! Alas! sometimes patience is accompanied with so much heat and <b>feverishness,</b> that every hour seems seven {{until the end of}} the trial, and the blessing promised be possessed by the waiting soul. It may be Noah might not be altogether herein a stranger: I am sure the Psalmist was not, in that he often under affliction, cries, But how long, O Lord! for ever! (Psa 6:3; 79:5; 13:1; 74:1; 89:46). Make haste! O Lord, how long! (90:13; 94:3).|$|E
60|$|So, having once {{convinced}} {{herself that}} even if Nuttie had been a consenting party, no amount of cold water and eau-de-cologne would bring those bloodshot eyes, swollen lids, and mottled cheeks to be fit to be seen, she fled {{as fast as possible}} from the gasps of barbed reproaches which put her own composure in peril, and dressed with the heaviest of hearts, coupled with the utmost solicitude to look her best. If she had not thought it absolutely wrong, she would even have followed Martin's suggestion, and put on a soupcon of rouge; but {{by the time she was}} summoned to the carriage the <b>feverishness</b> of her effort at self-control had done the work, and her husband had paid her the compliment of observing that she looked pretty enough for two.|$|E
60|$|And then {{he asked}} for the Midnight Office; and {{afterwards}} came fitful sleep, half dreamy, half broken by the wanderings of slight <b>feverishness</b> and great weakness; but she thought her attendance would not be very brief, and agreed mentally with what Mr. Audley had told her, that the doctor said that the end might yet be many weeks away. When in the dark winter's mornings the wife crept back again to her post, and all {{that could be done}} in those early hours had been effected, Sister Constance went to the half-past seven o'clock service with Felix and Clement, imparting to them on the road that the Superior of St. Faith's was expecting to receive some of the least {{of the children in the}} course of the day, to remain there for the present.|$|E
60|$|A rising wind, {{which had}} rocked the boat {{for the last}} few hours, had now {{developed}} into a strong sou'wester, with torrents of rain which swept the roadway. His well-worn working clothes, fitted to the warmer Southern mines, gave him more concern from their visible, absurd contrast to the climate than from any actual sense of discomfort, and his <b>feverishness</b> defied the chill of his soaking garments, as he hurriedly faced the blast through the dimly lighted street. At the next corner he paused; he had reached another, and, from its dilapidated appearance, apparently an older wharf than that where he had landed, but, like the first, it was still a straggling avenue leading toward the higher and more animated part of the city. He again mechanically--for a part of his trouble was a vague, undefined purpose--turned toward it.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a warm}} night. The {{cool breeze}} which usually sprang up with the going down of the sun behind the chaparral-crested {{mountain}} was that evening withheld from Sandy Bar. The little canyon was stifling with heated resinous odors, and the decaying driftwood on the Bar sent forth faint, sickening exhalations. The <b>feverishness</b> of day, and its fierce passions, still filled the camp. Lights moved restlessly along {{the bank of the}} river, striking no answering reflection from its tawny current. Against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft above the express office stood out staringly bright; and through their curtainless panes the loungers below could see the forms of those who were even then deciding the fate of Tennessee. And above all this, etched on the dark firmament, rose the Sierra, remote and passionless, crowned with remoter passionless stars.|$|E
