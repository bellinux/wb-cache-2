40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{identify}} the main socioeconomic characteristics of farmers belonging to farm cooperatives compared to those of nonmembers. The research was conducted in Qassim, an agricultural area located in the Central Region of Saudi Arabia. The sample includes 83 cooperatives members, besides 136 nonmembers. Belonging or not belonging to the cooperative served as the basis for comparison. Contingency tables and discriminant analysis are used to make the necessary comparisons. Results show that members are middle-aged more often than are nonmembers. Also members are morc educated than nonmembers. Finally, members report higher <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> than do nonmembers. Farm characteristics also distinguish members from nonmembers.

5000|$|Relative <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> {{had been}} falling for decades. The AAA {{included}} reworkings of many long-touted programs for agrarian relief, {{which had been}} demanded for decades. The most important provision of the AAA was the provision for crop reductions—the [...] "domestic allotment" [...] system, which was intended to raise prices for farm commodities by preventing surpluses from flooding the market and depressing prices further. The most controversial component of the system was the destruction in summer 1933 of growing crops and newborn livestock that exceeded the allotments. They had to be destroyed to get the plan working. However, <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> increased by half {{in the first three}} years of the New Deal and the relative position of farmers improved significantly for the first time in twenty years. Urban food prices went up slightly, because the cost of the grains was only a small fraction of what the consumer paid. Conditions improved for the great majority of commercial farmers by 1936. The <b>income</b> of the <b>farm</b> sector almost doubled from $4.5 billion in 1932 to $8.9 billion in 1941 just before the war.

50|$|The first {{sector of}} the economy that was hit by a fall in post-war demand was agriculture. During World War I, the American {{agricultural}} industry enjoyed prosperity, through the raising of prices which led to increased output which Americans used to supply Europe. Farmers borrowed heavily to expand their acreage; they had difficulty paying back the loans when prices fell. Some of the post war problems for the American agriculture come from the great surplus of farm goods that could not be absorbed in the national market, because European countries had recovered sufficiently from the war, and their markets no longer required large quantities of American agricultural products. <b>Gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> in 1919 amounted to $17.7 billion. By 1921, exports to Europe had plummeted and farm income fell to $10.5 billion. Other sectors of the economy wanted to avoid a similar fate. The 1920 election put the conservative pro-business and pro-farm Republicans in control of Congress and the White House.|$|E
40|$|Although {{exporting}} {{agricultural products}} {{has become an}} important means of reducing stockpiles in the United States, few studies have assessed the farmers 2 ̆ 7 views {{of international trade and}} foreign policies which affect these exports. By analyzing questionnaires returned by a sample of 649 Nebraska farmers and ranchers, this dissertation attempts to close the current research gap. In order to understand variations of attitudes within the group of agricultural producers, their economic interest (production of heavily exported commodities and high <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>income)</b> is weighed as an independent variable against more commonly cited determinants of world view such as education, partisanship, group membership, and age. The general hypothesis is that the production of heavily exported commodities correlates with a more internationalist perspective. ^ Primary findings are: (1) Higher <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> is correlated with the belief that more exports mean greater profits. (2) Older respondents {{are more likely to be}} interested in world news. (3) Farmer/ranchers with more education, Republican Party affiliation, higher <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>income,</b> and more interest in world news are most likely to support an active role for the U. S. in the world. (4) Foreign policy goals with a humanitarian emphasis are supported by those who expect more profits from increased exports, as well as by older, more liberal agricultural producers and those favoring an active role for the U. S. in the world. (5) More militaristic foreign policy goals are correlated with Republican Party affiliation, lower education levels, interest in world news, and support for U.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} attitudes and behaviors of Iowa farmers toward wildlife. Based on a 1991 statewide mailed survey of 822 farmers, it divides Iowa farmers into 2 ̆ 2 wildlife-oriented 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 non-wildlife-oriented 2 ̆ 2 groups for sampling and analysis. It identifies demographic and personal factors that are correlated with a wildlife orientation. Wildlife-oriented farmers in Iowa tend to be farmers with smaller acreages overall, with smaller <b>gross</b> <b>farm</b> <b>incomes,</b> with fewer acres devoted to row-crops, and with more diverse landscapes that more often include trees, streams, Conservation Reserve Program acres or other non-agricultural land than farmers who are not wildlife-oriented.

In this research, we employ a survey of direct- and niche-marketing farmers located in the RUF of Vancouver, Canada to examine how the rural-urban interface affects farms, particularly their long-term survivability and sustainability. From a list of 102 direct marketing and organic farmers, we managed to elicit twenty-nine completed surveys.
