This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user.Snaps themselves have no dependency on any <b>external</b> <b>store</b> ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on Ubuntu and other versions of Linux, the Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well.|$|E

In most of them, each register {{can hold a}} natural number (of unlimited size), and the instructions are simple (and few in number), e.g. only decrementation (combined with conditional jump) and incrementation exist (and halting). The lack of the infinite (or dynamically growing) <b>external</b> <b>store</b> (seen at Turing machines) can be understood by replacing its role with Gödel numbering techniques: the fact that each register holds a natural number allows the possibility of representing a complicated thing (e.g. a sequence, or a matrix etc.) by an appropriate huge natural number — unambiguity of both representation and interpretation can be established by number theoretical foundations of these techniques.|$|E

The term ripple {{applies to the}} single- or ripple and single- continuous release mode from one or from mirror stations. Salvo release mode applies {{to a combination of}} several stations together e.g. adjacent stations. For multiple store release an interval timer can be set to release stores in fixed time steps. For an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> emergency release there is for example a panic button in the F-4 Phantom II, a feature found on all naval aircraft in case an engine or catapult fails during launch; in such cases, a pilot can press the [...] "panic button", and jettison all stores, reducing weight and hopefully allowing the aircraft to avoid hitting the sea, and to climb away to decide on further action. Land-based aircraft often have a similar feature, for similar reasons, although the situation is generally not quite as critical as a failure during a catapult launch.|$|E
50|$|The more traditional, fixed bomb rack, a {{conventional}} bomb rack {{like that of}} the B-52 would have mounted stores in vertical columns making individual store selection and release impossible without releasing all stores ahead in the column line. The advantage of {{a conventional}} bomb rack is a prompt release of all stores in short order.Bombers like the B-52, the B-1 or the B-2 use custom designed bomb rack support structures with their own designation e.g. Common Bomb Rack (CBR), Common Bomb Module (CBM), or Smart Bomb Rack Assembly (SBRA). These bomb racks may have special store release control mechanisms. Aside from the release options of a rack a pilot can select release mode for releasing one or multiple stores. Stores can be jettisoned selectively in single mode or ripple mode or salvo mode. The term ripple applies to the single- or ripple and single- continuous release mode from one or from mirror stations. Salvo release mode applies to a combination of several stations together e.g. adjacent stations. For multiple store release an interval timer can be set to release stores in fixed time steps. For an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> emergency release there may be a panic button to release all of the weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The Bronco started flying {{midway through}} the Charger's test program on 16 July 1965, {{and became one of}} the premier {{counter-insurgency}} (COIN) aircraft of the next 30 years. It did not achieve Rice's L2 VMA concept because the DoD insisted on 40 ft long wings which made it depend on airbases. Rice concludes: [...] "The original concept of a small, simple aircraft that could operate close to the supported troops had been almost completely eviscerated by the 'system.' The ability to operate from roads (20 ft span and 6.5 tread) had been ignored, and performance compromised by the short 30 ft span, the extra 1,000 lb for the rough field landing gear and another 1,000 lb of electronics. The 'light, simple' airplane also had a full complement of instruments, ejection seats and seven <b>external</b> <b>store</b> stations. The concept of using ground ordnance and a bomb bay had been ignored, although it did have provisions for four M60 medium machine guns. In spite of this growth (almost double the size and weight of our home built), the YOV-10 still had great potential. It would not achieve the advantages of integration with the ground scheme of maneuver, but it did have capabilities {{at the low end of}} the performance envelope that were still valuable and unique." ...|$|E

40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the Langley 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel on a 0. 182 -scale model of an F 4 U- 1 {{airplane}} with <b>external</b> <b>stores.</b> This paper is concerned mainly with presenting the data obtained in this investigation and with a comparison of some of these data with flight-test results determining the feasibility of estimating flight buffet Mach number from tunnel data. The results of this investigation indicate that the incremental drag coefficient due to <b>external</b> <b>stores</b> may be used to estimate the maximum Mach number that the F 4 U- 1 airplane may reach in flight when it is equipped with <b>external</b> <b>stores.</b> This estimation is conservative for the five configurations investigated by mounts varying from 0 to 10 percent of the flight limit Mach number. The free-stream tunnel Mach number corresponding to sonic flow over the lower surface of the wing in the region of the store is a good indication of the lower limit of buffet in flight of the F 4 U- 1 airplane when equipped with <b>external</b> <b>stores.</b> The fluctuations of total pressure over the horizontal tail are not sufficiently large (maximum of 1 percent q(sub o) to cause buffeting of the airplane...|$|R

40|$|A {{coupling}} {{method for}} efficient vibration mode analysis of aircraft with multiple <b>external</b> <b>store</b> configurations is presented. A set of low-frequency vibration modes, including rigid-body modes, represent the aircraft. Each <b>external</b> <b>store</b> {{is represented by}} its vibration modes with clamped boundary conditions, and by its rigid-body inertial properties. The aircraft modes are obtained from a finite-element model loaded by dummy rigid external stores with fictitious masses. The coupling procedure unloads the dummy stores and loads the actual stores instead. The analytical development is presented, {{the effects of the}} fictitious mass magnitudes are discussed, and a numerical example is given for a combat aircraft with external wing stores. Comparison with vibration modes obtained by a direct (full-size) eigensolution shows very accurate coupling results. Once the aircraft and stores data bases are constructed, the computer time for analyzing any <b>external</b> <b>store</b> configuration is two to three orders of magnitude less than that of a direct solution...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is to study the effect of an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> on a subsonic fighter aircraft. Generally most modern fighter aircrafts are designed with an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> installation. In this study, a subsonic fighter aircraft model has been manufactured using a computer numerical control machine {{for the purpose of}} studying the effect of the aerodynamic interference of the <b>external</b> <b>store</b> on the flow around the aircraft wing. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation was also carried out on the same configuration. Both the CFD and the wind tunnel testing were carried out at a Reynolds number 1. 86 × 10 5 to ensure that the aerodynamic characteristic can certify that the aircraft will not be face any difficulties in its stability and controllability. Both the experiments and the simulation were carried out at the same Reynolds number in order to verify each other. In the CFD simulation, a commercial CFD code was used to simulate the interference and aerodynamic characteristics of the model. Subsequently, the model together with an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> was tested in a low speed wind tunnel with a test section sized 0. 45 m× 0. 45 m. Measured and computed results for the two-dimensional pressure distribution were satisfactorily comparable. There is only a 19 % deviation between pressure distribution measured in wind tunnel testing and the result predicted by the CFD. The result shows that the effect of the external storage is only significant on the lower surface of the wing and almost negligible on the upper surface of the wing. Aerodynamic interference due to the <b>external</b> <b>store</b> was most evident on the lower surface of the wing and almost negligible on the upper surface at a low angle of attack. In addition, the area of influence on the wing surface by the store interference increased as the airspeed increased...|$|E
