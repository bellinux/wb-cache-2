40|$|Feedforward {{inhibition}} {{controls the}} time window for synaptic integration and ensures temporal precision in cortical circuits. There is little information whether feedforward inhibition affects neurons uniformly, {{or whether it}} contributes to computational refinement within the dendritic tree. Here we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition crucially shapes the integration of synaptic signals in pyramidal cell dendrites. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging we studied the transmembrane voltage patterns in CA 1 pyramidal neurons after Schaffer collateral stimulation in acute brain slices from mice. We observed {{a high degree of}} variability in the excitation-inhibition ratio between different branches of the dendritic tree. Many dendritic segments showed no <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal</b> at all, especially the basal dendrites that received predominantly inhibitory signals. Application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline resulted in the spread of <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> throughout the dendritic tree. Tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs induced significant alterations in the patterns of excitation/inhibition, indicating that they are modified by synaptic plasticity. In summary, we show that feedforward inhibition restricts the occurrence of <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> within the dendritic tree of CA 1 pyramidal neurons and thus refines signal integration spatially...|$|R
30|$|The {{electrical}} synapse {{transmission is}} rapid and stereotyped and is mainly {{used to send}} simple <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> for systems requiring the fastest possible response. At the location of an electrical synapse, the separation between two neurons is very small (≈ 3.5 nm). This narrow gap is bridged by the gap junction channels, specialized protein structures that conduct the flow of ionic current from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell (see, e.g. [24]).|$|R
50|$|Dendrodendritic synapses are {{connections}} between the dendrites of two different neurons. This {{is in contrast to}} the more common axodendritic synapse (chemical synapse) where the axon sends signals and the dendrite receives them. Dendrodendritic synapses are activated in a similar fashion to axodendritic synapses in respects to using a chemical synapse. These chemical synapses receive a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal</b> from an incoming action potential which results in an influx of calcium ions that permit release of Neurotransmitters to propagate the signal the post synaptic cell. There is also evidence of bi-directionality in signaling at dendrodendritic synapses. Ordinarily, one of the dendrites will display inhibitory effects while the other will display excitatory effects. The actual signaling mechanism utilizes Na+ and Ca2+ pumps in a similar manner to those found in axodendritic synapses.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{research}} activity performed during my Ph. D., I investigated an all-optical fiber-based device for the ultra-fast {{control of the}} polarization of optical signals. Such a device {{is thought to be}} implemented within the transparent all-optical networks of future generation. Within these networks, the processing and the regeneration of the signal will be performed in the optical domain, as opposed to the current optical networks where the processing/regeneration is performed in the electrical domain, thus providing an increase in the processing speed and in the overall network bandwidth. Among the different polarization controller devices that can be taken in consideration (e. g., ideal polarizer, polarizer based on photorefractive materials, active polarizer, etc.), I focused my attention on the (fiber-based) nonlinear lossless polarizer (NLP), that is the most recently investigated technology, with experimental demonstration appearing only few years ago (2008). Since the NLP allows to perform a fast control of the polarization, while preserving the signal intensity, it represents a promising solution to be employed in transparent all-optical networks of future generation. In my Ph. D., I investigated the original counter-propagating configuration of the NLP and I contributed massively to the introduction of the co-propagating configuration, which has been proved to be more flexible and power efficient. Moreover, based on the NLP, I proposed a novel all-optical noise cleaning device able to almost double the optical signal-to-noise ratio of a (possibly <b>depolarized)</b> <b>signal</b> affected by unpolarized additive noise...|$|E
40|$|Polarization effects such as polarization-mode {{dispersion}} (PMD) and polarization-dependent loss (PDL) cause {{a variety}} of impairments to optical fiber communication systems. PMD induces pulse distortions and depolarization of the signal that degrade system performance. PDL can cause initially unpolarized noise become partially polarized and thus increases the system performance variation. When combined together, they can produce surprising effects that cannot be predicted by their effects acting alone.; In this dissertation, my colleagues and I derived a formula for the variance of the received electric current of a <b>depolarized</b> <b>signal</b> due to first-order PMD and partially polarized noise. From this formula and the formulae for {{the mean of the}} received electric current, we were able to calculate the system performance, e. g. the Q-factor due to the combined effect of PMD and PDL. We validated the formula by comparing Q-factors obtained from the theory, Monte Carlo simulations and experiments and found good agreements. We also found that the partially polarized noise can induce large system performance variation when the signal is depolarized. This finding is the same as when the signal is polarized. However, the beating between the signal and the noise is totally different when the signal is polarized or depolarized. In systems where the signal is depolarized, the angle between the SOP of the signal and the polarized part of the noise varies as a function of time within each bit window, while the angle is constant in systems where the signal is polarized. As a result, the beating between the signal and the noise varies over time within each bit window when the signal is depolarized and this can cause complications in determining the clock time.; In addition to the validation of the model, we also investigated the sensitivity of the Q-factor to the inherent measurement uncertainty of the pulse width of the signal, the OSNR, and the receiver filter bandwidths. This study is especially important to experimentalists and system designers to estimate the level of uncertainty of system performance in practical systems. Our model can be used in On-Off-Keyed systems where first-order PMD and PDL cause significant penalties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Taste bud cells {{transmit}} {{information regarding}} the contents of food from taste receptors embedded in apical microvilli to gustatory nerve fibers innervating basolateral membranes. In particular, taste cells depolarize, activate voltage-gated sodium channels, and fire action potentials in response to tastants. Initial cell depolarization is attributable to sodium influx through TRPM 5 in sweet, bitter, and umami cells and an undetermined cation influx through an ion channel in sour cells expressing PKD 2 L 1, a candidate sour taste receptor. The molecular identity of the voltage-gated sodium channels that sense <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> and subsequently initiate action potentials coding taste information to gustatory nerve fibers is unknown. Results We describe the molecular and histological expression profiles of cation channels involved in electrical signal transmission from apical to basolateral membrane domains. TRPM 5 was positioned immediately beneath tight junctions to receive calcium signals originating from sweet, bitter, and umami receptor activation, while PKD 2 L 1 was positioned at the taste pore. Using mouse taste bud and lingual epithelial cells collected by laser capture microdissection, SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A, and SCN 9 A voltage-gated sodium channel transcripts were expressed in taste tissue. SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A, and SCN 9 A were expressed beneath tight junctions in subsets of taste cells. SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A were expressed in TRPM 5 cells, while SCN 2 A was expressed in TRPM 5 and PKD 2 L 1 cells. HCN 4, a gene previously implicated in sour taste, was expressed in PKD 2 L 1 cells and localized to cell processes beneath the taste pore. Conclusion SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A voltage-gated sodium channels are positioned to sense initial <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> stemming from taste receptor activation and initiate taste cell action potentials. SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A gene products likely account for the tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents in taste receptor cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} channel sounding {{technique has}} been used to investigate the cross-polarization of electromagnetic waves in the 5 - 6 GHz band. Experiments were performed in two non-line-of-sight indoor locations, and it was found that there is a strong dependency of the cross-polarization of multipath components on the elevation angle-of-arrival. For a vertically polarized transmitting antenna, clusters of co-polarized multipath components were confined predominantly to the region around the horizontal plane that contains the virtual line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver. In contrast, cross-polarized signals were detected for a variety of elevation angles with considerable power levels. The surroundings of the receiver were identified as the principal source of <b>depolarized</b> <b>signals.</b> In addition, time dispersion analysis of the multipath signals led to the determination of the AoAs where there is a strong correspondence between co- and cross-polarized signals {{as a consequence of the}} partial depolarization of MPCs. This work supports the exploitation of the joint space and polarization diversities in indoor propagation scenarios to improve the system performance...|$|R
50|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the hearts pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body.|$|R
50|$|T-type calcium {{channels}} are low-voltage activated calcium channels that open during membrane depolarization. These channels aid in mediating calcium influx into cells after an action potential or <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal.</b> The entry of calcium into various cells has many different physiological responses associated with it. Within cardiac and smooth muscle cells voltage-gated calcium channel activation initiates contraction directly {{by allowing the}} cytosolic concentration to increase. Not only are T-type calcium channels known to be present within cardiac and smooth muscle, but also are present in many neuronal cells within the central nervous system. Different experimental studies within the 1970s allowed for the distinction of T-type calcium channels (transient opening calcium channels) from the already well-known L-type calcium channels (Long-Lasting calcium channels). The new T-type channels were {{much different from the}} L-type calcium channels due to their ability to be activated by more negative membrane potentials, had small single channel conductance, and also were unresponsive to calcium antagonist drugs that were present. These distinct calcium {{channels are}} generally located within the brain, peripheral nervous system, heart, smooth muscle, bone, and endocrine system.|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{the state}} of {{polarization}} of a light beam of an optical fiber is of crucial importance. Non-Linear Polarization Pulling (NLPP) is an all-optical way to control {{the state of}} polarization of signals which has been proposed in recent years. Polarization attraction effect enables to align a generic input State of Polarization (SOP) towards a fixed one. NLPP can be induced by various nonlinear effects occurring in optical fibers, in particular by the Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS). This Thesis is propaedeutic for experiments investigating NLPP. In fact, any experiment on SRS polarization pulling needs a proper polarimeter which can analyze the signals in the wavelength range from 1550 nm to 1640 nm. It is therefore necessary to employ a suitable polarimetric technique which should also give information on the spectral composition of the signals, mainly to estimate the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) due to the SRS. This polarimeter is tested and characterized in experimental tests performed during this Thesis. Moreover, {{there is also the}} necessity to generate <b>depolarized</b> <b>signals</b> to verify the repolarization capability of the NLPP effect. To meet this need, two different polarization scramblers have been employed and systematically tested to characterize the generated polarization scrambled signal...|$|R
40|$|The role of K+ {{channels}} and membrane potential in myoblast fusion was evaluated by examining resting membrane potential {{and timing of}} expression of K+ currents at three stages of differentiation of human myogenic cells: undifferentiated myoblasts, fusion-competent myoblasts (FCMBs), and freshly formed myotubes. Two K+ currents contribute to a hyperpolarization of myoblasts prior to fusion: IK(NI), a non-inactivating delayed rectifier, and IK(IR), an inward rectifier. IK(NI) density is low in undifferentiated myoblasts, increases in FCMBs and declines in myotubes. On the other hand, IK(IR) is expressed in 28 % of the FCMBs and in all myotubes. IK(IR) is reversibly blocked by Ba 2 + or Cs+. Cells expressing IK(IR) have resting membrane potentials of − 65 mV. A block by Ba 2 + or Cs+ induces a depolarization to a voltage determined by IK(NI) (− 32 mV). Cs+ and Ba 2 + ions reduce myoblast fusion. It is hypothesized that the IK(IR) -mediated hyperpolarization allows FCMBs to recruit Na+, K+ and T-type Ca 2 + channels which are present in these cells and would otherwise be inactivated. FCMBs, rendered thereby capable of firing action potentials, could amplify <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> and may accelerate fusion...|$|R
50|$|In {{patients}} with these the channel {{is unable to}} inactivate, sodium conductance is sustained and the muscle remains permanently tense. Since the motor end plate is <b>depolarized,</b> further <b>signals</b> to contract have no effect (paralysis). The condition is hyperkalemic because a high extracellular potassium ion concentration will make it even more unfavourable for potassium to leave the cell in order to repolarise it to the resting potential, and this further prolongs the sodium conductance and keeps the muscle contracted. Hence, the severity would be reduced if extracellular (serum) potassium ion concentrations are kept low.|$|R
40|$|The {{lattice-like}} {{structure of}} the cerebellar cortex and its anatomical organization in two perpendicular axes provided the foundations for many theories of cerebellar function. However, the functional organization does not always match the anatomical organization. Thus direct measurement of the functional organization is central {{to our understanding of}} cerebellar processing. Here we use voltage sensitive dye imaging in the isolated cerebellar preparation to characterize the spatio-temporal organization of the climbing and mossy fiber (MF) inputs to the cerebellar cortex. Spatial and temporal parameters were used to develop reliable criteria to distinguish climbing fiber (CF) responses from MF responses. CF activation excited postsynaptic neurons along a parasagittal cortical band. These responses were composed of slow (~ 25 ms), monophasic <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals.</b> Neither the duration nor the spatial distribution of CF responses were affected by inhibition. Activation of MF generated responses that were organized in radial patches, and were composed of a fast (~ 5 ms) depolarizing phase followed by a prolonged (~ 100 ms) negative wave. Application of a GABA A blocker eliminated the hyperpolarizing phase and prolonged the depolarizing phase, but did not affect the spatial distribution of the response, thus suggesting {{that it is not the}} inhibitory system that is responsible for the inability of the MF input to generate beams of activity that propagate along the parallel fiber system...|$|R

In this paper we consider networks of IFB neurons with slow synaptic interactions and show how the dynamics may be described with a smooth firing rate model. When the firing rate of the IFB model is dominated by a refractory process the equations of motion simplify and may be solved exactly. Numerical simulations are used {{to show that a}} pair of reciprocally interacting inhibitory spiking IFB TC neurons supports an alternating rhythm of the type predicted from the firing rate theory. A change in a single parameter of the IFB neuron allows it to fire a burst of spikes in response to a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal,</b> so that it mimics the behavior of a reticular (RE) cell.

40|$|To gain an {{understanding}} of the role of electrical signaling in trees, poplar (Populus trichocarpa, Populus tremula × P. tremuloides) shoots were stimulated by chilling as well as flaming. Two kinds of signal propagation were detected by microelectrode measurements (aphid technique) in the phloem of leaf veins: (1) basipetal, short-distance signaling that led to rapid membrane hyperpolarization caused by K+-efflux within the leaf lamina; and (2) acropetal, long-distance signaling that triggered depolarization of the membrane potential in the leaf phloem. In the latter, the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> travel across the stem from the manipulated leaves to adjacent leaves where the net CO 2 uptake rate is temporarily depressed toward compensation. With regard to photosystem II, both heat-induced long-distance and short-distance signaling were investigated using two-dimensional “imaging” analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence. Both types of signaling significantly reduced the quantum yield of electron transport through photosystem II. Imaging analysis revealed that the signal that causes yield reduction spreads through the leaf lamina. Coldblocking of the stem proved that the electrical signal transmission via the phloem becomes disrupted, causing the leaf gas exchange to remain unaffected. Calcium-deficient trees showed a marked contrast inasmuch as the amplitude of the electrical signal was distinctly reduced, concomitant with the absence of a significant response in leaf gas exchange upon flame wounding. In summary, the above results led us to conclude that calcium as well as potassium is involved in the propagation of phloem-transmitted electrical signals that evoke specific responses in the photosynthesis of leaves...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{experimental}} studies demonstrated that neurotransmitters {{are an important}} factor {{for the development of}} the central nervous system, affecting neurodevelopmental events like neurogenesis, neuronal migration, programmed cell death, and differentiation. While the role of the classical neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on neuronal development is well established, the aminosulfonic acid taurine has also been considered as possible neuromodulator during early neuronal development. The purpose of the present review article is to summarize the properties of taurine as neuromodulator in detail, focusing on the direct involvement of taurine on various neurodevelopmental events and the regulation of neuronal activity during early developmental epochs. The current knowledge is that taurine lacks a synaptic release mechanism but is released by volume-sensitive organic anion channels and/or a reversal of the taurine transporter. Extracellular taurine affects neurons and neuronal progenitor cells mainly via glycine, GABA(A), and GABA(B) receptors with considerable receptor and subtype-specific affinities. Taurine has been shown to directly influence neurogenesis in vitro as well as neuronal migration in vitro and in vivo. It provides a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal</b> for a variety of neuronal population in the immature central nervous system, thereby directly influencing neuronal activity. While in the neocortex, taurine probably enhance neuronal activity, in the immature hippocampus, a tonic taurinergic tone might be necessary to attenuate activity. In summary, taurine must be considered as an essential modulator of neurodevelopmental events, and possible adverse consequences on fetal and/or early postnatal development should be evaluated for pharmacological therapies affecting taurinergic functions...|$|R
40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +) is an {{universal}} {{second messenger}} that regulates {{the most important}} activities of all eukaryotic cells. It is of critical importance to neurons as it participates in the transmission of the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal</b> and contributes to synaptic activity. Neurons have thus developed extensive and intricate Ca 2 + signaling pathways to couple the Ca 2 + signal to their biochemical machinery. Ca 2 + influx into neurons occurs through plasma membrane receptors and voltage-dependent ion channels. The release of Ca 2 + from the intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, by intracellular channels also contributes to the elevation of cytosolic Ca 2 +. Inside the cell, Ca 2 + {{is controlled by the}} buffering action of cytosolic Ca 2 +-binding proteins and by its uptake and release by mitochondria. The uptake of Ca 2 + in the mitochondrial matrix stimulates the citric acid cycle, thus enhancing ATP production and the removal of Ca 2 + from the cytosol by the ATP-driven pumps in the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. A Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger in the plasma membrane also participates in the control of neuronal Ca 2 +. The impaired ability of neurons to maintain an adequate energy level may impact Ca 2 + signaling: this occurs during aging and in neurodegenerative disease processes.

40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +) is {{an almost}} {{universal}} second messenger that regulates important activities of all eukaryotic cells. It is of critical importance to neurons, which have developed extensive and intricate pathways to couple the Ca 2 + signal to their biochemical machinery. In particular, Ca 2 + participates in the transmission of the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signal</b> and contributes to synaptic activity. During aging and in neurodegenerative disease processes, the ability of neurons to maintain an adequate energy level can be compromised, thus impacting on Ca 2 + homeostasis. In Parkinson's disease (PD), many signs of neurodegeneration result from compromised mitochondrial function attributable to specific effects of toxins on the mitochondrial respiratory chain and/or to genetic mutations. Despite these effects being present in almost all cell types, a distinguishing feature of PD is the extreme selectivity of cell loss, which is restricted to the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral portion of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain such selectivity, but only recently it has been convincingly shown that the innate autonomous activity of these neurons, which is sustained by their specific Cav 1. 3 L-type channel pore-forming subunit, {{is responsible for the}} generation of basal metabolic stress that, under physiological conditions, is compensated by mitochondrial buffering. However, when mitochondria function becomes even partially compromised (because of aging, exposure to environmental factors or genetic mutations), the metabolic stress overwhelms the protective mechanisms, and the process of neurodegeneration is engaged.

40|$|Seizure-induced {{release of}} the neuromodulator {{adenosine}} is a potent endogenous anticonvulsant mechanism, which limits the extension of seizures and mediates seizure arrest. For this reason several adenosine-based therapies for epilepsy are currently under development. However, {{it is not known}} how adenosine modulates GABAergic transmission in the context of seizure activity. This may be particularly relevant as strong activation of GABAergic inputs during epileptiform activity can switch GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A) R) signaling from inhibitory to excitatory, which is a process that plays a significant role in intractable epilepsies. We used gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings to investigate the role of seizure-induced adenosine release in the modulation of postsynaptic GABA(A) R signaling in pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus. Consistent with previous reports, GABA(A) R responses during seizure activity transiently switched from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing and excitatory. We found that adenosine released during the seizure significantly attenuated the depolarizing GABA(A) R responses and also reduced the extent of the after-discharge phase of the seizure. These effects were mimicked by exogenous adenosine administration and could not be explained by a change in chloride homeostasis mechanisms that set the reversal potential for GABA(A) Rs, or by a change in the conductance of GABA(A) Rs. Rather, A(1) R-dependent activation of potassium channels increased the cell's membrane conductance and thus had a shunting effect on GABA(A) R currents.

However, when it comes to NPs in multicomponent and optically complex aqueous matrices - such as biological media and physiological fluids - light scattering suffers from lack of selectivity, as distinguishing the relevant optical signals from the irrelevant ones is very challenging. We meet this challenge by building on <b>depolarized</b> scattering: Unwanted <b>signals</b> from the matrix are completely suppressed. This approach yields information with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio in favour of the NPs and NP-biomolecule corona complexes, which in turn opens the frontier to scattering-based studies addressing the behaviour of NPs in complex physiological/biological fluids...|$|R
30|$|Human body {{is treated}} {{electrically}} neutral {{due to the}} same number of positive and negative charges. The nerve cell membrane is polarized in the resting state. When a neuron is stimulated the muscle fiber <b>depolarizes</b> as the <b>signal</b> spreads along the surface and muscle fiber contraction happens. This depolarization, along with the movement of ions, makes an electric field near the muscle fiber. An EMG signal is the train of Motor Unit Action Potential (MUAP) showing the muscle response to neural stimulation (Reaz et al. 2006). In case of speech delivery, EMG signals are generated in the facial muscles by opening or closing lips, mouth and jaw as well. Consequently, EMG signals also appear in the extrinsic muscles of the tongue. The number of muscles involved in speech production is very high (Tuller et al. 1981) and therefore, high sensitive EMG device should be used to collect the facial EMG signal.|$|R
40|$|Proteins have {{interesting}} {{mechanical properties}} {{in addition to}} the remarkable functionality. For example, Guanylate kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes Guano- sine monophosphate (GMP) to Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) conversion and this enzyme is approximately 5 nm in size. A gold nano particle of similar size shows linear elasticity for strains up to ∼ 0. 1 % and shows plastic deformation beyond that, whereas the enzyme Guanylate kinase can have strains up to 1 % with reversible deformation. Our experiments show many different regimes of the mechanical response before the plastic deformation of these proteins. In this dissertation, I study the materials properties of two classes of proteins, an ion channel protein and a transferase, which is a globular protein. The experimental techniques to study the materials properties of these proteins were uniquely de- veloped at the Zocchi lab. Therefore, we were able to observe previously unknown characteristics of these folded proteins. The mechanical properties of the voltage gated potassium channel KvAP was studied by applying AC depolarizing voltages. This technique gave new informa- tion about the system that was not seen in the previous studies. These previous experiments were based on applying DC depolarizing voltage steps across the membrane to study the ionic current. By monitoring the ionic current at different depolarizing voltage steps, the DC gating process of the channel could be under- stood. We probed the channel using AC <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals</b> instead of DC pulses and the ionic current revealed new behaviors, which cannot be predicted with the DC response. We found that the conformational motion of the voltage sensing domain of the ion channel shows internal dissipation. Further, a new non lin- earity in the dissipation parameter was found in which the dissipation parameter increased with the shear rate of the applied force. Previous studies at the Zocchi lab used a nano rheology experiment on the protein Guanylate kinase to study the mechanical properties of a globular pro- tein. The protein was subjected to a mechanical force and the deformation was measured with sub-Angstrom resolution. We found that the protein shows a linear elasticity regime for low forcing and viscoelastic behavior for high forcing. The in- ternal viscosity of the protein is due to the internal dissipation of the protein. This dissertation takes the work on nano rheology of proteins further by studying the temperature effect on the materials properties of the protein and the contribution of the surface of the protein to the observed mechanics. In addition to studying the materials properties of proteins, we used proteins to design new biomimetic systems. The first system covered in this dissertation is the development of a novel sensor platform for molecules. In this sensor, we detect the change in the stiffness of the substrate upon binding a target rather than the usual scheme of detecting the change in mass upon binding of a target. By combining the nano rheology setup with localized surface plasmon resonance, this sensor platform yields a very robust signal. The other biomimetic system that is discussed here is an artificial axon is constructed with ion channels and lipid bilayers...|$|R
40|$|Previous study {{indicates}} that in the cerebellum. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and NGF receptors are highly expressed during late embryonic and early postnatal development, suggesting that NGF may {{play an important role}} in cerebellar ontogeny. However, while receptor had been localized to some cerebellar populations, delineation of receptor subtypes, and potential physiologic function remained to the defined. The objective of this thesis was to define the role that NGF plays in cerebellar ontogeny. Initial studies were devoted to the localization of NGF binding sites to cell types in the developing cerebellum, and to the definition of receptor subtypes. 125 I-. NGF binding was employed to delineate low- and high-affinity receptor sites in the postnatal rat cerebellum. Both high-affinity and low-affinity receptor sites were localized to cell bodies, dendrites and axonal processes of Purkinje cells. The expression of the biologically active, high-affinity receptors was found to correlate with cerebellar development, and suggested that N G F may regulate the normal ontogeny of Purkinje cells. The development of cerebellar Purkinje cells is subject to regulation by multiple epigenetic signals. To define mechanisms by which trophic and presynaptic stimulation may potentially regulate Purkinje cell ontogeny, I studied the effects of N G F and excitatory transmitters on Purkinje cell survival and morphological maturation in dissociated cell culture. Purkinje cells were identified by expression of Vitamin D-dependent Calcium Binding Protein (CaBP), and by their characteristic morphology. N G F receptors were selectively localized to Purkinje cells both by ligand and monoclonal antibody binding, suggesting responsivity to the trophic agent. Simultaneous exposure to the pharmacologic depolarizing agents, high-potassium or veratridine, and N G F specifically enhanced Purkinje cell survival in culture. Furthermore, N G F together with the excitatory neurotransmitters, aspartate or glutamate, promoted a 2 -fold increase in survival. In addition, N G F increased Purkinje cell size and promoted neurite elaboration. These effects required simultaneous exposure to N G F and either aspartate, glutamate or pharmacologic depolarizing agents. Effects on survival or neurite elaboration were not evoked by exposure to trophic factor or transmitters alone. These results suggested a novel mechanism for regulation of development, in which trophic factors and afferent stimulation interact. To begin to investigate potential mechanisms by which excitatory signals and NGF interact in the regulation of Purkinje cell development I studied regulation of NGF receptor expression by excitatory influences in dissociated cerebellar cell cultures. Sensitive receptor-protein cross-linking, and ribonuclease protection assays were employed to evaluate NGF receptor protein, and message levels respectively. Exposure of neurons in culture to either pharmacologic depolarizing agents, or to the normal afferent neurotransmitter aspartate, resulted in a 2 to 3 fold increase in N G F receptor expression. In addition to the N G F receptor, expression of the NGF gene was examined. Cerebellar glia were identified as the source of N G F expression, and the synthesis of the trophic factor was also subject to regulation by <b>depolarizing</b> <b>signals.</b> Together, the results presented in this thesis suggest that afferent innervation and N G F interact to promote survival and morphogenesis of developing Purkinje cells...|$|R

This aim of this research is to study the effects of dust particles on the polarization state of microwave signal. The calculations, which were based on the probability density of Iraqi dust storms, were performed for six frequency bands of microwave signals. Results showed that strong and severe dust storms can highly <b>depolarized</b> the microwave <b>signal</b> through induced differential attenuation and differential phase shift. These two parameters also depends on the shape of the dust particle, particles with low axial ratio can induce relatively high differential attenuation and differential phase shift, and therefore cause more depolarization in the signal. It was found that the relative humidity can only affect the differential attenuation and this effect is minimized at band of high frequency...|$|R
