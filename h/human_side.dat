40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the sense of}} the human life in the context of evolutionary consciousness theory, which doesn’t reject or opposite any thesises of philosophical science history. Its only expands them. The conception called “essence of life” contain human past and future lives, material and spiritual <b>human</b> <b>sides,</b> its uniqueness as a part of internal endless. A human appears as a result of evolution and simultaneously a “laboratory of consciousness”, transitional historical process. Human function is to individualize their consciousness, to find internal freedom getting stronger. Attention is focused on the unity of material and spiritual <b>human</b> <b>sides,</b> its uniqueness as a part of internal endless.

5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{directors are}} allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythology with common themes and deities, but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories. Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused more on the <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0, while Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV, referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand {{on which to build}} multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine {{of the first half of}} the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million.|$|E

5000|$|Its teachings on spiritual {{awakening}} {{claim to}} be similar but not identical to such eastern traditions as Zen and Advaita Vedanta {{in that it is}} founded on the conviction of the reality of non-dual consciousness. According to Waking Down, awakening to the fact that one is not exclusively one's human nature makes it possible to work with oneself on the human level more effectively. For this reason WDM also encourages an embrace of the passionate and <b>human</b> <b>sides</b> of life referred to as [...] "Down". As such it has more in common with the tantric traditions of India. The paradoxical embrace of both the worldly and spiritual dimensions of life, and the attention it brings to conscious mutual relationships, is considered central to the Waking Down teaching.|$|R
