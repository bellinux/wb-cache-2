50|$|Gene {{trapping}} is a high-throughput {{approach that}} is used to introduce insertional mutations across the mammalian genome. It is performed with <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> vectors whose principal element is a gene trapping cassette consisting of a promoterless reporter gene and/or selectable genetic marker flanked by an upstream 3’ splice site (splice acceptor; SA) and a downstream transcriptional termination sequence (polyadenylation sequence; polyA). When inserted into an intron of an expressed gene, the <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> cassette is transcribed from the endogenous promoter of that gene {{in the form of a}} fusion transcript in which the exon(s) upstream of the insertion site is spliced in frame to the reporter/selectable marker gene. Since transcription is terminated prematurely at the inserted polyadenylation site, the processed fusion transcript encodes a truncated and nonfunctional version of the cellular protein and the reporter/selectable marker. Thus, gene traps simultaneously inactivate and report the expression of the trapped gene at the insertion site, and provide a DNA tag (<b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> sequence tag, GTST) for the rapid identification of the disrupted gene.An international public consortium International <b>Gene</b> <b>Trap</b> Consortium is centralizing the data and cell lines can be requested from them.|$|E
5000|$|... piggyBac (PB) DNA transposons {{mobilize}} via a [...] "cut-and-paste" [...] mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme (PB transposase), encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon {{at other}} sites within the genome. PB transposase specifically recognizes PB inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. PB then integrates at TTAA sites throughout the genome, {{in a relatively}} random fashion. For the creation of <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> mutations (or adapted for generating transgenic animals), the transposase is supplied in trans on one plasmid and is co-transfected with a plasmid containing donor transposon, a recombinant transposon comprising a <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> flanked by the binding sites for the transposase (ITRs). The transposase will catalyze the excision of the transposon from the plasmid and subsequent integration into the genome. Integration within a coding region will capture the elements necessary for <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> expression. PB possesses several ideal properties: (1) it preferentially inserts within genes (50 to 67% of insertions hit genes) (2) it exhibits no local hopping (widespread genomic coverage) (3) it is not sensitive toover-production inhibition in which elevated levels of the transposase cause decreased transposition 4) it excises cleanly from a donor site, leaving no “footprint,” unlike Sleeping Beauty.|$|E

This makes <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> more easily amenable for large scale projects than targeting. On the other hand, gene targeting can be used for genes with low transcriptions that would go undetected in a trap screen. Also, the probability of trapping increases with intron size.

Surprisingly, <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> by the International Mouse Knockout Consortium (IMKC) to generate putative Glo 1 knockout mice produced a mouse {{line with the}} phenotype characterised as normal and healthy. Here, we show that <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> mutation was successful, but the presence of Glo 1 gene duplication, probably in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) before <b>gene</b> <b>trapping,</b> maintained wild-type levels of Glo 1 expression and activity and sustained the healthy phenotype. In further investigation {{of the consequences of}} dicarbonyl stress in ESCs, we found that prolonged exposure of mouse ESCs in culture to high concentrations of MG and/or hypoxia led to low-level increase in Glo 1 copy number. In clinical translation, we found a high prevalence of low-level GLO 1 copy number increase in renal failure where there is severe dicarbonyl stress. In conclusion, the IMKC Glo 1 mutant mouse is not deficient in Glo 1 expression through duplication of the Glo 1 wild-type allele. Dicarbonyl stress and/or hypoxia induces low-level copy number alternation in ESCs. Similar processes may drive rare GLO 1 duplication in health and disease...|$|R

50|$|The {{biological}} role of JADE1 has {{not been}} elucidated. Limited number of publications addresses this question using mice models. The most comprehensive study {{which was published in}} 2003, identified mice orthologue of human JADE1, Jade1, and investigated Jade1 expression during mice embryogenesis. Searching for developmentally regulated genes the authors used <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> screen analysis and identified mouse Jade1 as gene strongly regulated during embryogenesis. Insertion of the vector into the third intron of the Jade1 gene lead to the production of a 47-amino-acid truncated protein. The <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> insertional mutation resulted in Jade1-beta-galactosidase reporter fusion product and Jade1 null allele. While the homozygotes for the <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> integration did not produce strong developmental phenotype, the fusion product revealed Jade1 gene spatial-temporal expression in mouse embryonic cells and tissues of developing embryo up to 15.5-d.p.c. In addition the study reports experimental and in silico comparative analysis of Jade1 mRNA transcripts, Jade1 gene structure and analysis of Jade1 protein orthologues from mouse human and zebra fish.Jade1 expression was detected in extraembryonic ectoderm and trophoblast, which are placental components important for vasculogenesis, as well as in sites enriched with multipotent or tissue-specific progenitors, including neural progenitors(2). The dynamics of Jade1 reporter expression in these areas indicates the involvement in the determination and elongation of anterior posterior axis, an important point of the study). The potential role for human JADE1 in the renewal of embryonic stem cell and embryonal carcinoma cell cultures was suggested in another screening study which showed that, in cultured stem cells activation of stem cell transcription factor OCT4 pathway upregulated JADE1 gene expression along with stem cell factors NANOG, PHC1, USP44 and SOX2.Role of JADE1 in epithelial cell proliferation was addressed in a murine model of acute kidney injury and regeneration. Expression patterns and dynamics of HBO1-JADE1S/L were examined in regenerating tubular epithelial cells. Ischemia and reperfusion injury resulted in an initial decrease in JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 protein levels, which returned to the baseline during renal recovery. Expression levels of HBO1 and JADE1S recovered as cell proliferation rate reached maximum, whereas JADE1L recovered after bulk proliferation had diminished. The temporal expression of JADE1 correlated with the acetylation of histone H4 (H4K5 and H4K12) but not that of histone H3 (H4K14), suggesting that the JADE1-HBO1 complex specifically marks H4 during epithelial cell proliferation. The results of the study implicate JADE1-HBO1 complex in acute kidney injury and suggest distinct roles for JADE1 isoforms during epithelial cell recovery.|$|E

Loss of Gata 6 resulted in enhanced proliferation and transformation of astrocytes. Human malignant astrocytoma cell lines, explant xenografts, and operative specimens demonstrated loss of GATA 6 expression. Loss-of-function GATA 6 mutations with loss of heterozygosity of the GATA 6 locus were found in human malignant astrocytoma specimens but not in lower-grade astrocytomas or normal adult astrocytes. Knockdown of Gata 6 expression in V 12 Ha-Ras or p 53 −/− astrocytes, but not in parental murine or human astrocytes, led to acceleration of tumorgenesis. Knockin GATA 6 expression in human malignant astrocytoma cells reduced their tumorgenic growth with decreased VEGF expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GATA 6, isolated from a murine astrocytoma model, is a novel tumor suppressor gene that is a direct target of mutations during malignant progression of murine and human astrocytomas.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{trapping}} is {{a powerful}} tool for gene discovery and functional genomics in both animals and plants. Upon insertion of the <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> construct into an expressed gene, splice donor and acceptor sites facilitate the generation of transcriptional fusions between the flanking sequence and the reporter. Consequently, detection of reporter gene expression allows the identification of genes based on their expression pattern. Up to now rice is the only cereal crop for which <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> approaches exist. In this study we describe a <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> system in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) based on the maize transposable elements Ac/Ds. Results We generated <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> barley lines by crossing Ac transposase expressing plants with multiple independent transformants carrying the Ds based <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> construct GT Ds B. Upstream of the β-Glucuronidase start codon GT Ds B carries splice donor and acceptor sites optimized for monocotyledonous plants. DNA blot analysis revealed GT Ds B transposition frequencies of 11 % and 26 % in the F 1 and F 2 generation of <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> lines and perpetuation of transposition activity in later generations. Furthermore, analysis of sequences flanking transposed GT Ds B elements evidenced preferential insertion into expressed regions of the barley genome. We screened leaves, nodes, immature florets, pollinated florets, immature grains and seedlings of F 2 plants and detected GUS expression in 51 % (72 / 141) of the plants. Thus, reporter gene expression was found in 24 of the 28 F 1 lines tested and in progeny of all GT Ds B parental lines. Conclusion Due to the frequent transposition of GT Ds B and the efficient expression of the GUS reporter gene, we conclude that this Ac/Ds -based <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> system is an applicable approach for gene discovery in barley. The successful introduction of a <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> construct optimized for monocots in barley contributes a novel functional genomics tool for this cereal crop. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{large-scale}} <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> approach for the isolation and mutation of genes that might play roles in the developing nervous system. After in vitro integration of two different <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> vectors (pGT 1. 8 geo: Skarnes et al. [1995] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 : 6592 - 6596; IRES beta geo: Chowdhury et al. [1997] Nucleic Acids Res. 25 : 1531 - 1536) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, we created 64 transgenic mouse lines. The expression analysis of the reporter gene during embryogenesis of heterozygous embryos revealed 47 lines {{with a variety of}} patterns. Around one-third (36 %) of these <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> lines showed spatiotemporal expression that was either restricted predominantly in the developing nervous system (11 lines; 17 %) or widespread but with very high levels of expression in the nervous tissue (12 lines; 19 %). In most cases, a correlation was found between the in vitro and the in vivo patterns of the reporter gene expression. Thus far, preliminary mutant analysis of 16 <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> lines with potentially interesting expression patterns in the developing nervous system showed that mice homozygous for eight (50 %) insertions were lethal, whereas the homozygous mice from five <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> lines (31 %) showed a lower than expected Mendelian ratio of live homozygous animals. Analysis of beta-galactosidase reporter gene expression during embryogenesis has shown that four transgenic lines are useful lacZ in situ markers for specific regions of the developing nervous system. Here, we discuss some in vivo and in vitro selection criteria that may increase the number of the trapped genes potentially involved in the control of neural development and some future strategies to improve further the efficiency of the <b>gene</b> <b>trap</b> approach...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe actin binding {{proteins}} cortexillin I and II play a {{major role}} in Dictyostelium cytokinesis, in which they are found localized to the membranes of the cleavage furrow. Here we report on cortexillin I mutants isolated by <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> in Polysphondylium. The original mutation and reconstructed versions of the original, as well as cortexillin I deletions, are unable to form aggregation streams under starvation conditions. The fruiting bodies that do form when cells are grown on bacterial lawns lack the one- and two-dimensional symmetries so apparent in wild type. These two phenotypes and the proposed structural basis for them suggest that cortexillin I functions in chemotaxis and morphogenesis in addition to its role in cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) {{made the}} ambitious promise to {{generate}} mutations {{in virtually every}} protein-coding gene of the mouse genome in a concerted worldwide action. Now, 5  years later, the IKMC members have developed high-throughput <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> and, in particular, gene-targeting pipelines and generated more than 17, 400 mutant murine embryonic stem (ES) cell clones and more than 1, 700 mutant mouse strains, most of them conditional. A common IKMC web portal (www. knockoutmouse. org) has been established, allowing easy access to this unparalleled biological resource. The IKMC materials considerably enhance functional gene annotation of the mammalian genome and will {{have a major impact}} on future biomedical research. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Retrovirus (RV) is {{efficient}} for {{gene transfer}} and integration in dividing cells of diverse organisms. RV provides {{a powerful tool}} for insertional mutagenesis (IM) to identify and functionally analyze genes essential for normal and pathological processes. Here we report RV-mediated gene transfer and genome-wide IM in fish stem cells from medaka and zebrafish. Three RVs were produced for fish cell transduction: rvLegfp and rvLcherry produce green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry fluorescent protein respectively under control of human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter upon any chromosomal integration, whereas rvGTgfp contains a splicing acceptor and expresses GFP only upon <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> (GT) via intronic in-frame integration and spliced to endogenous active genes. We show that rvLegfp and rvLcherry produce a transduction efficiency of 11 ~ 23 % in medaka and zebrafish stem cell lines, which is as 30 ~ 67 % efficient as the positive control in NIH/ 3 T 3. Upon co-infection with rvGTgfp and rvLcherry, GFP-positive cells were much fewer than Cherry-positive cells, consistent with rareness of productive <b>gene</b> <b>trapping</b> events versus random integration. Importantly, rvGTgfp infection in the medaka haploid embryonic stem (ES) cell line HX 1 generated GTgfp insertion on all 24 chromosomes of the haploid genome. Similar to the mammalian haploid cells, these insertion events were presented predominantly in intergenic regions and introns but rarely in exons. RV-transduced HX 1 retained the ES cell properties such as stable growth, embryoid body formation and pluripotency gene expression. Therefore, RV is proficient for gene transfer and IM in fish stem cells. Our results open new avenue for genome-wide IM in medaka haploid ES cells in culture...|$|R
