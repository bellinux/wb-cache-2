The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the Mid Sussex district.|$|E
5|$|Although Khan {{has bought}} Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, {{saying that she}} has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys {{the set of the}} film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour {{deadline}} to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to document the number of controlled substance prescriptions filled by adolescents and young adult patients in the 2 years prior to presentation for opiate dependence treatment. Methods. Opiate-dependent youth () presenting to our Medication-Assisted Treatment for Addiction program from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2010 were identified via electronic medical record. Subjects were further classified based on their opiate use as dependent to heroin-only, prescription (Rx) opiate-only, or combined heroin + Rx opiate only. The Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System (OARRS) was used to identify each subject's controlled substance prescription history. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationships between patient characteristics and the total number of prescriptions filled. Results. Twenty-five percent of subjects <b>had</b> <b>filled</b> ≥ 6 prescriptions, and 15 % <b>had</b> <b>filled</b> ≥ 11 prescriptions. The mean number of prescriptions filled was 5 (range: 0 – 59). Thirteen percent <b>had</b> <b>filled</b> ≥ 6 opiate/narcotic prescriptions, and 8 % <b>had</b> <b>filled</b> ≥ 11 prescriptions. Conclusions. A subset of opiate-dependent youth <b>had</b> <b>filled</b> multiple opiate/narcotic prescriptions providing some evidence that physician-provided prescriptions may be a source of opiate abuse or diversion for a minority of opiate-dependent adolescents and young adults...|$|R

When the metal <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> all crevices and has settled and hardened and cooled, the mould is broken off. The bronze figure thus obtained is then cleaned, finer details are added, blemishes are removed, smoothened, and polished well. Hence each bronze icon is unique and the mould cannot {{be used to create}} copies.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of UDDTs compared to pit latrines is {{the conversion of}} feces into a dry odorless material and therefore an avoidance of the issues surrounding liquid fecal sludge management (e.g. odor, fly attraction, difficulties in pit emptying). A well-maintained UDDT is an odor and insect free toilet which is appreciated by users and allows simple removal and far less offensive and safer handling of the fecal material once the feces vault <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> up. Moreover, the risk of water pollution is minimised through the safe containment of feces in above-ground vaults and this allows the toilets to be constructed in locations where pit-based systems are not appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for a theory going beyond the Big Bang is the theory of cosmic inflation. Developed by Alan Guth {{and others in the}} 1980s, inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard Big Bang theory. The theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the Big Bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe. The theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background, the radiation that <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> the sky since around 380,000 years after the Big Bang.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1980s, the old {{business}} district centered on 7th Avenue (La Septima) began a slow recovery, {{first as a}} bohemian haven for artists and, by the early 1990s, as a popular nightlife and entertainment district. Since 2000, many historic structures near 7th Avenue have been renovated and restored, and construction <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> in most long-vacant lots. Among the new structures are hotels, office and retail space, and apartment complexes, leading to the Ybor City's first population increases in over half a century. Residential areas such as V.M. Ybor and Tampa Heights have also begun to see gentrification, with older structures being restored and new ones built.|$|E
25|$|It was Hucklesby's {{dream that}} the house would become a museum that would be 'interesting {{as well as of}} an {{educational}} nature'. Unfortunately, the house itself had been neglected and suffered from dry rot, Luton council could not immediately afford the renovations. It remained empty for several years until it became a military hospital during the First World War. After the war, rooms were let to council employees with a cafe opening on the ground floor. The museum opened in 1930, having moved from the Carnegie library where it started in 1927. At first the museum displays were held in just two rooms, but over the years it <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> the entire house. The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays from 10am to 5pm and Sundays from 1 to 5pm. Admission is free.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{continued}} to occasionally play in colts and second XI matches throughout the late 1980s. His sole match at first-class level {{came during the}} 1990–91 season, in a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland. In the match, held at the Gabba in February 1991, Harris played as a specialist batsman, opening the batting with Mark Lavender in both innings. He was dismissed for a duck in the first innings, but scored 23 runs in the second innings {{as part of a}} 61-run opening stand with Lavender (113*). At grade cricket level, Harris played for both Southern Districts (later Willetton) and Subiaco-Floreat. After retiring, he <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> several positions with the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) at various stages, including manager and coach of the state under-19 team, coach of the state second XI, state selector, state high-performance manager, and state talent manager. As state coaching manager, he was also involved in launching the Dennis Lillee Fast Bowling Academy in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Marsh did {{not return}} to the Test team until 2014, and from 2014 until 2016 was a fringe player who <b>has</b> <b>filled</b> in for an injured top-order batsman on several occasions. His first recall was in February 2014 as a {{replacement}} for Shane Watson in the first Test of Australia's 2013–14 tour of South Africa; he scored 148 runs in his first innings, but was dropped after getting a pair in the second Test. He was recalled to the line-up in December 2014 for the home series against India after captain Michael Clarke tore his hamstring, and scored 254 runs at 42.33 in three Tests. He played both Tests in the 2015 tour of the West Indies after Chris Rogers withdrew with concussion, scoring 112 runs at 37.33. He toured with the Australian team throughout the subsequent 2015 Ashes series, playing well in tour matches but failing (with scores of 0 and 2) in the sole Test for which he was selected. He played two home Tests in 2015–16, one against New Zealand and one against the West Indies after Usman Khawaja suffered a hamstring injury, and in the match against the West Indies scored 182, the highest score of his career to date.|$|E
