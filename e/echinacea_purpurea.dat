This plant has many pharmaceutical effects {{which one of the}} most important uses is Immunostimulating. This research attempts to study the effects of <b>Echinaceae</b> <b>purpurea</b> hydroalcoholic extract on the blood parameters in little laboratory female mice (Balb/c species). Materials and Methods: In this research, 48 mature female mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. The control group did not receive any extract, the placebo group received 0. 5 cc normal saline every other day and 4 treatment groups received extract with (50, 100, 200, 300) mg/kg/ 2 day doses that was used interperitoneal injection. Then the blood samples were taken from the whole mice. The results were analyzed in the case that p< 0. 05,using SPSS software. Results: The study of blood parameters showed that the extract increased markedly in the total number of white blood cells in each of 4 treatment groups in comparison with control group. The number of neutrophiles decreased significantly in each of 4 treatment groups in comparison with control group, but the significant difference wasn’t noticed in monocytes. The number of red blood cells increased significantly in groups 1, 2 in comparison with the control group, but in groups 3 and 4 there was no significant difference.

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} UVA (315 – 400 nm) {{irradiation}} on <b>Echinaceae</b> <b>purpureae</b> interactions with free radicals was {{examined by the}} use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The changes of antioxidant properties of E. purpureae with time of UV irradiation from 10 to 110 min (10 min steps) were determined. DPPH as the paramagnetic reference was used in this study. Changes of EPR signals of the reference after interactions with nonir-radiated and UV-irradiated E. purpureae were detected. Interactions of the tested E. purpureae samples caused decrease of the EPR signal of DPPH as the result of its antioxidant properties. The decrease of the amplitude of EPR line of DPPH was lower for interactions with UV-irradiated E. purpureae. EPR examination confirmed anti-oxidant properties of E. purpureae. The weaker antioxidant properties of E. purpureae after UV irradiation were pointed out. E. purpureae should be storage in the dark.

In the present study the cytotoxic effects of polyacetylenes single compounds isolated by a bio-guided assay fractionation from an E. pallida hexanic extract and their potential bioavailability were investigated. Antitumoral effects were assessed on human pancreatic MIA PaCa- 2 and colonic COLO 320 cancer cell lines. Cell viability was evaluated by the colorimetric WST- 1 assay and apoptotic cell death was evaluated by an immunoenzimatic analysis of the cytosolic internucleosomal DNA enrichment and by the caspase 3 / 7 activity test. Bioavailability was studied using the Caco- 2 cell monolayer, an in vitro model of intestinal permeability.

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of herbal medicines, documented herb-drug interactions are sparse. We have reviewed the literature to determine the possible interactions between the seven top-selling herbal medicines (ginkgo, St John's wort, ginseng, garlic, echinacea, saw palmetto and kava) and prescribed drugs. Literature searches were performed using the following databases: Medline (via Pubmed), Cochrane Library, Embase and phytobase (all from their inception to July 2000). All data relating to herb-drug interactions were included regardless of whether they were based on case reports, case series, clinical trials or other types of investigation in humans. In vitro experiments were excluded. Data were extracted by the first author and validated by the second author. 41 case reports or case series and 17 clinical trials were identified. The results indicate that St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) lowers blood concentrations of cyclosporin, amitriptyline, digoxin, indinavir, warfarin, phenprocoumon and theophylline; furthermore it causes intermenstrual bleeding, delirium or mild serotonin syndrome, respectively, when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol/desogestrel), loperamide or selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (sertaline, paroxetine, nefazodone). Ginkgo (ginkgo biloba) interactions include bleeding when combined with warfarin, raised blood pressure when combined with a thiazide diuretic and coma when combined with trazodone. Ginseng (Panax ginseng) lowers blood concentrations of alcohol and warfarin, and induces mania if used concomitantly with phenelzine. Garlic (Allium sativum) changes pharmacokinetic variables of paracetamol, decreases blood concentrations of warfarin and produces hypoglycaemia when taken with chlorpropamide. Kava (Piper methysticum) increases 'off' periods in Parkinson patients taking levodopa and can cause a semicomatose state when given concomitantly with alprazolam. No interactions were found for echinacea (<b>Echinacea</b> angustifolia, E. <b>purpurea,</b> E. pallida) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). In conclusion, interactions between herbal medicines and synthetic drugs exist and can have serious clinical consequences.

Moreover, they seem to reduce the endocytic activity {{and the production of}} IL- 10. No significant differences among the extracts belonging to the three analysed species have been noticed. Introduction. Echinacea represents a perennial plant indigenous to North America, but also cultured in Europe since a lot of years 1. Ten species belong to this genus 2, but only three species show pharmacological properties: E. angustifolia, E. pallida, E. purpurea 3. Up to date, formulations with Echinacea extracts are usually used for their immunomodulatory, antiiflammatory, antiviral and antioxidant activities, even if the mechanism of the action of their component has not yet been investigated. The goal of our study is to investigate the mechanism of action by which Echinacea phytocompounds have an immunoenhancing activity, focusing on the effects of these extracts on dendritic cell (DC) generation, maturation and biological activity. DCs are the most important antigen-presenting cells: they check both the first phase and the maintenance of adaptative immune responses and the induction of tolerance 4 - 7. Materials and Methods. DCs are in vitro generated from CD 14 + circling monocytes, obtained from mononuclear cells of healthy donors, through an immunomagnetic system (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Monocytes are cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, added with fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, streptomycin and penicillin and supplemented with growth factors (GM-CSF and IL- 4) 5, in presence or absence of total root extract of the three specie of <b>Echinacea</b> (E. <b>purpurea,</b> E. pallida, E. angustifolia). These extracts are tested at a concentration of 100, 150 and 200 μg/mL. After 6 days of incubation, LPS is added to the culture for further 24 hours, in order to induce maturation. Then, morphological and phenotypical analysis are performed respectively by cytospin, May-Grunwald Giemsa staining and cytometric assays. The markers used are CD 14 antigen, present on monocytes surface, but not on DC surface, CD 40 and CD 80 costimulatory molecules, HLA class II (HLA-DR) antigen and CD 83 antigen, expressed by mature DCs 8. Functional studies on DCs generated in presence of Echinacea include cytometric analysis of endocytotic activity mediated by mannose receptor, using the dextran FITC-conjugated as an antigen, and the dosage of culture surnatant cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 1, IL- 10, IL- 12, TNF-α, TGF-β) through an enzyme immunoassay. Results and Discussion. Echinacea phytocompounds don’t compromise DC generation from monocytes (loss of CD 14 expression on cells surface). Neverthless, total extracts interfere with the maturation, as the reduced expression of CD 83 antigen shows if compared to the control. Moreover, in presence of Echinacea, a reduced expression (both as percentage and mean) of the CD 80 and HLA-DR is observed, if compared to the control; as far the CD 40 antigen is concerned, its percentage remains unchanged, while the mean decreases in presence of the extracts, compared to the control. No significant differences of cell phenotype among the different concentrations used, nor among the extracts belonging to the three analysed species, is noticed (Fig. 1). When on the 6 th day we perform endocytosis assay, in presence of total root extract of Echinacea we observe no differences compared with the control: the cells show a marked phagocytic activity. On the contrary, on the 7 th day, the cells treated with E. purpurea keep a more intense activity if compared to the control, even if slightly inferior to that one shown at the immature stage (Fig. 2). Cytokine dosage is carried out on the 7 th day. In the sample treated with Echinacea we remark an increase in the release of IL- 1 and a decrease in the concentration of IL- 10, compared with the control. We notice no relevant differences between the three species we used (Fig. 3). Conclusions. Our study deserves further investigation. In fact, as far as the various and reported pharmacological properties is concerned, up to date the immunomodulatory activity is only partially elucidated. Analysing the literature and our data it seems fundamental to understand which are the compounds responsible of the pharmacological activity of the plant and the mechanism of action by which it is realized. For these reasons, we are going to study the activity of lipophilic and hydrophilic fractions of Echinacea extracts on DCs, but also evaluing the effects of separate active principals on these cells. It could be interesting to identify a possible fraction or species mainly responsible of the observed effects...|$|R
