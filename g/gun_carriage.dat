5|$|On 9 August, Saturday, {{the body}} was {{transferred}} to the Congress Building for an additional day of public viewing, and a memorial service attended by the entire Argentine legislative body. The next day, after a final Mass, the coffin was laid on a <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> pulled by CGT officials. It was followed by Peron, his cabinet, Eva's family and friends, the delegates and representatives of the Partido Peronista Femenino—then workers, nurses and students of the Eva Peron Foundation. Flowers were thrown from balconies and windows.|$|E
5|$|Elliott's funeral {{took place}} on 25 March. Following a short service at his home, his casket was drawn, with full {{military}} honours, including bands and an escort party, on a <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> pulled by horses resplendent with black plumes, to the Burwood Cemetery, a march of some four miles. Stanley Bruce, whose Prime Ministership {{had come to an}} end in late 1929, marched as a common returned soldier. Reports in the newspapers of the time state that several thousand people followed the cortège and lined the parade route. The parade was led by Rear Admiral William Munro Kerr, with Brigadier Generals Charles Brand, Thomas Blamey and J. C. Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The {{band of the}} Great Eastern Railway, {{augmented}} by drummers from the Royal Marines, played the Dead March. Eternal Father, Strong to Save and Abide with Me were sung, and a blessing given by the Bishop of London. The route of the coffin to Liverpool Street station was lined with people. Fryatt was buried at All Saints' Church, Upper Dovercourt. His coffin was carried from the station to the church on a <b>gun</b> <b>carriage.</b> His widow was presented with the insignia of the Belgian Order of Leopold that had been posthumously awarded to Fryatt. Fryatt was also posthumously awarded the Belgian Maritime War Cross.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, Kalam's {{body was}} airlifted in an Indian Air Force {{helicopter}} from Shillong to Guwahati, {{from where it}} was flown to New Delhi {{on the morning of}} 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.|$|E
5|$|Howell's body later washed ashore and was {{returned}} to Australia for burial; Fraser's remains were never discovered. Howell was accorded a funeral with full military honours, which took place at Warringal Cemetery, Heidelberg on 22 April 1920, with several hundred mourners in attendance; his widow, parents and sister were chief among these. A firing party of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery led the <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> bearing the coffin to the cemetery. Captains Adrian Cole, Frank Lukis and Raymond Brownell acted as pallbearers along with five other officers who had served in either the Royal or Australian Flying Corps. On 12 February 1923, a stained-glass window dedicated {{to the memory of}} Howell was unveiled by General Sir Harry Chauvel at St. Anselm's Church of England in Middle Park; Howell {{had been a member of}} the congregation there in his youth. Following the closure of St. Anselm's in 2001, the window was moved to St. Silas's Church, Albert Park, which is now also the parish church for the former parish of St. Anselm.|$|E

25|$|In {{recognition}} of his contributions as one of Singapore's founding fathers, Rajaratnam was accorded a state funeral at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay on 25 February 2006. The coffin was carried from Parliament House to the Esplanade at 1:30pm on a ceremonial <b>gun</b> <b>carriage,</b> past the historic Civic District. The service was attended by President S.R. Nathan, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament and invited {{people from all walks}} of life.|$|E
25|$|The gun emplacements are symmetrical, {{single-storeyed}} {{structures of}} off-form concrete, waffle slab roof supported on three columns with earth fill on top, Australian-designed circular recoil pit with central pad and outlying rail for <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> traverse, side magazines {{of concrete and}} concrete block construction. Camouflage net pivot points are extant, and doors remain on the lower emplacement magazines. The robust off-form concrete construction is unlike the two-storeyed coastal battery gun emplacements of Moreton Bay, where timber as well as concrete was used structurally.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow both range and bearing to be {{measured}} at the same time, separate antennas, receivers, amplifiers and displays were needed. The antennas were mounted on triangular trusses mounted rigidly to a wooden cabin, in turn mounted on an AA <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> bearing system which allowed the entire cabin to be rotated around the vertical axis. For tracking, the transmitter and receiver cabins were both {{turned to face the}} general direction of the target. The result was an unwieldy system of some complexity.|$|E

25|$|Artillery captain Józef Bem of the Kingdom of Poland started {{experiments}} {{with what was}} then called in Polish raca kongrewska. These culminated in his 1819 report Notes sur les fusees incendiares (German edition: Erfahrungen über die Congrevischen Brand-Raketen bis zum Jahre 1819 in der Königlischen Polnischen Artillerie gesammelt, Weimar 1820). The research {{took place in the}} Warsaw Arsenal, where captain Józef Kosiński also developed the multiple-rocket launchers adapted from horse artillery <b>gun</b> <b>carriage.</b> The 1st Rocketeer Corps was formed in 1822, it first saw combat during the Polish–Russian War 1830–31.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> was {{designed}} to be towed behind a limber and six horses; the lower carriage comprised a box trail. The QF 4.5 fired a separate round (i.e. shell and cartridge were loaded separately). The barrel was of built-up type, with a horizontal sliding block breech. A limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. It {{was designed}} for one-man laying with both traverse and elevation controls and sights on the left. The recoil system was below the barrel and used a hydraulic buffer with a hydro-pneumatic recuperator to return the barrel to its firing position.|$|E
25|$|In February 1782, Princess Royal Battery was {{the site}} of the first use of Lieutenant George Koehler's {{depressing}} gun-carriage. This allowed the angle of the gun to be aimed down at an angle of seventy degrees. This enabled the defending soldiers {{to take advantage of the}} height of the Rock of Gibraltar. It was ingenius because the sliding carriage allowed the gun to recoil without sending the <b>gun</b> <b>carriage</b> into the air. This idea was later built into more conventional gun carriages. Colonel John Drinkwater in his accounts claimed that the gun hit its target 28 times out of 30 when aimed at the Spaniard's San Carlos Battery.|$|E

50|$|From the beginning, <b>gun</b> <b>carriages</b> {{had been}} stored at the Warren (unlike the guns {{themselves}} the wooden carriages {{had to be}} kept under cover). By the 1750s manufacture of <b>gun</b> <b>carriages</b> was also taking place on site, overseen by the Constructor of Carriages. This took place around New Carriage Yard (a low quadrangle of storehouses built alongside, and as an extension of, the Great Pile storehouses in 1728-9). In 1803 this activity was formalized as the Royal Carriage Department, {{a recognition of the}} importance of effective carriage design and manufacture, alongside that of guns and ammunition, as part of ordnance provision.|$|R
