500|$|The {{idea for}} the dinner party came from Oakley, who had {{wanted to have a}} party similar to the one in [...] "The War of the Simpsons". For {{the second half of the}} episode, Luann was {{redesigned}} to look more youthful and was given a new outfit. A big name singer was originally sought to sing [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>Borrow</b> a Feeling?" [...] over the end credits. The writers wanted Sheryl Crow, but she declined and the concept was later dropped.|$|E
6000|$|And I did [...] . {{as well as}} I could; for the Snark ate {{up money}} faster than I could earn it. In fact, every little while <b>I</b> had to <b>borrow</b> money with which to {{supplement}} my earnings. Now <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> one thousand dollars, now <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> two thousand dollars, and now <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> five thousand dollars. And all the time I went on working every day and sinking the earnings in the venture. I worked Sundays as well, and I took no holidays. But it was worth it. Every time I thought of the Snark I knew she was worth it.|$|R

2500|$|Outside literature, Lucas {{is remembered}} for his {{solution}} {{to one of}} the more contentious problems of ancient topography. His [...] "north-bank" [...] thesis on the location of the Battle of Pharsalus (48 B.C.), based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly and on a re-examination of the sources, dismissed a dozen previous theories and is now widely accepted by historians. [...] John D. Morgan in his definitive 'Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town' writes: [...] "My reconstruction is similar to Lucas’s, and in fact <b>I</b> <b>borrow</b> one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas’s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was not so}} savagely {{independent}} as to {{say anything}} in reply, but that if ever <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> money of anyone, <b>I</b> would <b>borrow</b> it of her. Next to accepting a large sum on the spot, I believe this gave Peggotty more comfort than anything I could have done.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nancy Shott," [...] said she, [...] "I don't know {{anything}} {{that makes me}} feel more at home than to hear you talk like that. You are the same woman that never could kiss a baby without wanting to spank it at the same time. I know what is the matter with you. You are thinking of that money <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> from your brother. Well, <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> that for a year, and the time is not up yet; but when it is, I'll pay it, every cent of it, and interest added. I knew what I was about when <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> it, and <b>I</b> know what I am about now, and if I get angry and pay it before it becomes due, he will lose that much interest, and he can charge it to you. That is all I have to say to you.|$|R

60|$|This {{fragment}} {{still standing}} {{used to be}} considered {{as part of the}} keep, but of late years better knowledge of the architecture of castles has led to the belief that {{it was part of the}} northern gateway tower. <b>I</b> <b>borrow</b> the description of the building from one written immediately after the comments of a gentleman who had studied the subject.|$|E
60|$|But for {{the moment}} it {{appeared}} to me a tremendous crisis, and I listened as the minister of justice read his communication, with a thrill which lost itself in the interest I suddenly felt in the plundered author. Those facile and brilliant phrases and ideas struck me as the finest things I had yet known in literature, and <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> the book and read it through. Then <b>I</b> <b>borrowed</b> another volume of Macaulay's essays, and another and another, till I had read them every one. It was like a long debauch, from which I emerged with regret that it should ever end.|$|R

6000|$|They {{are proud}} of this--as very well they may, [...] It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key [...] Stuck in their loins;[525] or like to an [...] "entré"[gx] [...] Up the back stairs, or such free-masonry.
