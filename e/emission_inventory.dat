40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} and urgency in quantifying the storage capacity of carbon sinks {{for inclusion in}} greenhouse gas (GHG) <b>emissions</b> <b>inventories</b> {{because of the need}} to quantify and reduce an organizationâ€™s carbon footprint. This is especially critical for entities with large areas of forested land, such as public agencies and land-based private companies, as the potentially significant amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere could be accounted for as a net reduction in an organizationâ€™s annual GHG emissions. Although there are relatively few examples to draw from for incorporating forest carbon sinks in an organizational level GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>inventory,</b> this paper provides timely guidance and concrete examples in the following three areas: best practices for calculating carbon sinks, recent developments in carbon sink guidance and U. S. reporting programs, and recommendations for including carbon sinks in an organizational GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>inventory.</b> Recent developments in U. S.

Besides minimising various pollution problems and lowering the risk of respiratory illnesses, noises and vibrations are also eliminated when no chemical combustion is involved as in the traditional engines.

40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{capabilities}} of a benchmarking system to identify inconsistencies in <b>emission</b> <b>inventories,</b> and to evaluate the reason behind discrepancies {{as a mean to}} improve both bottom-up and downscaled <b>emission</b> <b>inventories.</b> Fine scale bottom-up <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> for seven urban areas in Norway are compared with three regional <b>emission</b> <b>inventories,</b> EC 4 MACS, TNO_MACC-II and TNO_MACC-III, downscaled to the same areas. The comparison shows discrepancies in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) when evaluating both total and sectorial emissions. The three regional <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> underestimate NOx and PM 10 traffic emissions by approximately 20 e 80 % and 50 e 90 %, respectively. The main reasons for the underestimation of PM 10 emissions from traffic in the regional inventories are related to non-exhaust emissions due to resuspension, which are included in the bottom-up <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> but are missing in the official national emissions, and therefore in the downscaled regional inventories. The benchmarking indicates that the most probable reason behind the underestimation of NOx traffic emissions by the regional inventories is the activity data. The fine scale NOx traffic <b>emissions</b> from bottom-up <b>inventories</b> are based on the actual traffic volume at the road link and are much higher than the NOx emissions downscaled from national estimates based on fuel sales and based on population for the urban areas. We have identified important discrepancies in PM 2. 5 emissions from wood burning for residential heating among all the inventories. These discrepancies are associated with the assumptions made for the allocation of emissions. In the EC 4 MACs inventory, such assumptions imply high underestimation of PM 2. 5 emissions from the residential combustion sector in urban areas, which ranges from 40 to 90 % compared with the bottom-up inventories. The study shows that in three of the seven Norwegian cities there is need for further improvement of the <b>emission</b> <b>inventories.</b> JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|R
