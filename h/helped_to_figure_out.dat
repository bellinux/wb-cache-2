As regards the custom, this principle was shaped according to the religious and political contingencies, in order to recognize or deny any effects to customary rules. Different solutions were adopted {{with a view to}} maintaining social support towards the institutions: it was necessary to take into account both the popular spirit expressed abiding by the customs and the reactions of public opinion to the application or non-application of them. Innocent III <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the legal relevance of scandals, through the principle that it was essential to avoid at all costs dissents or oppositions in the Christian community: sometimes he uprooted the customs contrary to that of the Roman Church, which were considered dangerous to the unity of faith; other times he secured the application of the rites to which the population showed the greatest attachment. The policy of Innocent III urged, on this point, the remarks of the canonical doctrine: his decretals and the fourth Lateran council constitutions were utilized in the period of the great schism, in order to balance out the need both to maintain the unity within the Church and to respect the different ceremonial practices...|$|E

As modern processors are multi-core and tend to many cores, designing a CCL algorithm should address parallelism and multithreading. After a review of sequential CCL algorithms and a study of their variations, this paper presents the parallel version of the Light Speed Labeling for Connected Component Analysis (CCA) and compares it to our parallelized implementations of State-of-the-Art sequential algorithms. We provide some benchmarks that <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the intrinsic differences between these parallel algorithms. We show that thanks to its run-based processing, the LSL is intrinsically more efficient and faster than all pixel-based algorithms.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a dynamic model and analyzes its process that may plunge the business ecosystem into ToC (the Tragedy of the Commons).

The social commerce industry is a representative example {{of this type of}} industries, but the scope of this study {{is not limited to the}} industry. We first introduce a previous study focusing on the static Nash equilibrium, and then present an extended version of the basic model in a dynamic perspective. According to our analyses on the dynamic equilibria together with their stability, there may be a unique interior equilibrium, but it is highly likely unstable. In addition, possible (near) boundary equilibria are also unstable for a wide range of parameter values. We also conduct some numerical experiments and discover cycles as solutions to some particular instances. Since those cycles contain the ToC traps, a policy measure or regulation may need to be employed. Our approach and results will <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a clue <b>to</b> escape from the ToC trap, thereby shedding new light on the sustainable growth of the business ecosystem, which is prone to excessive marketing competition...|$|R
30|$|Altogether, six {{variables}} were included {{to test the}} theoretical explanations of overeducation. The age of individuals was used to proxy the entry-level workers effect (theoretical explanation number 1). ‘Breaks’ is a variable denoting the number of career breaks an individual has experienced. It {{was used to test}} the assumption that particular groups of workers with low bargaining power are more likely to experience overeducation (theoretical explanation number 2). Female workers as opposed to male workers, measured by the gender variable, also illustrate the same effect on overeducation. Theoretical explanation number 3 involves the role of ethnic discrimination. The categorical variable distinguishing between native, migrant, and second-generation migrant workers <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> this effect on overeducation. Survey respondents are asked whether they perceive to have career opportunities in the organisation they are presently working for. The response to this question was included to test theoretical explanation number 4. Although job allocation frictions due to the poor abilities of individual workers for the whole sample of workers (theoretical explanation 5) were not tested on the native population, this aspect was taken into consideration for the case of migrant workers. Workers with lower language abilities can proxy workers with poor individual abilities. Here, they are defined as migrant workers born in a country with a native language or a lingua franca that does not match that of the host country.|$|R

Methods: Utilizing in vitro cultured cell invasion assays with gentamicin-killing step, the invasive effects were analyzed in foodborne pathogens including Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Escherichia coli (E.  coli) O 157 and opportunistic pathogens Citrobacter in human embryonic intestine 407 cells and ileocecum HCT- 8 cells at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0. 04 – 4   000. 00 E.  coli HS served as a noninvasive control. Results: The study {{results showed that the}} bacterial invasive efficiency and the average number of internalized bacteria per host cell changed with different starting MOIs.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of AI {{applications}} should manage time varying information, for example, temporal databases, reservation systems, keeping medical records, financial applications, planning. Many published research articles {{in the area of}} temporal representation and reasoning assume that temporal data is precise and certain, even though in reality this assumption is often false. In many situations {{there is a need to}} know the relation between two temporal intervals, as it is, for example, during query processing. Indeterminacy means that we do not know exactly when a particular event happened. When two temporal intervals are indeterminate it is in many cases impossible to derive a certain temporal relation between them. In this paper we propose an approach to represent and estimate uncertain temporal relations by calculating the probabilities of the basic relations that can hold between two temporal primitives. We represent the relation between two temporal intervals as a matrix, four elements of which are the relations between the endpoints of these intervals. The uncertain relation between two temporal points is represented by a vector with three probability values denoting the probabilities of the basic relations (before, at the same time, after) between these points. The probabilities of Allen’s interval relations between two temporal intervals are composed as joint conditional probabilities of the correspondent relations between the endpoints of the intervals. We also consider an example of using the proposed estimation mechanism, which <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> possible application areas of the formalism...|$|R
