40|$|This paper aims {{to offer}} new {{estimates}} of <b>gainfully</b> <b>occupied</b> workers in Japan between 1885 and 1940. The estimates {{are made by}} taking explicitly widespread farm-family by-employment into account, {{and then they will}} be allocated into the primary, secondary and tertiary (PST) sectors. With the new workforce statistics and revised estimates of net output in the tertiary sector for the same period, we would also like to examine the levels of differentials in average labour productivity between the three sectors. The paper will show that labour productivity differentials between agriculture and manufacturing in early stages of Japan's industrialisation were not as wide as both Gerschenkronian and dual structurist arguments tended to assume for late industrialisers. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Successful {{return to}} work is {{regarded}} as one of the most important outcome factors for working-age post stroke patients. The present study will estimate the effect of various predictors on the odds of returning to work after stroke. Nearly twenty thousand 20 - 57 year-old stroke patients in Denmark who were <b>gainfully</b> <b>occupied</b> prior to the stroke will be included in the study. Methods/design Stroke patients will be followed prospectively through national registers. Multi-level logistic regression will be used to model the odds of being <b>gainfully</b> <b>occupied</b> ca. two years after the stroke as a function of the following predictors: Age (20 - 49 years, 50 - 57 years) gender, occupational class, self-employment (yes; no), onset calendar year (1996, 1997, [...] ., 2006), diagnosis (subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; cerebral infarction; stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction) and 'type of municipality' (the variable is set to 1 if the person lived in a municipality which had a brain injury rehabilitation centre at the time of the stroke. Otherwise it is set to 0). Municipalities will be treated as the subjects while individual observations within municipalities are treated as correlated repeated measurements. Discussion Since our follow-up is done through registers and all people in the target population are included, the study is free from sampling bias, recall bias and non-response bias. The study is also strengthened by its size. The major weakness of the study is that it does not contain any stroke severity measures. Thus, it cannot accurately predict whether a particular stroke patient will in fact {{return to work}}. The study is, however, quite useful from a public health perspective. It can be used to estimate the proportion of patients in a certain group that is expected to return to work, and thereby provide a comparison material, which e. g. municipalities can use to evaluate their success in returning their stroke patients to work. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The paper {{analyzes}} the characteristics {{and evolution of}} income distribution in the Brazilian agricultural sector, comparing it with the overall distribution or with the non-agricultural sector, considering two dimensions: the per capita household income and the income of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons.</b> The main data source is the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD). In order to fulfill this purpose, the per capita household income was divided into nine components (for Brazil and considering only the agricultural households) to evaluate {{their contributions to the}} decrease in inequality. In the second part, the paper {{analyzes the}} characteristics of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> and the determining factors of their income, always comparing the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. The estimated effects were analyzed over the period 1992 - 2012, adjusting one earnings equation for each year. In both cases (per capita household income and earnings of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons),</b> the agricultural sector showed a markedly different behavior. Regarding the per capita household income, though from 2001 to 2009 the rate of reduction in inequality among agricultural households is similar to the one observed in Brazil as a whole, the determinants associated with this reduction are clearly different in the agricultural sector. Concerning the income of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons,</b> the reduction in inequality is less intense and more irregular in the agricultural sector. The various factors that determin...|$|R

40|$|From {{a simple}} {{observation}} of data it arises that when bigger the "per capita" income {{of a nation}} is, lesser the participation of agricultural section will be, in national product.

The fundamental question is to know up to what degree should industrialization be supported, and {{which is the most}} economic value for agricultural production volume.

40|$|Earnings {{equations}} for <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> in {{the state}} of Minas Gerais are estimated using data from the 2000 Demographic Census of Brazil. Such equations allow us to evaluate the effect of age, gender, schooling, color (race), position in the occupation, weekly working time and other factors on earnings, taking into account as well the differences among 12 regions of the state. Data limitations are discussed, particularly the understatement of incomes, and the composition of household income is also analyzed. Regarding the specification of the earnings equations, the paper shows that it is wrong to assume that the influence of schooling can be represented as a linear function, since there is an important threshold effect after 10 years of schooling. The paper also shows that there are important differences among earnings equations fitted {{for each of the three}} economic sectors. In agriculture, for instance, the most relevant variable explaining differences in earnings of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> is their position in occupation, and not schooling, while in industry and services the main explanatory variable is schooling. earnings equations, inequality, education, Brazil, Minas Gerais...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistic}} used in Table 1 is {{the number}} of males who finished their education at the primary level as a percentage of number of males <b>gainfully</b> <b>occupied</b> on farms of different sizes. Hence the higher the percentage the lower the level of education. The national average level for males was 66. 3 percent; the second last row of the table shows that, except for sons etc assisting, percentages in agriculture were substantially in excess of this latter figure. Column 2 shows that it is only at the 100 - 200 acre class that male farmers approach the national average. The farmer and relative percentages improve with farm size but appreciably only at the large farm sizes. Percentages for agricultural labourers decline only slightly with farm size; of course, employees are numerous only on large farms. It can scarcely be said that the larger farmers have better educated workers, though {{there seems to be a}} slight effect. Educationally the male farming class make a poor showing, by the simple test used. About the most cheerful prospect in the lower percentage for sons compared with farmers; but the improvement will take a generation for full effect. That the table shows such regularity is statistically satisfactory. One can draw inferences from it without much qualification. In these comparisons, however, present (i. e. 1966) age is of the essence, as numbers with post-primary experience are increasing all the time we expect sons' percentages to be lower than fathers'.

5|$|The Australian Government {{considered}} deploying pilots from 805 Squadron {{to fight}} in Vietnam during 1967 and 1968. On 12 May 1967, the Naval Board recommended to the Government that six Skyhawk pilots and their ground crew be offered to the US Navy during May the next year after these personnel had completed their training on the new aircraft. This decision was motivated {{by a desire to}} keep the pilots <b>gainfully</b> <b>occupied</b> while Melbourne completed her refit, and would not involve deploying the A-4Gs as they lacked the weapons systems and avionics needed to counter North Vietnamese air defences. As part of the initial consideration of this option, the Minister for Air suggested that the Australian Skyhawks could be sent to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand to relieve the CAC Sabre-equipped No. 79 Squadron RAAF stationed there, but such a deployment was found to be impractical. The Government's Defence Committee subsequently recommended that FAA fighter pilots be attached to a United States Marine Corps (USMC) unit stationed at Chu Lai Air Base and conduct combat missions over South Vietnam. While the USMC Skyhawk units frequently attacked targets in North Vietnam, the FAA aircrew were to be prohibited from joining these operations as the Government had previously decided to restrict Australia's war effort to South Vietnam. This plan was announced by Prime Minister Harold Holt in October 1967 as part of a package of Australian reinforcements to the war effort in Vietnam. In the event, the deployment did not proceed as the delays to 805 Squadron's initial Skyhawk conversion course meant that the pilots were not ready until after Melbourne re-entered service. The Navy assessed {{that it would not be}} possible to both man a fighter squadron on the carrier and post pilots to Vietnam, and delaying the reactivation of Melbournes air group could lead to criticism of the Skyhawk acquisition. In February 1969 the Minister for Defence directed that no further consideration was to be given to sending naval fighter pilots to Vietnam.|$|R
