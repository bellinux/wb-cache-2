40|$|Introduction : Clinical {{education}} is considered {{as the heart}} of medicine and health care due {{to the importance of}} training expert manpower. To achieve this goal, education quality should be promoted, this requiring its continuous evaluation. In this regard, application of appropriate educational strategies by competent clinical trainers or instructors leads to an improvement in the clinical education outcomes. This study was carried out to assess the learning method of clinical skills and <b>its</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>from</b> the viewpoint of students of midwifery. Materials & Methods : This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 140 employed BS midwives in Yazd Province who had a 6 -month working experience using a questionnaire including demographic information and items on the common clinical skills grading, skills learning methods, and barriers to clinical learning. Having collected the questionnaires, the data were analyzed using SPSS. Results : The findings of the study revealed that the rate of clinical skills was at a good level for most of the subjects (56. 5 %), at an intermediate level for 30. 7 %, and at a low level for 12. 8 % of the subjects. The correlation coefficients were statistically significant between subjects' level of clinical skills and age, department, and clinical experience. In studying the learning methods of clinical skills, 46. 6 % of learning was attributed to trainers, while 69. 3 % of the learning barriers were attributed to lack of sufficient cases during education, and 68. 6 % were attributed to insufficient practical training. Conclusion : Although the graduates had an acceptable level of clinical skills, the need for improving clinical education and administering continuous education programs for controlling and warranting care quality was markedly obvious. As the subjects reported, learning was attributed to trainers, while learning barriers were attributed to lack of sufficient cases during training, and insufficient practical training. Thus, through balancing student uptake, society needs, and the present educational means, we hope to see the promotion of care quality some day...|$|E

40|$|Tunneling electroresistance (TER) {{effect is}} {{the change in the}} {{electrical}} resistance of a ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) associated with polarization reversal in the ferroelectric barrier layer. Here we predict that a FTJ with a composite barrier that combines a functional ferroelectric film and a thin layer of a non-polar dielectric can exhibit a significantly enhanced TER. Due to the change in the electrostatic potential with polarization reversal the non-polar dielectric barrier acts as a switch that changes <b>its</b> <b>barrier</b> height <b>from</b> a low to high value. The predicted values of TER are giant and indicate that the resistance of the FTJ can be changed by many orders in magnitude at the coercive electric field of ferroelectric.

Lioren speaks to the terminally ill Dr. Mannen, {{eventually}} reviving Mannen's interest in life. Lioren also offers encouragement to the isolated alien Khone (see Star Healer.) Next he is asked {{to speak to a}} gigantic Groalterri, whose race is so advanced they have until now refused all contact with the federated planets. The humans are desperate to make any sort of progress with this race, but the Groalterri patient won't communicate with anyone. Bit by bit, Lioren shares his own guilty history and talks the suicidal alien into lowering <b>its</b> emotional <b>barriers.</b> <b>From</b> <b>its</b> story he manages to figure out the Groalterri's hitherto unknown injury and arrange surgery that will change its life. Finally, at the end, Lioren meets with the handful of Cromsag survivors.|$|R
40|$|Resolvins are a novel {{class of}} lipid {{mediators}} that {{play an important}} role in the resolution of inflammation, although the underlying mechanisms are not very clear. To explore the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of resolvins, we have studied the effects of resolvin D 1 (RvD 1) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced endothelial barrier disruption as it is linked to propagation of inflammation. We found that LPS induces endothelial cell (EC) barrier disruption via xanthine oxidase (XO) -mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2 inactivation and Fyn-related kinase (Frk) activation leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of α-catenin and VE-cadherin and their dissociation from each other affecting adherens junction (AJ) integrity and thereby increasing endothelial barrier permeability. RvD 1 attenuated LPS-induced AJ disassembly and endothelial barrier permeability by arresting tyrosine phosphorylation of α-catenin and VE-cadherin and their dislocation from AJ via blockade of XO-mediated ROS production and thereby suppression of SHP 2 inhibition and Frk activation. We have also found that the protective effects of RvD 1 on EC barrier function involve ALX/FPR 2 and GPR 32 as inhibition or neutralization of these receptors negates its protective effects. LPS also increased XO activity, SHP 2 cysteine oxidation and its inactivation, Frk activation, α-catenin and VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation and their dissociation from each other leading to AJ disruption with increased vascular permeability in mice arteries and RvD 1 blocked all these effects. Thus, RvD 1 protects endothelial AJ and <b>its</b> <b>barrier</b> function <b>from</b> disruption by inflammatory mediators such as LPS via a mechanism involving the suppression of XO-mediated ROS production and blocking SHP 2 inactivation...|$|R

To ensure the collaborative relationships effectiveness and success each company should has {{clear understanding of the}} purpose of collaboration including <b>its</b> <b>barriers.</b> This paper is trying to review and identify various factors of collaboration <b>barriers</b> <b>from</b> previous research and published papers. From our review it was revealed that collaboration contributed a number of benefits in business such as reduce cost of production, increase quality of products, increase market of products and finally increase share values of the companies. Nevertheless, collaboration in business can be failed due to three important barriers due to interpersonal characteristics, organizational characteristics and individual characteristics. Specifically lack of trust, lack of communication and poor return on investment in collaborative engagement were the factors of collaboration barriers discovered in this paper...|$|R
