40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{consumption}} of <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> may have serious implications when developing complex {{tasks such as}} the driving of motor vehicles. The maximum alcohol levels in exhaled air –when driving– are established at 0, 15 mg/L (considering new and professional drivers) and 0, 25 mg/L (for {{the rest of the}} population) in Spain. JUSTIFICATION: Due to the high number of damage caused by traffic accidents in which drivers under the effects of <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> are involved, this area of research has attracted the interest of researchers and led them to analyze the possible differences of exploration and visual acuity of those drivers that show a higher <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> level than permitted by the law (either > 0, 25 mg/L in exhaled air or its equivalent of 0, 5 g/L in blood), as indicated by E. Villanueva Cañada in the treatise on "Legal Medicine and Toxicology" [...] Gisbert Calabuig (2004). HYPOTHESIS: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether the ingestion of alcohol in dose of ≤ 0, 25 mg/L in exhaled air has effects on the visual system and the reaction capacity in subjects that undergo simulated driving tests and their ability to react to different stimuli. OBJECTIVES: Since there may exist an individual susceptibility that causes that effects of <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> at the levels allowed by the regulation in Spain to be variable, the intention of this research is to examine its influence on the driving of motor vehicles based on diverse parameters of cognitive (reaction capacity) and visual function (visual acuity and pupil response) [...] ...|$|E

ABSTRACT Evaluation of alcoholic attractants in a handmade trap {{for monitoring}} {{and control of the}} coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) This assay was based on the need of developing strategies to control the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) affordable by farmers. In the locality of Caspo, Lara State, Venezuela, the capture of adults of the insect using handmade traps constructed with soft drink disposable plastic bottles was evaluated in a completely randomized test with four repetitions and the following eight attractants: mix of methylic (M) and <b>ethylic</b> (E) <b>alcohols</b> at 1 : 1 ratio; mix of M and E at 3 : 1; mix of M, E and coffee powder at 1 : 1 : 1; isopropilic alcohol (I); mix of M, E and I at 1 : 1 : 1; Agave cocuy liquor; sugar cane liquor; and coffee pulp vinegar. The greater captures of adults occurred in the treatments that included mixes of methyl and ethyl alcohol, but lacking isopropilic alcohol with averages above 400 adults/trap/week, being significantly higher than the rest of treatments. A second assay established with those three treatments to determine the best height to position the traps in the coffee plantation did not show differences between the two evaluated heights of 0. 2 and 1. 0 m. The use of these traps using attractants containing mixes of methylic and <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohols</b> placed between 0. 2 and 1. 0 m may be an option for controlling the coffee berry borer at high infested plantations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the benefits of sugar cane ethanol in Brazil, appointing the productivity of this type of fuel based on hectares of plantation, its carbon dioxide cycle and the contribution to reduce the greenhouse effect. In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and <b>ethylic</b> and anhydric <b>alcohol,</b> Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen. Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration. One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratinguetá, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses.

In practice, the cycle is modified by inserting a hydrophobic Membrane Contactor {{in order to make a}} liquid-liquid extraction of a solute easily absorbed in water (solvent). In this way, the classical absorption cycle can be modified with the complete elimination of heat supply, used to separate the solute from solvent, replacing it with the pump work necessary to pressurize and circulate the fluids involved in the cycle. This is enabled because the separation of the two fluids in the Contactor Membrane is obtained thanks to a generation of a concentration gradient. The adopted membrane contactor, commercially available, is realized by means of hollow porous fiber of polypropylene (PP) positioned in an cartridge of polyethylene (PE). The concentration gradient is realized between the two size of the membrane, i. e. water at high concentration of the solute and the other size in which an organic solvent flows at low concentration of the solute. As secondary fluid, organic solvent, we adopted and tested diesel oil. The result demonstrates the technical feasibility of the proposed cycle through some preliminary results obtained adopting <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> and acetaldehyde, both of them absorbed by water...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} assess the effect of acute alcohol intake on ischemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) in humans using the clinical model of 2 sequential balloon inflations during a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Ischemic preconditioning is the most potent form of endogenous myocardial protection from irreversible ischemic injury. Experimental observations suggest that acute ethanol administration might abolish IPC. METHODS: We studied 30 consecutive patients (22 men, mean age 65 years) undergoing elective coronary angioplasty who were randomized to receive an oral dose of 40 g <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> (administered as 149 ml of Gordon's Gin) or 149 ml of water 30 min before PCI. Intracoronary electrocardiogram was continuously monitored to assess the greatest ST-segment elevation or depression from baseline. RESULTS: In placebo-treated patients, the change of ST-segment shift during the second inflation was significantly smaller than that during the first inflation (19. 3 +/- 9. 1 vs. 15. 7 +/- 8. 7, p = 0. 005). In contrast, in gin-treated patients, the change of ST-segment shift during the second inflation was significantly greater than that during the first inflation (18. 7 +/- 7. 2 vs. 22 +/- 10, p = 0. 03). The group-inflation interaction for ST-segment changes was highly significant (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized, prospective study in humans shows that administration of a moderate dose of ethanol abolishes IPC occurring during sequential episodes of myocardial ischemia and is associated with worsening ischemia. Based on our study, intake of moderate to high doses of alcoholic beverages should be avoided in patients {{at high risk of}} acute myocardial infarction...|$|E

40|$|Fourteen hard palates of neotropical {{primates}} {{were studied}} (Cebus apella), fixed on formaldehyde (10 %) and preserved in <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> (70 %), collected {{according to the}} International Bioethics Committee. The animals were supplied by the Medicine College Veterinary Medicine and Zootecnica of the University of São Paulo in 1994. They originated from the São Paulo Zoo. They had died naturally. Measurement (in centimeters) of the viscerocranium (8 adults and 6 young animals) was made, including palatine length (PL), interpremolar distance (ID), intermolar distance (ID), interorbital distance (IDi), and midface height (MH). The palatine anatomy showed complete right crests (7. 64 to 1. 22), complete left crests (8. 07 to 1. 71), incomplete right crests (1. 71 to 1. 43), and incomplete left crests (1. 64 to 1. 3). The diasten between the lateral incisive teeth was the main anatomical landmark for the anterior end of the crest, and the landmark for the posterior end was the second molar teeth for all the specimens. The palate is very peculiar: mild concave, from the dental arcade to the median line, covered by the non-pigmented mucous tissue, with osseous structure composed of horizontal layers of the maxilar and palatine bones; sub mucous tissue attached to the periosteum and mucous tissue showing relatively prominent palatine crests. The crests appear as a rigid elevation of the mucous tissue, with some variations at the antimers. It may be concluded that {{the length of the}} hard palate is strongly related to the maturity of the animal, relative to the interorbital distance, and that the latter is also related to the length of the palate and the labial opening...|$|E
40|$|Aveloz (firestick cactus; Euphorbia tirucalli L.) {{belongs to}} Euphorbiaceae family, {{characterized}} by {{the production of a}} toxic latex that has corrosive effects on the skin and mucous membranes. Continual topic use of the latex is recommended by popular medicine to treat warts, and epitheliomas. To validate this indication, ultra diluted latex and homeopathic medicine Euphorbia tirucalli were tested in vitro on the proliferation of melanoma cells. Ultra diluted latex was prepared in homeopathic dilutions 5 cH, 15 cH and 30 cH by dilution and agitation (trituration for solid and sucussion for liquid phases) using 70 Ã‚Âº GL (Gay Lussac) <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> (70 Ã‚Âº GL EtOH 70 Ã‚ÂºGL) as inert medium according to the guidelines in FarmacopÃƒÂ©ia HomeopÃƒÂ¡tica Brasileira (FHB). Homeopathic medicine Euphorbia tirucalli was prepared from mother-tincture according to the centesimal Hahnemannian method. Solutions 0. 5 % and 5 % of 70 Ã‚ÂºGL EtOH were succussed and used as control. Human melanoma cells were cultured, treated and monitored by method MTT for 24 to 72 hours. It was observed that 0. 5 % 70 Ã‚ÂºGL EtOH solution had little or no effect on the proliferation of melanoma cells (5. 1 % maximal inhibition in dilution 30 cH). Positive correlation was observed in most groups between inhibition of proliferation and diluted preparations, maximal increase (9 %) was seen in with 5 % latex. Moreover, mother-tincture proved to be more active than latex; treatment with 0. 5 % solution of latex 30 cH exhibited 19. 7 % inhibition, whereas treatment with 0. 5 % solution of Euphorbia tirucalli 30 cH exhibited 32. 1 % inhibition of cell proliferation (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that high dilutions of firestick cactus (especially dilution 30 cH) might have a therapeutic indication in melanoma, further studies are needed in this regard...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the stages and the operations {{involved in the}} preservation and restoration of two icons on wooden support, from the XIX-th century, which {{are part of the}} heritage of the ”Sfinții Arhangheli Mihail and Gavriil” church, from Galați. The two icon have inventory numbers as part of the collection as followed: 112 for the first icon and 113 for the second one. Both icons have the same theme, ”The Grieving Mother from Rohia” and are made by anonymous painters in egg tempera, on lime wooden support, without ground. Being part of the same collection, they were deposited in the same place and as a direct consequence, they suffer from similar deteriorations and degradations that affect both the support and the painting layer. Both panels are attacked by xylophagous insects and the painting layer has detachments, gaps, cracks, clogged dirt and a cracked and degraded varnish layer. Ten samples taken from the already detached areas were analyzed by optical microscope, SEM-EDX and micro-FTIR. Based on the chemical elements identified in the EDX spectrums, the pigments used to create the painting layer are: ultramarine natural blue Na 8 - 10 Al 6 Si 6 O 24 S 2 - 4, carbon black, earth green, K[(Al,FeIII),(FeII,Mg) ](AlSi 3,Si 4) O 10 (OH) 2, ocher (FeO), burned or natural umber Fe 2 O 3 · H 2 O + MnO 2 ·n H 2 O+ Al 2 O 3, lead white (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) and yellow iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 · 4 H 2 O). It was also determined that the gold leaf usually used in byzantine icons was replaced in the case of both icons: the icon number 112 has silver leaf covered with varnish, while the halo of the icon number 113 was created with yellow metallic pigments (realgar or orpigment). The pigments were also identified by determining specific peaks in micro-FTIR spectrums. For natural ultramarine blue the peaks between 628 - 724 cm- 1 were assigned; the peaks in the interval 795 - 887 cm- 1 confirm the presence of carbonates (calcium and lead based). The earth green pigment (aluminum - silicates) had the peaks between 1464 - 1599, while the carbon black pigment was confirmed by the peaks in the interval 921 - 1060 cm- 1. After the pigments and the materials used by the author were identified, the restoration process begun with the following stages: consolidation of the painting layer (fish glue 8 % and japanese paper), stopping the xylophagous attack (encapsulation with nitrogen), consolidation of the wood supports (colophon and wax, 1 : 1), cleaning the painting layer (<b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> and distilled water, 1 : 1), filling the gaps and reintegrating the fillings in tratteggio, all followed by the process of varnishing the two icons...|$|E

Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia QuímicaEste trabalho teve como objetivo {{principal}} estudar a imobilização de lipase comercial (Lipozyme CALB L) em esferas de quitosana funcionalizadas com várias concentrações de glutaraldeído e avaliar a melhor concentração para posterior imobilização. Constatou-se que a concentração de 3 % (v/v) foi a que proporcionou a enzima maior estabilidade e conferiu a mesma maior atividade residual. A atividade enzimática da CALB L também foi determinada em vários valores de pH (3, 0; 5, 0; 6, 0; 7, 0; 8, 0; 9, 0 e 10, 0) e de temperaturas (30 a 100 oC), onde foi possível observar que o melhor pH foi o valor de pH 9, 0 tanto para a CALB L imobilizada covalentemente em esferas de quitosana e de Novozym 435 imobilizada em resina macroporosa. A temperatura que conferiu a CALB L e Novozym 435 maior atividade enzimática foi a de 90 oC. A segunda etapa do trabalho envolveu o uso das enzimas caracterizadas na transesterificação enzimática do óleo de mamona comercial com álcool etílico 95 oGL, onde foram realizados ensaios em que se avaliaram a reação com razão molar de 3 : 1 (álcool etílico: óleo de mamona), com 3 % de enzima imobilizada, sem a presença de solvente orgânico, obtendo-se valores de conversão de ésteres etílicos superiores a 90 %. Dessa forma, foi possível verificar que existe a viabilidade do uso de enzimas imobilizadas na produção de biodiesel de mamona sem o uso de solventes orgânicos derivados do petróleo. This {{work had}} as main objective {{to study the}} commercial immobilization of lipase (Lipozyme CALB L) in spheres of chitosan with different glutaraldehyde concentrations and evaluate the best concentration for posterior immobilization. The results suggested that the concentration of 3 % (v/v) {{was the one that}} afforded the highest enzyme stability and also conferred greater residual activity. The enzymatic activity of CALB L was also determined in different pH values (3. 0; 5. 0; 6. 0; 7. 0; 8. 0; 9. 0 and 10. 0) and temperatures (30 to 100 oC), where was observed that the best pH value was 9. 0, both for immobilized CALB L with crosslinking in chitosan spheres and immobilized Novozym 435 in macroporous resin. The temperature that conferred both CALB L and Novozym 435 the greater enzymatic activity was 100 oC. The second phase of the work involved the use of enzymes characterized at the enzymatic transesterification of the commercial castor oil with <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> 95 oGL, where the assays had been carried out evaluating the reaction with molar ratio of 3 : 1 (alcohol: castor oil), with 3 % of immobilized enzyme, at the absence of the organic solvent, obtaining values of ethylic esters conversion up to 90 %. In this way, it was possible to verify the viability for the use of immobilized enzyme in the production of biodiesel from castor oil without the use of organic solvents derived from petroleum...|$|E

Therefore, by accusing information related to fauna leeches of each area a risk factor {{from the viewpoint of}} the possibility of being or accusing transferred diseases by these leeches, one can predict and forehand about them. Freshwater leeches of Iran to present accurate recognition (morphological, molecular) have not been, and there are some limited reports from {{different parts of the country}} about them. One of the areas that its leeches have not been identified yet is Kurdistan, By having five latrines and big permanent rivers and 32000 springs and a lot of deep and semi-deep wells and this province is a convenient bed for growing aquatics in the country. Therefore, identifying risk factors for development of aquaculture on water resources is one important factor to access achieving development goals. For recognizing leeches of this province, some samples from 10 stands were token. Samples from under stones, sticking to the fish, turtles, plants and solid substances in the water were separated and after recording their physical characteristics, calming with 10 % <b>ethylic</b> <b>alcohol</b> with 10 % formalin become fixed and after painting with Carmen acetic acid by standard keys for 7 species of Helobdella stagnalis, Placobdella costata, Hemiclepsis marginata, Erpobdella octoculata, Hirudo medicinalis, Dina lineate lineata have been identified and described. Which Helobdella stagnalis has the highest distribution in the province and the minimum one is Hirudo medicinalis. However, that the data obtained in leeches in Kurdistan is a relatively complete collection in this research, recognizing fauna of these areas needs more studying. The Placobdella costata and Hemiclepsis marginata sticking to the fish were separated among identified species which showed that these are parasites for the fish. The sticking area of those leeches to the skin was accompanied with scales cast, damage to mucous membranes beneath the parasite and bleeding Was associated with Histopathology studying effect includes observing break and disconnection in the leech connecting place to the epithelial layer of epidermis in the skin, destroyed nucleus in skin Epithelial cells with observing necrosis in ulcerative place become of the leech and the sub acute inflammated penetration until acute necrosis with opening in Dermis layer is observable. Kidney of this fish have changes such as: proliferation, like proliferative kidney disease with increasing proliferative glomerular cells and increasing in membranous cells in Capillary corpuscle, observing necrotic cells in haematopoietic tissue of kidney along with increasing in infiltration of leukocyte's cells generally mono nucluars such as lymphocytes and less poly morpho nucluars such as neutrophiles that are symptoms of disorders causing anemia become of nourishing and sucking blood by the leech and creating a chronic kidney infection that originally root is in another place like the skin. Also Hemorrhagic anemia causes losing RBC's is because of using the host blood by the leech. (In this situation, one can see immature RBC red cells in Peripheral blood. To identify potential carriers of the leech to the viruses, after finding them in recorded stands and putting them in 75 % ethanol for viruses cause IPN, VHS, IHN, they were tested by PCR that the conclusion of these experiments approved IPN virus in Hemiclepsis marginata and Hirudo medicinalis. This kind of leeches can act like a mechanical carrier and causing spreading the agent of this disease. It is worth mentioning that studying the pathogenicity of this virus for aquaculture sources, mentioned before needs more research. During the study of infected fish with leeches that was done after preparing bloody slides and staining them, no case blood parasites was observed. During a research about infecting fish experimentally to known leeches it become clear that 5 days after being in aquarium including leeches, samples of sticking Hirudo medicinalis leech to the golden carp with scales cast were observed. Including leeches to the fish started with molting the scales in the sticking area in the fish and fish become too uneasy and by rubbing themselves to the malls and things inside the aquarium, tried to separate them. Finally, after around 30 hours, leeches penetrate the skin, feeding from blood and tissue liquids and cause mortality the fish and then they become separated from them. If the corpse of these fish stayed in the aquarium, the Helobdella stagnalis and Erpobdella octoculata would start feeding them...|$|E
