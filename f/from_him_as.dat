5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb to the {{darkness}} again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E
