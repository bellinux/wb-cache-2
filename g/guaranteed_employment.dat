5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was <b>guaranteed</b> <b>employment.</b> However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

Without reform, according to Gingrich, this will cause major financial problems, such as large benefit reductions or massive tax increases. In order to avoid these outcomes, Gingrich supports {{what he calls a}} [...] "replacement approach" [...] to entitlement reform. He argues that entitlement programs need fundamental restructuring in order to strengthen incentives for work and productivity. Gingrich cites the reform of Aid to Families with Dependent Children passed in the 1990s as a model for future policymaking. Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty. He has proposed replacing these systems with an offer of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>employment</b> for the able-bodied, preferably in the private sector to save taxpayer money, or retraining. Beneficiaries who work enough hours would receive Medicare vouchers and housing assistance.|$|E

The paper concludes that in countries with liberal regimes such as the United States, systems and policies emphasize the creation of a greater range of choices for employees, while in countries with social democratic regimes (northern European countries) and countries with corporatist regimes (continental European countries), systems and policies emphasize the <b>guarantee</b> of <b>employment,</b> attempting to ensure that employees do not lose their jobs. It is also indicated that when the latter countries attempt to <b>guarantee</b> <b>employment</b> by means of employment protection systems, a discrepancy is created between unemployment among the younger generation and employment among the current working generation, and this ultimately restricts the autonomy of employees...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} <b>employment</b> <b>guarantees</b> when labor markets are imperfect and when the credibility of government policy announcements could be in doubt. The basic feature of an EGS is that any individual who satisfies a set of specified criteria is <b>guaranteed</b> public <b>employment</b> at a given wage if they want it. Thus, the two factors that define the guarantee are the wage and the ease of access. The problem for the planner is to choose these to maximize a social welfare function. If the labour market is perfectly competitive, then the introduction of an <b>employment</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme is bound to have efficiency costs, and can only be justified through its positive distributional consequences – {{this has been the}} framework for most of the theoretical and empirical analysis of <b>employment</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes. If the labor market is imperfect, however, the announcement of a credible <b>employment</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme can improve efficiency through the introduction of contestability in the private labour market. The paper then considers the issue of credibility and solves for an incentive compatible <b>employment</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme in a rational expectations equilibrium. It is shown that the outcome with a planner who cares only about efficiency can be less efficient than the outcome with a planner whose social welfare function also gives weight to poverty!credibility; employment guarantees; employment targeting; poverty aversion...|$|R
