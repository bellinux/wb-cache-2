5|$|While {{the society}} is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E

25|$|The PRC has {{consistently}} claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC {{is no longer}} in legitimate existence. Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence, though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal. The PRC has threatened {{the use of military force}} in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible.|$|E

500|$|Among {{conservative}} and neoconservative {{critics in the}} United States, The Power of Nightmares {{has been described as}} [...] "conspiracy theory", anti-American or both. David Asman of FoxNews.com said, [...] "We wish we didn't have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they keep pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity." [...] His views were shared by commentator Clive Davis, ending his commentary on the film for National Review by saying, [...] "British producers, hooked on Chomskyite visions of 'Amerika' as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth." [...] Other commentators have variously described the film as pushing a conspiracy theory. Davis and British commentator David Aaronovitch both explicitly labelled the film's message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis [...] "his argument is as subtle as a house-brick." [...] Attacks in this vein continued after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, with the Christian Broadcasting Network referencing the film as a source for claims by the [...] "British left" [...] that [...] "the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud", and the Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council calling it [...] "the loopiest, most extreme anti-war documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC." [...] In The Shadows in the Cave, Curtis emphasises that he does not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, but that the threat of terrorism had been greatly exaggerated. He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory by saying he believes the alleged use of fear as a force <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film [...] "have stumbled on it." ...|$|E

Netanyahu describes Berlusconi as [...] " [...] one of the greatest friends". Berlusconi believed that Israel should be made an EU member, stating that [...] "My greatest desire, as long as I am a protagonist <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> <b>is</b> to bring Israel into membership of the European Union". Berlusconi has strongly defended Israel in its conflict with the Palestinians, continuing his support for Israel after leaving office.|$|E

A writer is free inside that area, but woe {{to the man}} who goes beyond it, not that he stands in fear of an inquisition, but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution. A career <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys." [...] Tocqueville, in contrast to previous political thinkers, argued that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong, but that people were [...] "too weak" [...] and felt powerless; the danger is that people felt [...] "swept up in something that they could not control", according to Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{not only}} in discussions of the [...] "labor situation" [...] that we hear this eternal babble of [...] "principles."

6000|$|Ibid. July 22.—The {{separation}} from friends <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> indeed [...] very painful.... I have been instructed, perhaps been hardened, by [...] {{a very wide}} experience in separation.—No man has been blessed more [...] {{out of proportion to}} his deserts than I have in friends: in [...] πολυφιλία, in χρηστοφιλία;(102) but when with regard to those of [...] old standing who were nearest to me, I ask where are they, I seem [...] to see around me a little waste, that has been made by politics, [...] by religion, and by death. All these modes of severance are sharp. [...] But the first of them is the least so, when the happy conviction [...] remains that the fulfilment of duty, such as conscience points to [...] it, is the object on both sides. And I have suffered so sorely by [...] the far sharper partings in death, and in religion after a fashion [...] which practically almost comes to death, that there is something [...] of relief in turning to the lighter visitation. It is, however, a [...] visitation still.|$|E
60|$|All this, I {{know well}} enough, will sound wild and chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and {{mechanical}} politicians {{who have no}} place among us: a sort {{of people who think}} that nothing exists but what is gross and material,--and who, therefore, far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine. But to men truly initiated and rightly taught, these ruling and master principles, which in the opinion of such men as I have mentioned have no substantial existence, are in truth everything, and all in all. Magnanimity <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> not seldom the truest wisdom; and a great empire and little minds go ill together. If we are conscious of our situation, and glow with zeal to fill our place as becomes our station and ourselves, we ought to auspicate all our public proceedings on America with the old warning of the Church, Sursum corda! We ought to elevate our minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order of Providence has called us. By adverting to the dignity of this high calling our ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious empire, and have made the most extensive and the only honorable conquests, not by destroying, but by promoting the wealth, the number, the happiness of the human race. Let us get an American revenue as we have got an American empire. English privileges have made it all that it is; English privileges alone will make it all it can be.|$|E
6000|$|Be sparing of commands. Command {{only when}} other means are inapplicable, or have failed. [...] "In {{frequent}} orders the parents' advantage is more considered than the child's," [...] says Richter. As in primitive societies {{a breach of}} law is punished, {{not so much because}} it is intrinsically wrong as because it is a disregard of the king's authority--a rebellion against him; so in many families, the penalty visited on a transgressor is prompted less by reprobation of the offence than by anger at the disobedience. Listen to the ordinary speeches--"How dare you disobey me?" [...] "I tell you I'll make you do it, sir." [...] "I'll soon teach you who is master"--and then consider what the words, the tone, and the manner imply. A determination to subjugate is far more conspicuous in them, than anxiety for the child's welfare. For the time being the attitude of mind differs but little from that of a despot bent on punishing a recalcitrant subject. The right-feeling parent, however, like the philanthropic legislator, will rejoice not in coercion, but in dispensing with coercion. He will do without law wherever other modes of regulating conduct can be successfully employed; and he will regret the having recourse to law when law is necessary. As Richter remarks--"The best rule <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> said to be 'pas trop gouverner:' it is also true in education." [...] And in spontaneous conformity with this maxim, parents whose lust of dominion is restrained by a true sense of duty, will aim to make their children control themselves as much as possible, and will fall back upon absolutism only as a last resort.|$|E
