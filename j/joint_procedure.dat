30|$|The <b>joint</b> <b>procedure</b> {{presented}} in this article, which couples the Newmark model and the Rockfall Analyst model based on a GIS platform, is helpful for the regional quantitative risk identification of seismic landslide impacts on specific infrastructure.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} level of {{agreement}} between self-reported and hospital administration records of arthritis related surgeries for two large samples of community dwelling older women in Australia, born between 1921 - 1926 and 1946 - 1951. Study Design and Setting: Self-report survey data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) was linked to inpatient hospital data from the New South Wales Admitted Patient Data Collection (NSW APDC). Levels of agreement were compared using Cohen’s kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Reasons for false positives were examined.

30|$|This article {{presents}} a <b>joint</b> <b>procedure</b> that couples the regional probability model of Newmark {{and the physical}} RockFall Analyst model. These tools {{can be used to}} analyze the seismic landslide occurrence probability as well as to simulate the trajectories of dangerous rock masses and to realize seismic landslide risk identification on specific infrastructure such as roads. The reliability of this method is then verified by interpretation of the post-earthquake remote sensing and field investigation of landslides induced by the Jiuzaigou Earthquake. The joint modeling and case study described in this article provide an example of and benchmark for earthquake-landslide chain risk identification on specific hazard-bearing objects such as roads and bridges.|$|E

30|$|Risk {{assessment}} always {{tries to}} answer the question: how safe is the element at risk? The risk is usually defined by the product of hazard probability and the undesirable consequence of loss: R[*]=[*]H[*]×[*]V[*]×[*]E in which H (stands for hazard) indicates the probability of the occurrence of a hazard, V represents vulnerability to specific hazard intensity, and E is the exposure of the element at risk. This expression shows that risk level {{is closely related to}} the probability and the intensity of hazard. We therefore developed a <b>joint</b> <b>procedure</b> by coupling the Newmark model and the RockFall Analyst model to identify the risk exposure of the object (road) to seismic landslides. Each model accomplishes specific objectives: the Newmark model is used for seismic landslide probability analysis, and the Rockfall Analyst model is used for further unstable mass movement trajectory simulation.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A hybrid {{operation}} is a <b>joint</b> <b>procedure</b> involving the interventional cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon concomitantly to optimise surgical management. The aim {{of our study}} was to demonstrate the conceptual development and the feasibility of a hybrid approach to complex congenital cardiac surgery. Methods: Descriptive study of two different indications for concomitant intervention by the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon. Seven patients with complex congenital heart defects requiring high risk operative interventions {{were included in the}} study. The indications were: (1) intraoperative stenting of a pulmonary artery stenosis with concomitant additional surgical procedures (n 4). (2) Balloon occlusion of Blalock-Taussig shunts or major aorto-pulmonary collateral artery to control pulmon-ary blood flow during surgical repair (n 3). Results: All patients had successful hybrid procedures. There were no important complications related to the temporal proximity of the interventional procedure and cardiac surgery, the latter being significantly facilitated by the former. Conclusions: Intraoperative stenting of pulmonary artery stenosis with additional surgical repair and balloon occlusion on cardiopulmonary bypass can be performed safely and may be complementary in patients with complex lesions by providing a better result in combination tha...|$|E
40|$|ITER Central Solenoid uses {{butt joints}} for {{connecting}} the pancakes in the CS module. The {{principles of the}} butt joining of the CICC were developed by the JAPT during CSMC project. The difference between the CSMC butt joint and the CS butt joint is that the CS butt joint is an in-line joint, while the CSMC is a double joint through a hairpin jumper. The CS butt joint has to carry the hoop load. The straight length of the joint is only 320 mm, and the vacuum chamber around the joint {{has to have a}} split in the clamp shell. These requirements are challenging. Fig. 1 presents a CSMC joint, and Fig. 2 shows a CS butt joint. The butt <b>joint</b> <b>procedure</b> was verified and demonstrated. The tool is capable of achieving all specified parameters. The vacuum in the end was a little higher than the target, which is not critical and readily correctable.

Unexpectedly, we discover significant temperature nonuniformity in the joint cross section, which is not formally a violation of the specs, but is a point of concern. All testing parameters are recorded for QA purposes.

40|$|Background and purpose: An {{increasing}} number of patients have several <b>joint</b> replacement <b>procedures</b> during their lifetime. We investigated the use and suitability of multi-state model techniques in providing a more comprehensive analysis and description of complex arthroplasty histories held in arthroplasty registries than are allowed for with traditional survival methods. Patients and methods: We obtained data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry on patients (n = 84, 759) who had undergone a total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis in the period 2002 – 2008. We set up a multi-state model where patients were followed from their first recorded arthroplasty to several possible states: revision of first arthroplasty, either a hip or knee as second arthroplasty, revision of the second arthroplasty, and death. The Summary Notation for Arthroplasty Histories (SNAH) was developed {{in order to help}} to manage and analyze this type of data. Results: At {{the end of the study}} period, 12 % of the 84, 759 patients had received a second hip, 3 times as many as had received a knee. The estimated probabilities of having received a second arthroplasty decreased with age. Males had a lower transition rate for receiving a second arthroplasty, but a higher mortality rate. Interpretation: Multi-state models in combination with SNAH codes are well suited to the management and analysis of arthroplasty registry data on patients who experience multiple <b>joint</b> <b>procedures</b> over time. We found differences in the progression of <b>joint</b> replacement <b>procedures</b> after the initial total hip arthroplasty regarding type of joint, age, and sex.
