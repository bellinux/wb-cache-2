In the present study, exergy {{analysis has}} been used to examine the energy consumption of an existing Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) process and then to test for possible savings in primary energy consumption and environmental protection. In the first step, energy and exergy balances of a steam methane reforming process were established to identify the thermodynamic imperfections of the process.

These tools investigate the chemical reactions, design and simulate the entire hydrogen production process, study the energetic and exergetic performances and perform parametric analyses (using intuitive and design of experiment-based methods). Investigating the chemical reaction of steam glycerol reforming reveals that the optimal conditions, determined based on maximizing the hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide contents and coke formation, can be achieved at a reforming temperature and a water-to-glycerol feed ratio (WGFR) of 950 K and 9, respectively.

40|$|This {{research}} work presents the thermodynamic analysis of hydrogen production using {{steam methane reforming}} process at different conditions. The model is developed using HSC 4. 1 software and spreadsheet. Methane is chosen to represent the carbonaceous fuel and steam methane reforming process (once through and cyclic) for hydrogen production is analyzed based on 1 st law and 2 nd law of thermodynamics i. e., energetic and <b>exergetic</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The mass, energy and exergy analysis of each step is done. The optimal condition for production of maximum hydrogen is found using CO 2 removal agent and O 2 transfer compound. The efficiency is calculated {{as a function of}} steam content, temperature and amount of CO 2 removal agent and O 2 transfer compound. The pressure is kept constant at one atmosphere. Operating temperature, CaO loading, Fe 2 O 3 loading and H 2 O content is determined from the once through process. It is found that the maximum H 2 production is with the cyclic process. Maximum H 2 produced in cyclic process with CaO 2 ̆ 6 Fe 2 O 3 loadings is 99. 2...|$|R
