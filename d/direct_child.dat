[...] Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film [...] "so bright and happy and full of light, that [...] wasn't interested." [...] Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made Finding Neverland and did not want to <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> actors again. M.

Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting as he had not read any of the books, or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story. Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling who loved his film Y Tu Mamá También and was impressed with his adaptation of A Little Princess. Heyman found that [...] "tonally and stylistically, [...] was the perfect fit." [...] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, [...] "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process." ...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this qualitative, {{exploratory}} {{study was to investigate}} what <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity may look like in early childhood, what educators think about <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity, including why it is important in early childhood settings, and how early childhood educators can promote <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity among young children. Participants included 22 educators and two researchers who coded video records for <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity. Data sources included 17 video records of preschool instruction that scored high for <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity and semi-structured interviews with the educators. Data were analyzed for possible determinants of <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity, which resulted in a more refined description of the topic, with a better understanding for why it is valuable. From the video record review, <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity was found to have derived from interest and continued with motivation. It required ample time for exploration. Teachers had a role in <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity by providing guidance where they asked questions, connected information, modeled behavior, provided choices, and adjusted control. Teachers were also attentive to the needs and interests of children, which seemed to promote <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity. Interview analysis showed that educators talked about initiative, motivation, control, frequency, age, teacher-to-child ratio, time, environment, materials, choices, play, and trust when describing <b>child</b> <b>directed</b> activity.

50|$|Stepping {{through the}} items of a tree, {{by means of}} the {{connections}} between parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.)A level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root node is visited first, followed by its <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> nodes and their siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until all nodes in the tree have been traversed.|$|E

Convergence between assessment types was explored using correlations. Possible influences of ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) and of parent report language (English or Spanish) were explored using hierarchical linear regression.

40|$|Aggressive and delinquent {{behaviors}} in preadolescents may be indicators of problems suffered at home from <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> abuse {{by one or}} both parents or indirect abuse, such as exposure to domestic violence. A total of 532 Italian preadolescents recruited in their schools took part in this study. They completed a self-report questionnaire measuring <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> abuse from mothers and fathers, exposure to mother-to-father and father-to-mother violence, and externalizing delinquent and aggressive behaviors. Results indicated high levels of delinquent and aggressive behavior, compared to normative data, as well as high levels of reported direct and indirect family abuse. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated an independent significant effect for gender, mother- to-father violence, and both paternal child abuse and maternal child abuse. Discussion includes the importance of addressing externalizing problems of adolescents as indicators of family-related abuse, which may require multiple interventions and coordination between different agencies that work with children. ...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this study to examine the {{opinions}} of mothers concerning services offered in the nursing conference for well child supervision in three areas: <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> care, emotional support, and anticipatory guidance for mothers. A semantic word differential type of questionnaire was used to measure the mothers’ opinions. By assigning numerical values to the selections on the questionnaires, it was possible to use the scores obtained to determine whether the opinions of the services were favorable or unfavorable. Analysis of the data revealed that mothers had an overall favorable opinion of the services. The opinions relating to <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> care showed a more favorable opinion than did those relating to emotional support and anticipatory guidance. The items relating to anticipatory guidance demonstrated the least favorable opinions of the three categories, but was still favorably skewed. Conclusions of this study were that the nursing conferences were well accepted by the majority of the mothers who participated in the study, but that the areas of emotional support and anticipatory guidance were not recognized by some mothers as useful. Recommendations were made that the nurse in the conferences should work toward better interpretation of her counseling and educative functions, and that the nursing conferences be continued...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a unified treatment of externalities associated with fertility and human capital accumulation {{as they relate}} to pension systems. It considers as overlapping generations model in which every generation consists of high earners and low earners with the proportion of types being determined endogenously. The number of children is deterministically chosen but the children’s future ability is in part stochastic, in part determined by the family background, and in part through education. In addition to the customary externality source associated with a change in average fertility rate, this setup highlights another externality source. This is due to the effect of a parent’s choice of number and educational attainment of his children on the proportion of high-ability individuals in the steady state. Our results include: (i) Investments in education of high- and low-ability parents must be subsidized, (ii) <b>direct</b> <b>child</b> subsidies to one or both parent types can be negative; i. e., they can be taxes, (iii) net subsidies to children (<b>direct</b> <b>child</b> subsidies plus education subsidies) to high-ability parents are always positive, and to low-ability parents can be positive or negative, (iv) either education subsidies or child subsidies, when used alone, can dominate the other instrument, (v) using child subsidy instruments alone entails a higher fertility rate and a lower ratio of high- to low-ability children, as compared to using education subsidies alone. pay-as-you-go social security, endogenous fertility, education, endogenous ratio of high to low ability types, three externality sources, education subsidies, child subsidies...|$|E
