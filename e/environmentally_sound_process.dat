High-gravity technology is one important alternative to realizing such solutions. The aims of this work were to expand the knowledge-base on lignocellulosic bioconversion processes at high solids content, to advance the current technologies for production of second-generation liquid biofuels, to evaluate {{the environmental impact of}} the proposed process by using life cycle assessment (LCA), and to develop and present a technically, economically, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>process</b> at high gravity, i. e., a process operating at the highest possible concentrations of raw material. The results and opinions presented here are the result of a Nordic collaborative study {{within the framework of the}} HG Biofuels project. Processes with bioethanol or biobutanol as target products were studied using wheat straw and spruce as interesting Nordic raw materials. During the project, the main scientific, economic, and technical challenges of such a process were identified. Integrated solutions to these challenges were proposed and tested experimentally, using wheat straw and spruce wood at a dry matter content of 30 % (w/w) as model substrates.

40|$|Egypts {{population}} was projected to increase from 20 {{million in the}} 1960 s to 67 million by 2000. With this increase in the population, an increase in food production of 200 % to 300 % is become necessary to meet food demands. In addition to the increasing demand for food, the population increase will result in increased amounts of human wastes. This will, in tum, need to be disposed of in ways other than the traditional dumping in the nearest stream or the Nile River. It is therefore vitally important to utilize {{as much as possible}} of this human waste (biosolids) as an organic fertilizer and soil conditioner to increase sandy soil productivity in Egypt. Composting is recognized as a cost-effective <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>process</b> for treatment of biosolids, even though they may contain substances, which pose potential hazard to the environment or food chain. The aim of this study was therefore set out to develop a management strategy that used biosolids compost as a soil conditioner and fertilizer to increase their agronomic benefits and minimize their environmental impacts when applied to newly reclaimed sandy soil. The agronomic benefits and the environmental impacts of applying biosolids compost to sandy soil were identified through a series of glasshouse, pot, and incubation trials using tomatoes and grass crop. Tomato was chosen as it represents a vegetable with a high potential for heavy metals uptake and because of its world-wide important as vegetable crop. The results of this work showed that, compost application had the capacity to stimulate vigorous growth, nutritional status, production levels of tomato plants, 'and to increase N recovery by tomato plants compared to control. The major nutrient concentrations of N, P, and K in tomato leaves taken from plants grown on compost M. M. Abdel-azeim, Ph. D. Thesis, 2002. The stem radius of tomato plants grown on the compost amended-plots were about twofold thicker {{in the case of the}} highest compost application rate (360 t/ha) than the plants from control plots. At 360 t/ha application rate, the tomatoes production level response for the compost-treated plots was 13. 3 kg/plot while it was 1. 8 kg/plot for the control. This represents an increase of more than 700 % over the control plots. Nitrogen recovered by tomato crop following compost addition exceeded 20 % of the total applied N after one and two compost applications. All these improvements in growth quality parameters of tomato plants were not significantly different at the higher compost application rates of 240 and 360 t/ha. This finding indicates that the plant response due to the increasing of compost application rate is subject to diminishing returns. The incorporation of biosolids compost into sandy soil has established sufficient grass covering area and improved soil aggregate stability compared to mulched-applied compost. The range in grass covering was a low of 7. 9 % for the control to 100 % for incorporated applied compost at all application rates. The grass covering ranged from 7. 9 % for the control to 70 % for mulched applied compost at the highest application rate. Incorporated-applied compost had more large aggregates and less small aggregates and consequently the overall aggregate stability ranged from 25 to 30 % compared to 6 to 11 % in the case of mulched-applied compost. The superiority of the incorporated-applied compost to the mulched-applied compost on aggregate stability was due to the stabilizing effects of the organic matter. The N mineralization rate has suggested that rapid and extensive N accumulated in the soil solution soon (60 days) after compost addition and the amount of N recovered was in excess of 20 % of the total applied N. This value is higher than the 10 % value reported elsewhere in the literature. Soil analysis of the compost treated plots revealed significant increases in soil pH, organic matter, CEC, soluble salts, and total heavy metals compared to control. Major considerations in recycling of biosolids compost on newly reclaimed sandy soils are the increase in soluble salts, the groundwater contamination by nitrate M. M. Abdel-azeim, Ph. D. Thesis, 2002. The increase in soluble salts following compost addition was at a level that could reduce yields in sensitive crops. High application rates of compost at high moisture status resulted in high levels of nitrate in the soil solution (> 50 mg/l). Another concern was the increased amounts of heavy metal accumulation in the soil profile where more than 90 % of the compost- applied heavy metals were present in the top 20 cm of soil plots, but these increased amounts were still far below the plant toxicity levels. The results of this study clearly indicated that incorporated biosolids compost does increased agronomic benefits and does not pose the same environmental problems as mulched biosolids compost when used as a fertilizer with large-scale application rate. Application of biosolids compost significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals in tomato fruit compared to control. Crop recovery of compost-applied Zn and Cu by tomato plants was less than 0. 5 % at all compost application rates regardless of the method of application, and was significantly greater by tomato plants grown on compost-mulched plots than incorporated. Crop recovery of compost-applied Ni, Pb, Cd, and Cr by tomato plants was less than 0. 08 % at all compost application rates. In general, no health problems could be foreseen to humans or animals from food chain movement of these negligible amounts of heavy metals. With regard to heavy metal concentrations in the soil leachate, the data gave wide assurance that the environment is successfully protected. From this study, it could be concluded that high loading rates of good quality compost to sandy soils is ergonomically valuable with limited potential environmental risk if managed properly. Under the conditions of this study, incorporation of biosolids compost into sandy soil using drip irrigation system was the best management strategy practice to reach optimum agronomic benefits while minimizing environmental impacts.

We conclude that the initial focus on the double dividend hypothesis has strongly limited the impact of green taxes.

40|$|The {{production}} of paper pulp involves {{the handling of}} large quantities of fibre suspensions. Today's call for energy efficiency and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>processes</b> {{has led to the}} development of MC (Medium Consistency) technology. Most unit operations in the pulp industry are now routinely performed at concentrations higher than 10 %, at which fibre suspensions behave as solids at low shear rates. If the shear rate is sufficiently high, however, the behaviour of MC suspensions resembles that of pure water. This thesis deals with the network strength (or yield stress) of fibre suspensions, which is a suspension property that may be related to the flow transitions of fibre suspensions. The main cause of network strength is the frictional force in the contact points between single fibres. A novel measurement method was developed to measure the inter-fibre friction of single pulp fibres. The coefficient of friction was found to be around 0. 6 for dry kraft fibres and range between 0. 6 - 0. 8 for wet kraft fibres. A mechanistic model has been developed for predicting the network strength of homogeneous suspensions. It gives fair agreement with experimental yield stress data for homogeneous suspensions; the experimental values for flocculated suspensions were lower. The turbulent flow of pulp fibre suspensions at Medium Consistency has been subject to much speculation due to the absence of direct measurements. A rotary shear-tester, resembling an industrial mixer, was designed and constructed to permit direct velocity measurements using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). The fibre concentrations were up to 20 wt % using a refractive index matched glass fibre suspension. Both mean and fluctuating velocities were found to be close to those of single-phase flow at flows above a critical rotational speed. At lower rotational speeds, the turbulence was strongly suppressed, whereas the mean velocities were close to those of fully developed turbulent flow. The single-phase flow was compared to single-phase CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations using the sliding-grid technique. The flow field was predicted well by using the standard k-epsilon turbulence model, but the absolute values were 25 % too low. Boundary-layer measurements, including the viscous sub-layer, were performed as well. Linear velocity profiles were obtained close to the wall for both the single-phase and the tested suspensions. Further from the wall, flatter velocity profiles were obtained in the fibre suspensions than for single-phase flow...|$|R

Iridium yielded the highest current density at a given overpotential followed by rhodium and platinum regardless of the composition of the electrolyte. Speculation as to metal oxide intermediate phases formed and mechanisms for the oxygen evolution reaction are discussed. Notably, the basicity of the molten aluminosilicate electrolyte was found to greatly influence the rate of oxygen gas evolution as evidenced by the linear dependence of the current density on optical basicity. This is crucial for the design of a full-scale electrolysis cell as improved kinetics of the anodic reaction will yield higher throughput and/or enhanced power efficiency. Combining our finding of the relationship between current density and basicity with previous authors' contributions on the effect of partial pressure of oxygen, we argue that to a first approximation, the magnitude of the current density is governed by the concentration of free oxide ions and by the partial pressure of oxygen in the headspace above the melt.

30|$|Accordingly, {{several in}} situ {{techniques}} have been employed for enhancing HO and EHO recovery {{with the objective}} of upgrading the oil and improving its viscosity and mobility. These techniques include thermal processes, such as in situ combustion and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) (Cavallaro et al. 2008; Moore et al. 1999; Greaves et al. 2001; Kumar et al. 2011; Kapadia et al. 2010; Speight 1970; Jiang et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2004; Maity et al. 2010), and cold techniques, such as treatments using diluents like natural gas condensate (Luo et al. 2007 a, b; James et al. 2008; Castro et al. 2011; Cavallaro et al. 2005). The latter (i.e., cold process) is used to improve the crude oil by dilution or destabilization, and deposition of the asphaltene components in the reservoir by injecting solvents that have a direct impact on viscosity reduction (Luo et al. 2007 b; Cavallaro et al. 2005). The more frequently employed thermal techniques for heavy oil upgrading address breaking the heavier compounds of oil using combustion processes (Moore et al. 1999; Cavallaro et al. 2008), low-temperature oxidation (Xu et al. 2000; Wichert et al. 1995), aquathermolysis (Jiang et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2004; Maity et al. 2010), and pyrolysis, also called thermal cracking or thermolysis (Speight 1970; Kumar et al. 2011; Monin and Audibert 1988; Nassar et al. 2013 a). However, most of these techniques do not exceed 20  %– 25  % oil recovery or 50  % for the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process (Butler 1998; Nasr et al. 2003; Hashemi et al. 2013). Nanoparticle technology has emerged as an alternative with a great potential to improve the previously mentioned techniques and increase oil recovery (Hashemi et al. 2014 a, b, c; Galarraga and Pereira-Almao 2010; Hashemi et al. 2012; Franco et al. 2013 a, b, 2014; Hosseinpour et al. 2014). Because of their small sizes, high surface area/volume ratios, and tunable chemical characteristics, nanoparticles have exceptional adsorptive and catalytic properties and can be employed for in situ adsorption and post-adsorption catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons, such as asphaltenes (Nassar et al. 2011 a, b, c, d, e, 2012 a, b, 2013 b, 2014; Nassar 2010; Franco et al. 2013 c; Hosseinpour et al. 2014; Hashemi et al. 2014 c). It has been demonstrated that with advanced research, nanoparticles can be used to sustain the heavy oil industry via the development of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>processes</b> with cost-effective approaches. For in situ applications, previous studies have provided useful information about the catalytic effects of transition metal oxide and supported nanoparticles on asphaltene gasification (Nassar et al. 2011 a, 2015 a; Franco et al. 2014), pyrolysis (Nassar et al. 2012 b), and oxidation (Franco et al. 2013 b, 2015; Nassar et al. 2011 b, c, d, e, 2012 a, 2013 b, 2014).|$|R
