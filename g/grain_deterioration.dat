40|$|Terminology and definitions, symptoms, causal agents, importance, {{and control}} of fungal-related <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration</b> of sorghum are reviewed. The term grain mold (GM) has gained general {{acceptance}} as the most satisfactory descriptor of this condition. Two concepts of fungal-related <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration</b> {{may be found in}} literature. In one, GM is a condition caused by parasitic and/or saprophytic interactions of numerous fungal spp and the plant at anytime between anthesis and harvest. In the other, only a few fungi infecting and colonizing spikelet tissues prior to grain maturity are involved. Fungi involved in postharvest deterioration (weathering) are not considered part of the GM complex. Numerous forms of GM damage have been described, but little work is reported on quantification of losses. A potential mycotoxin contamination in molded grain samples has been demonstrated. New techniques, including serial dilutions and ergosterol concentration, have been useful in evaluating GM severity. Screening of more than 7000 accessions has identified more than 150 GMresistant line...|$|E

Compared with the susceptible corn hybrid (DF 20 ¥DF 12) under the same conditions, the resistant corn hybrid (FR 35 ¥FR 20) had lower airflow requirements and used less fan energy.

40|$|One {{common and}} {{traditional}} method for detecting stored <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration</b> is to measure grain temperature by contact sensors. Many sensors are installed throughout the bin for this. Temperature maps {{can also be}} obtained using acoustic travel-time tomography, which would be more suitable for store grain due to its non-contact measurement. The measurement of sound travel-time in grain bulk was researched. A time-delay estimation method using triple correlation with wavelet transform is proposed for solving the problem of sound attenuation in grain bulk. A measurement system of sound travel-time based on virtual instrument was built. Sound travel-time in soybeans {{was measured by the}} proposed method, cross-correlation method, and cross-correlation with wavelet transform method. The results show that the proposed method is best in measurement stability and accuracy. Thus it is expected to be used in an actual acoustic temperature monitoring system for stored grain...|$|E

40|$|Grain mold, {{the most}} {{important}} and widespread disease of sorghum worldwide, is a major constraint to sorghum productivity. Production losses due to this disease range from 30 to 100 % depending on cultivars, growing season and prevailing weather conditions during flowering to harvesting (Singh and Bandyopadhyay, 2000). Grain mold can be broadly defined as preharvest <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration</b> caused by several fungal species interacting parasitically and/or saprophytically with developing grain. Fungi belonging to more than 40 genera are associated with molded grains. Among them Fusarium species, Curvularia lunata and Alterneria alternata are major pathogens of worldwide significance. Some species of Fusarium (F andiyagi, F. proliferatum, F. thapsinum, E sacchari and E verticillioides) involved in grain mold complex produce mycotoxins, such as fumonisins, moniliformis trichothecenes, and fusaproliferin (Leslie ei al. 2005). These toxins are harmful to human- and animal-health and also reduce the quality and marketability of grains as food/feed sources (Thakur et al. 2006). The disease is particularly important on improved, short- and medium-duration sorghum cultivars that mature during the rainy season in humid, tropical and sub-tropical climates...|$|E

But some infest grain, {{which can lead}} to catastrophic losses of food supplies, especially in developing countries. Grain is grown and used all over the world, but after grain is harvested, maintaining quality is important not only for human health, but for economic reasons as well. One of the main causes for <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration,</b> especially in warm tropical regions (as well as other developing countries), is insect infestation. In particular, this paper focuses on the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais). It is essential to understand growth dynamics and lifecycle of this pest in order to develop methods for controlling it This experiment focused to develop growth equation {{that can be used to}} predict the population density of the maize weevils. Weevils, yellow dent corn, lab jars, and a growth chamber which provided a controlled environment were used to study population growth of the maize weevil.

40|$|Crispness is {{a salient}} textural {{attribute}} of toasted foods {{strongly related to}} their preference. Crispness is affected by water content, mechanical properties and morphology of the food. Sound emission and force characteristics during food crushing {{play a key role}} in crispness. The aim was to assess the effect of product morphology on sensory crispness grading of toasted rusk roll, a cellular solid food. Products with coarse and fine structures were studied. Additionally, the effect of water on crispness was studied by using samples with water activities from 0. 30 to 0. 8. The sensory test showed that upon absorption of water the product became tough and soft and lost its crispness. The morphology of the product had a significant effect on crispness intensity. Coarse products were rated crispier than those with a fine crumb <b>grain.</b> <b>Deterioration</b> of crispness (Aw 10 %) started at 0. 46 and 0. 50 water activity (6. 2 % and 7. 1 % H 2 O) for the fine and coarse structure product, respectively.

Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chillies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices intended for human or animal consumption. Aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs, milk products, and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains.|$|R
30|$|Integrated {{analysis}} showed that distortion of a crystal lattice and system with higher internal energy appears when Y is diffused into matrix because of its large radius. As a result, solute atoms and the undiffused Y tend to be distributed {{at the front of}} solid–liquid interfaces leading to composition undercooling, so crystallization numbers increase and grain size decreases. With the increase of Y additions, the concentration of solutes also increases which causes the equilibrium crystallization temperature to decrease. In addition, with the undercooling decreased, lots of refined grains are pushed and restricted by each other to progress and grow upwards. At the end of the solidification process, grains tend to be tightly distributed and so mechanical properties such as hardness, strength and toughness are enhanced due to fine grain strengthening. It can be interpreted that refined grains with more boundaries act as obstacles to the propagation of cracks and so as to enhance fracture toughness. In this case, the strength of the matrix and hardness reach a stable status, whereas stress concentration increases and GBs are divided by agglomeration phases that lead to the continuity of boundaries to decrease. The bond strength between grains and tensile strength is reduced which causes the deformation compatibility between <b>grains</b> and <b>deterioration</b> of fracture toughness.|$|R
40|$|The {{fractography}} {{and mechanical}} behaviour of fatigue crack propagation in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of AISI 4140 steel welded using the shielded metal arc process was analysed. Different austenitic grain size {{was obtained by}} normalizing performed at 1200 °C for 5 and 10 hours after welding. Three point bending fatigue tests on pre-cracked specimens along the HAZ revealed that coarse grains promoted an increase in fatigue crack growth rate, hence causing a reduction in both fracture toughness and critical crack length, and a transgranular brittle final fracture with an area fraction of dimple zones connecting cleavage facets. A fractographic analysis proved that as the normalizing time increased the crack length decreased. The increase in the river patterns on the fatigue crack propagation in zone II was also evidenced and final brittle fracture because of transgranular quasicleavage was observed.

Roti quality of 422 genotypes of differentpericarp colors and endosperm texture were evaluated with the help of a trained taste panel. The range of variation for the various quality parameters under study was broad even among cultivars with pearly white grains. Pericarp color, endosperm type, and endosperm texture had significant effects on roti quality. Corneous grains, in genera,, exhibited more density and breaking strength, lower percent water absorption, and better dough and roti quality. Significant effects for season, year, and genotype x year interaction were recorded for grain. dough, and roti qualityparameters. The effect of the nitrogen fertility levelon roti quality was insignificant. However, a considerable effect of soil moisture stress on dough characters was noticed. Wet weather leading to <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration</b> caused the most significant effect on roti quality. The flour particle size index (PSI) varied among cultivars and was associat&d with endosperm texture. Grinding methods were found to have a profound effect on flour properties.

The main importance {{for the growth of}} all the sectors of the agriculture has the growth of grain production as it is the base for both plant growing and animal husbandry and consequently, of the agriculture on the whole. The increase of grain yield is the primary way to raise efficiency of grain production and its inventory. The grain yield is mainly influenced by the introduction of highly productive zoned grain sorts, by the use of a highly qualified seeds, fertilizer application. Currently in the Rostov region the decrease of the yield and <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration</b> are observed. It is closely related with carrying-out of nutritive materials which are not reimbursed by the facilities of humus renewal, deficient attention on technologies of preparation and application of organic fertilizer. The crop yields in the Rostov region are formed mainly {{at the expense of the}} natural soil fertility and nutrient stores created in previous years. A high level of wearing out of fixed assets is caused directly by insufficient investment of agriculture. It is required to apply modern technologies including watering system, concentration and fertilization for support of soil quality for the compensation of destructive effect. Thus, at present, the qualitative development of agriculture is objectively associated with the development of capital-intensive areas in the grain industry. Special attention in the paper is devoted to the agricultural sector of Ukraine, which is currently in crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|Silos are {{the most}} {{appropriate}} structures for the bulk storage of grains. Their performances are greatly influenced by the materials of construction and the climatic environment where they are used. Under the warm and humid climate prevalent in Nigeria, metal silos which are the predominant structures used for grain storage experience moisture condensation, resulting in <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration.</b> There is therefore the need to source for construction materials that will eliminate moisture condensation, durable, easy to construct, cheap and readily available to farmers. Termite mound clay {{was identified as a}} potential material. A 5. 6 m 3 silo was designed and the prototype constructed with treated termite mound clay bricks. Temperatures were measured inside and outside the silo and the quality of grain stored in the silo was monitored over a period of two months. Viability tests of stored grain were also undertaken. Minimum and maximum temperatures outside the silo were 21 oC and 36 oC as against 20 oC and 30 oC inside the silo. Temperature fluctuation within the silo was 9. 5 oC compared with 10. 3 oC outside. Grain quality was maintained during the storage period, the viability before and after storage were 88 % and 84 % respectively. The treated termite mound clay silo demonstrated great potential for reducing temperature fluctuations and maintaining grain quality in storage.

30|$|With the {{emergence}} of simple post-harvest technologies, storage losses in cowpea can now be controlled {{without the use of}} pesticides. Many storage facilities have emerged, but sometimes are too expensive for many smallholder farmers in the tropics and sub-tropics to afford. Also, most of these farmers are not able to purchase pesticides to control pests and diseases during storage. Although the use of chemicals still remains a principal approach to solving post-harvest losses among many smallholder farmers, misuse of insecticides is common and causes health and environmental problems [1, 7]. The use of metal silos for storing grains, for instance, is only limited to the temperate regions. When used in hot, humid climates and semi-tropical regions, they produced negative results by causing humidity damage to the stored commodities [8]. It was further explained that during storage, grains experiencing too high temperature, adequate oxygen, and high relative humidity lead to the formation of molds which deteriorate grain quality. For most smallholder farmers in Africa, hermetic storage could be a practical approach because it is chemical-free and offers a cost-effective way of controlling insects during storage, thereby maintaining the quality of the grain [9 – 11]. Hermetic storage principally occurs in a controlled environment which continuously depletes oxygen and simultaneously increases carbon dioxide {{as a result of the}} respiratory activities of insects in the ecological system of a sealed storage [12]. According to [10], grain losses may vary depending on the geographical location, the year, the atmospheric condition, the available post-harvest technologies, and finally the amount of grain harvested. Due to the many factors influencing the rate of <b>grain</b> <b>deterioration,</b> it is exceedingly difficult to quantify the losses in stored grain [13]. This work therefore took a major step to evaluate the effect of hermetic and non-hermetic storage on moisture content, insect infestation, grain mass, and usable proportion of grains obtained from a local farmer in Ghana.|$|E

(3) Develop the optimum daily filling strategy and design recommendations for a low-temperature corn drying system for Central Iowa;The following conclusions are given for Central Iowa conditions. It is expected the findings would be similar for most of the Corn Belt. (1) CORNSIM is a valid simulation model of a corn production enterprise. It can be used to determine the relative effects of changes in production strategy. (2) FALDRY is a valid simulation model of a low-temperature corn drying system.

40|$|Sprouting damage nay {{occur when}} wet weather initiates {{germination}} processes in unharvested <b>grain,</b> with subsequent <b>deterioration</b> in breadmaking quality. It {{is a potential}} hazard to wheat growing regions throughout the world, e. g. Europe (Olered, 1967; Belderok, 1968), Australia (Moss, et al., 1972) and New Zealand (Sanders, 1974; McEwan, 1976 a). Seed dormancy is usually accepted as being related {{in some way to}} resistance to sprouting damage (e. g. Belderok, 1968 a); that is, dormancy may be associated with lack of catabolic processes in the endosperm (Ching, 1972; Leshem, 1973; Villiers, 1972). Several enzymes initiated during the germination process are involved in the degradation of the starch and protein of the endosperm. These enzymes include alpha-amylase, which break the branch chain amylopectin starch molecules to dextrins and amylases, and beta-amylase which degrade these smaller compounds to low molecular weight dextrins and maltose (Kent-Jones and Amos, 1967; Pyler, 1969). Beta-amylase is present in the sound grain but its activity is restricted, as there are relatively few exo-groups at which this enzyme is capable of hydrolysing (Kent-Jones and Amos, 1967; Pyler, 1969). Alpha-amylase appears a major factor in starch dextrinisation, and levels of this enzyme relate to the degree of sprout damage (Johansson, 1976; Olered, 1967; Moss et al., 1972). Other enzymes may also be involved in early germination, such as proteolytic enzymes (Gordon, 1975; Kruger, 1976). In sprout damaged wheat, the increased level of starch dextrinisation results in an inferior loaf (Olered, 1967; Pyler, 1967; Moss et al., 1972). The loaf is reduced in volume, has a grey and sticky crumb, and a dark crust colour (Olered, 1967; Kent-Jones and Amos, 1968; Pyler, 1969; McDermott, 1971). Sprout damaged grain may also have a lighter bushel or test weight (Ghaderi and Everson, 1971; Fouler and de la Roche, 1975), and lowered milling yield (Belderok, 1968; McEwan, 1959).

30|$|Rare earth (RE) {{elements}} {{have positive}} effects on Al alloy, while most research is focused on microstructure and mechanical properties. As important application indices, toughness and plasticity are properties that are sensitive to alloy fracture characteristics, and few research studies have characterized the fracture properties of Al–Cu–Mn alloy on RE elements. The effect of different contents of Y on the fracture properties of Al–Cu–Mn alloy is investigated. T 6 heat treatment (solid solution and artificial aging treatment), optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) methods are applied to the alloy. Results showed that when Y element is present at 0.1 %, {{the section of the}} as-cast alloy has smaller sized dimples and the fracture mode presents ductile features. Slight changes in hardness are also observed and maintained at about 60 HV. With increasing content of the RE element Y from 0.1 to 0.5 %, the θ phase and Cu atoms in the matrix were reduced and most stopped at Grain boundaries (GBs). Micro-segregation and an enriched zone of Y near the GBs gradually increased. At the same time, the inter-metallic compound AlCuY is aggregated at <b>grain</b> junctions causing <b>deterioration</b> of the micro-structure and fracture properties of the alloy. After T 6 treatment, the flatness of the fracture surface was lower than that of all the as-cast alloy showing lots of dimples and teared edges with a significant increase in hardness. When Y content was 0.1 %, the strength and hardness of the alloy increased due to refinement of the grain strengthening effect. The content of Y elements segregated in the inter-dendritic zone and GBs is reduced. Plasticity and deformation compatibility also improved, making cracks difficult to form and merge with each other along adjacent grain junctions and providing an increased potential for ductile fracture. This paper proposes the addition of RE Y as an effective and prospective strategy to improve the fracture properties of the Al–Cu–Mn alloy and provide a meaningful reference in terms of improving overall performance.|$|R

To meet this need, ICRISAT hosted an International Symposium on Sorghum Grain Quality in October 1981 at ICRISAT Center near Hyderabad, India. It was sponsored by the USAID Title XII Collaborative Research Support Program on Sorghum and Pearl Millet (INTSORMIL), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR),and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). Participants interested in sorghum as a food who attended the Symposium represented diverse disciplines: food technology, home economics, nutrition, breeding, biochemistry, food processing, engineering, pathology, and economics, and the topics included the existing knowledge on preparing sorghum as a food, its <b>grain</b> structure and <b>deterioration,</b> milling and laboratory methods for evaluating and improving food quality, nutrition, consumer acceptance, marketing, and quality standards. A wide range of sorghum grain types is used to prepare different solid and liquid foods such as porridges, leavened and unleavened breads, snacks, beverages, and beer. However, there are two major disadvantages of sorghum as a food—the problems of nutrient uptake, and the constant drudgery involved in hand pounding and hand grinding to make sorghum flour. Sorghum grain quality is a complex subject. Only in recent years have nutritionists and millers studied the problems associated wi t h sorghum. To replace hand processing, several pilot projects using machines for pearling and grinding are under way in some locations in Africa. Increasingly, plant breeders are developing new varieties and hybrids. For successful adoption of new cultivars by farmers, consumer acceptance is an essential requirement.

40|$|The ongoing “Digital Revolution” places ever {{increasing}} demands on mobile devices. It does not only {{account for a}} constant generation of new products, but also requires a continuous optimisation of the individual components of such devices. As a result, the technology sector of smartphones, tablets, wearables etc. is rapidly growing. Inthe current work, specific materials from the classes of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and phase-change materials (PCMs) were investigated {{with respect to their}} elemental distribution. These material classes are promising {{to meet the challenges of}} display and data storage applications, respectively. (i) The material most commonly used in display applications, namely In 2 O 3 :Sn, called tin-doped indium oxide or indium tin oxide (ITO), contains indium, which is scarce and thus expensive. Hence, intensive research is focused on finding an alternative material. One of the most promising candidates for substituting ITO is ZnO:Al. This material combines natural abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, and thermal stability. Although its resistivity in the as-deposited state cannot keep up with that of ITO, it can be decreased by post-deposition heat treatment. Prior to this work, it had been found that the same annealing parameters might lead to an enhancement of the electricalproperties if a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) capping layer is used during heat treatment, while upon annealing without any capping layer the charge carrier mobility as well as the charge carrier density might be decreased. In the frame of the current work, the degradation of the electronic properties upon specific heat treatment without any capping layer could be correlated with aluminium segregation at the grain boundaries by employing atom probe tomography (APT). Further investigation of additional samples confirmed the correlation of segregation of the dopant at the <b>grain</b> boundaries with <b>deterioration</b> of the electronic properties. In addition to ZnO:Al, the non-classical TCO material TiO 2 :Nb was investigated by means of APT. The fact that for this materialthe evaporation field of the dopant is higher than that of the matrix metal makes APT investigations difficult. However, the yield could be improved by selecting the lowest possible base temperature. (ii) The increasing amounts of data stored on mobile devices require a technology that offers high storage densities. PCMs feature excellent scaling properties and fast switching between the logical states, which arerealised by the amorphous and the crystalline phase. If their endurance can be sufficiently increased, they might replace the Flash memory and maybe even the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which would turn them into a “universal memory”. While PCMs have already been successfully used in optical data storage devices for more than 20 years, in case of electronic data storage applications, atomic migration of the elements towardsdifferent electrodes had been observed for Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5. Furthermore, crystallisation of the PCM GeTe in a furnace had been found to lead to germanium precipitation in case of annealing temperatures of T = 250 °C and above. The question arises whether precipitation can be suppressed upon fast switching. No APT measurements on PCMs had been reported in literature so far. For this reason, it was one of the aims of the current work to establish APT on GeTe, which is a parent compound of prominent ternary PCMs. The knowledge gained from these experiments can be used in future investigations of phase-change memory cells. In this context,first the evaporation field of GeTe was determined to be roughly F_GeTe ~ 16 V/nm. Secondly, germanium precipitates were not only found in a sample annealed at T = 290 °C, but also in a sample annealed at T = 220 °C. Since earlier results had been gained employing x-ray diffraction (XRD), which cannot detect amorphous phases,this new result can be explained by the precipitation of amorphous germanium at a temperature of T = 220 °C or below and the crystallisation of these precipitates at T = 250 °C. In summary, in the present work the importance of the atomic arrangement of the different elements on the physical properties of various electronic materials could be highlighted and concretised with regard to their application in mobile devices. For this purpose, atom probe measurements on novel materials were established. The obtained results might lay the foundation for a trendsetting and targeted development of new technologies...|$|R
