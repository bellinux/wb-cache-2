40|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>activities</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems facing the Indonesian forest sector today. The debate on <b>illegal</b> forest <b>activities</b> has focused primarily on legal and governance issues. Economic forces, however, are increasingly recognized as fundamental drivers of <b>illegal</b> forest <b>activities.</b> We ask the question whether the legalization of small logging concessions and their development can teach us anything about how to address the illegal logging problem. We find that legalization alone-when a legal timber concession is granted to a previously illegal operator-does not necessarily result in a significant reduction in <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b> When <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> are profitable, they can be expected to continue. Changing the regulatory framework to increase monitoring and enforcement can affect the profitability of these <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b> By changing the underlying economic incentives for logging, such interventions hold greater promise of success. In the medium to long term, however, legalization may help reduce illegal logging when it entrusts local people with ownership and control of forest resources and maintains a monitoring role for government agencies...|$|R

5|$|John Meares, who {{had also}} served under Cook, sailed to the North West Coast in 1786. He spent the winter in Prince William Sound, his ship trapped by ice and his men dying of scurvy.

Meares was captain of the Felice and William Douglas was captain of the Iphigenia. Meares decided not to license his ships with the EIC, instead trying to conceal the <b>illegal</b> <b>activity</b> by using the flag of Portugal. They arrived at Nootka Sound in May 1788. Meares later claimed that Chief Maquinna sold him some land and on it Meares had a building erected. These claims later became a point of dispute during the Nootka Crisis. Spain, which sought control of Nootka Sound, rejected both claims; the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. There is no doubt, however, that Meares had the sloop North West America built in Nootka Sound, the first nonindigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million.

The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this <b>illegal</b> <b>activity</b> by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E

5|$|While Yellowstone {{was under}} army management, the activities, {{policies}} and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved {{a wide variety of}} problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of <b>illegal</b> <b>activity.</b> That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the campaign hat, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry {{in the last years of}} army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21stcentury.|$|E

40|$|Within {{protected}} areas, biodiversity loss {{is often}} a consequence of illegal resource use. Understanding the patterns and extent of <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> is therefore essential for effective law enforcement and prevention of biodiversity declines. We used extensive data, commonly collected by ranger patrols in many protected areas, and Bayesian hierarchical models to identify drivers, trends, and distribution of multiple <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> within the Queen Elizabeth Conservation Area (QECA), Uganda. Encroachment (e. g., by pastoralists with cattle) and poaching of noncommercial animals (e. g., snaring bushmeat) were the most prevalent <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> within the QECA. <b>Illegal</b> <b>activities</b> occurred in {{different areas of the}} QECA. Poaching of noncommercial animals was most widely distributed within the national park. Overall, ecological covariates, although significant, were not useful predictors for occurrence of <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b> Instead, the location of <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> in previous years was more important. There were significant increases in encroachment and noncommercial plant harvesting (nontimber products) during the study period (1999 - 2012). We also found significant spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of all activities. Our results show the need to explicitly model ranger patrol effort to reduce biases from existing uncorrected or capture per unit effort analyses. Prioritization of ranger patrol strategies is needed to target illegal activities; these strategies are determined by protected area managers, and therefore changes at a site-level can be implemented quickly. These strategies should also be informed by the location of past occurrences of illegal activity: the most useful predictor of future events. However, because spatial and temporal changes in <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> occurred, regular patrols throughout the protected area, even in areas of low occurrence, are also required...|$|R

5|$|As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a {{probable}} hub of illicit trade, and Francesco {{was forced to}} leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani's death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related to <b>illegal</b> <b>activity.</b> Francesco's name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted in absentia, the fugitive remained in touch with his family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town in the municipality of San Germán, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don ("of noble origin"). Francesco's name was Hispanicized to Francisco Cofresí, which was easier for his neighbors to pronounce. Since he was linked to illegal commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met María Germana Ramírez de Arellano, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ramírez de Arellano y del Toro, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano. Her family, descended from the aristocracy of Navarre, owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco's father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani's murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city.|$|E
