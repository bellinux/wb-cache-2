25|$|In {{recent years}} {{attempts}} have been made to run shuttles between the Port of Melbourne and inland ports. Between 2003 and 2006 CRT Group operated a shuttle to their terminal at Altona, 22 kilometers from the docks. In 2004/05, the service transported 13,000 TEU, this being 42 per cent capacity for import and 58 per cent for export containers. The service ceased due to high access fees charged by track operator ARTC, and delays by interstate freight trains sharing the same track making the reliable operation of two trips per day impossible. The service restarted in 2005, but failed for the same reasons. A second port shuttle has operated to the Austrack terminal at Somerton during various periods since 1998, with difficulties faced including inefficient track layouts, high rail transfer charges at the port, and inconvenient timetables dictated by long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> services.|$|E
25|$|From the 1920s, London was {{surrounded}} by a number of large freight Marshalling yards, where long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> was brought and re-organised into new trains for onward transmission to its destination. Three of these yards, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green were operated by the Southern Railway. The requirement for a fast freight transfer locomotive between these yards, and across London to other railway yards provided a challenge for Richard Maunsell. The electrified suburban lines were busy with commuter traffic that took priority over freight workings, and the London network abounded in junctions and signal stops. The design brief called for a powerful locomotive with good acceleration and adhesion. One that was able to climb the steep gradients over the flying junctions that were to be found all over the Southern Railway's London network. The ability to operate over tight curves and be able to move from a standstill on the aforementioned gradients were also key considerations that needed to be incorporated into the design. A tank locomotive design was also preferable since the journeys were relatively short, and the work would involve frequent changes in direction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the line, freight was {{primarily}} local and the railway served as a link between ports and their hinterland. [...] Long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> progressively developed over the course of the 20th century, aided by the decline of coastal shipping and the need to carry freight to ports in other regions.|$|E
25|$|Barcelona is a {{major hub}} for RENFE, the Spanish state railway network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França {{terminus}} serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium <b>distance</b> services. <b>Freight</b> services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.|$|R
50|$|Since 2005 Tenaris, the world’s largest {{producer}} of seamless steel pipe, has donated the pipes for the bridges Toni builds {{across the world}} - scrap and surplus pipes, sometimes even new - from their mills in Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Indonesia, including the long <b>distance</b> ocean <b>freight</b> to final destination.|$|R
50|$|Between Frankfurt West and Friedberg the two {{tracks of}} the Main-Weser Railway {{is shared by}} S-Bahn, regional, long <b>distance</b> and <b>freight</b> traffic. To improve operations, {{this section of the}} line is being {{upgraded}} from two to four tracks by about 2016. Planning permission for this project has already been granted in the Bad Vilbel area.|$|R
2500|$|After {{storage for}} some years at Manchester Airport, four ex-BSAAC Tudor IVs were bought by Air Charter in late 1953. They were fitted with [...] by [...] cargo doors aft by Aviation Traders and {{designated}} Super Traders IV or IVB, receiving their Certificate of Airworthiness in March 1955. These were operated by Air Charter Ltd on long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> flights as far as Christmas Island. Some remained in service until 1959, until G-AGRH [...] "Zephyr" [...] crashed in Turkey on 23 April 1959.|$|E
2500|$|Since 0-6-0 tender engines {{can pull}} fairly heavy trains, albeit slowly, the type was {{commonly}} used to pull short and medium <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> trains such as pickup goods trains along both main and branch lines. The tank engine versions were widely used as switching (shunting) locomotives since the smaller 0-4-0 types were not {{large enough to be}} versatile in this job. [...] and larger switching locomotives, on the other hand, were too big to be economical or even usable on lightly built railways such as dockyards and goods yards, precisely the sorts of places where switching locomotives were most needed.|$|E

2500|$|The SR Class W were 3-cylinder 2-6-4T tank engines {{designed}} in 1929 by Richard Maunsell {{for use on}} the Southern Railway [...] They were introduced in 1932 and constructed at Eastleigh and Ashford. The class was intended for short <b>distance,</b> inter-company/regional <b>freight</b> traffic transfer in London, and were standardised with parts from the N, N1, U and U1 classes.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, 2-8-4 tender {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} mainly for passenger express trains, {{but they also}} hauled long <b>distance</b> express <b>freights</b> to increase utilisation. European 2-8-4 tank locomotives were a logical transition from the 2-8-2T locomotive types, allowing larger fireboxes and larger coal bunkers. They were mainly used for busy suburban services in heavily populated suburban areas of big cities, but infrequently also for sparsely populated rural areas or long distance lines.|$|R
50|$|Long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> {{used the}} line into the 1960s, notably the Grimsby to Whitland express fish train.|$|E

50|$|In April 1962 the {{standard}} gauge line was extended south from Wodonga to Melbourne {{and from that}} time onwards, most interstate haulage was on {{the standard}} gauge. Some broad gauge passenger trains still continued to run to Albury to provide a local service to north eastern Victorian towns but the long <b>distance</b> interstate <b>freight</b> and passenger trains operated via this new continuous standard gauge link between Melbourne and Sydney.|$|R
25|$|The Mumbai Suburban Railway {{system is}} {{operated}} by Indian Railways' two zonal divisions Western Railways (WR) and Central Railways (CR). The fast commuter rail corridors on Central Railway {{as well as}} Western Railway are shared with long <b>distance</b> and <b>freight</b> trains, while inner suburban services operate on exclusive parallel tracks. WR operates the Western Line and CR operates the Central Line, Harbour Line, Trans-Harbour Line {{as well as the}} Vasai Road-Diva-Panvel line.|$|R
50|$|The Roca Railway is {{currently}} operated by State owned companies Trenes Argentinos (that operates commuter rail services in Buenos Aires) and Ferrobaires (for long <b>distance</b> services) while <b>freight</b> transport {{is run by}} private companies Ferrosur Roca and Ferroexpreso Pampeano.|$|R
50|$|Cargo was {{transported by}} air in {{specialized}} cargo aircraft {{and in the}} luggage compartments of passenger aircraft. Air freight is typically the fastest mode for long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> transport, but also the most expensive.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} H class, the H1s were built with the NSR's long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> work {{outside of their}} own system thanks to their {{extensive}} running powers, but they also partook in some passenger and excursion trains.|$|E

30|$|In the {{proposed}} transport system, freight is firstly {{delivered to the}} UDC through trucks or trains which perform the long <b>distance</b> transport. After, <b>freight</b> is reorganized and consolidated into load units, i.e. the FURBOT boxes, according to packages dimension and to the addresses of receivers.|$|R
50|$|Qatar Rail Long Distance: Qatar Rail’s Long <b>Distance</b> Passenger and <b>Freight</b> Rail project envisages {{development}} of a long <b>distance</b> passenger and <b>freight</b> rail network to connect major population centres and Qatari industries and to form part of the planned Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) railway network linking the six countries of the region (the State of Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, State of Kuwait, Kingdom of Bahrain, and Sultanate of Oman). The network will be executed over four phases. There will be five main lines: 1 freight line, 3 mixed passenger and freight lines and 1 high-speed passenger line. Phase 1 includes construction of nearly 143km of railway track with a station, three freight yards, an intermodal yard, 59 bridges and 36 culverts.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{interurban}} trunk {{roads are}} [...] "primary routes", {{the category of}} roads recommended for long <b>distance</b> and <b>freight</b> transport. Not all primary routes are trunk roads, the difference being that maintenance of trunk roads is paid for by national government bodies rather than the local councils in whose area they lie. Primary routes are identified by their direction signs, which feature white text on a green background with route numbers in yellow. Trunk roads, like other [...] "A" [...] roads, can be either single- or dual-carriageway.|$|R
50|$|The E2 class {{locomotives}} {{were mainly}} {{used for the}} heavier shunting and short <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> duties in the London area and on the south coast, as their small coal bunkers made them unsuitable for long trips. These included empty stock workings at Victoria and London Bridge Stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} {{was acquired by}} Veolia Cargo in 2008, which was acquired by SNCF in 2009.

50|$|The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) E2 Class was a {{class of}} 0-6-0T steam {{locomotives}} designed by Lawson Billinton, intended for shunting and short <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> trains. Ten examples were built between 1913 and 1916, and were withdrawn from service and scrapped between 1961 and 1963.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the S-Bahn, {{the network}} of {{regional}} trains does not have its own segregated tracks, but rather shares tracks with longer <b>distance</b> passenger and <b>freight</b> services. Within Berlin, regional services stop less frequently than S-Bahn services, especially where they run parallel to U-Bahn or S-Bahn lines.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{regards the}} {{influence}} of control system and automation level on the circulation capacity. Operation model is also investigated: lines dedicated for commuter services versus lines with a mixed traffic (commmuter, long <b>distance</b> and <b>freight),</b> lines with both local and express services and lines with only local services. Three cases are described: the central corridor of the S-bhan in Munchen, the "Passante" of Milan and the urban section of the "Cintura" of Rome. Finally the common basic features of a signalisation system for an high frequency services are highlighted...|$|R
50|$|Since the 19th century, Lambertville, {{due to its}} {{proximity}} to the canal and the Belvidere Delaware Railroad, became a factory town where the range of products produced extended from underwear to rubber bands. After the introduction of motorized vehicles made the canal obsolete, the factories began shutting down. Some {{made it into the}} 1970s. The railroad continued to serve as a vital freight carrier until the mid 1970s. Later, the Black River and Western Railroad acquired the line into town and continued operating short <b>distance</b> local <b>freight</b> trains as well as scenic tourist passenger excursion trains into the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|They are {{primarily}} used on long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> trains in Australia, where train crew sign on at one depot, and alternate crewing the train during the journey.

50|$|The {{track is}} {{important}} for long <b>distance</b> <b>freight</b> transport as it bypasses the Frankfurt am Main rail node. It connects the Left and Right Rhine line with the Main-Spessart Railway and also to the north to Hanau and the Frankfurt-Bebra railway, the Friedberg-Hanau line and the Main-Weser Railway. The line is also used by Motorail trains and occasionally used for military and nuclear waste transport.|$|E
