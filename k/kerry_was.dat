5|$|Born in Temora, New South Wales, {{near the}} {{regional}} centre of Wagga Wagga, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> {{one of two}} sons born to a car salesman. Kerry's mother was a swimming teacher who ran her own aquatic school. <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> taught to swim by his mother, whom he regarded as a perfectionist who emphasised technique and turned him to backstroke. Kerry grew up participating {{in a wide range}} of sports, representing Wollongong High School in tennis, athletics and swimming. He also competed four times in the state cross-country championships. Once his family had moved to the seaside city of Wollongong, Kerry developed a love of the surf. He found the ocean water much more exciting due to its unpredictability. Kerry steadily rose through the surf lifesaving ranks, competing at the state and national championships. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first competitive race at the age of 12 in 1971. At the time, Brad Cooperwho went on to win the 400m freestyle at the 1972 Summer Olympicswas living in Wollongong and he and Kerry trained together on a regular basis. In 1974, Kerry competed in the Australian Age Championships in freestyle, before moving north to train with John Rigby in Brisbane, Queensland in the following year. At the time of his move, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> ranked around 200th in the world in backstroke.|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, Kerry {{arrived at}} Indiana University, {{studying}} theatre, drama and telecommunications. Based on {{the times that}} he recorded for Indiana, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> named in the Australian squad for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada. However, his international career {{appeared to be in}} disarray when along with two teammates, Tonelli and Joe Dixon, he was expelled from the Australian team for breaking a curfew on American Independence Day during a training camp in Honolulu, Hawaii. According to Tonelli, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> late because he was courting a female he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking. Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked marijuananot illegal under Hawaii lawon the night. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions, saying that it was not illegal. Supporters in Australia, including future Prime Minister Bob Hawke, launched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio, which garnered thousands of signatures, but to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than two}} months after the election, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Senator John Kerry to become United States Secretary of State. <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> sworn in on February 1, making newly inaugurated Warren the state's senior Senator, and the Senate's most-junior senior senator. In the Senate special election to replace Kerry the following year, Democratic nominee Ed Markey asked his Republican rival Gabriel E. Gomez to sign a similar pledge with him, although Gomez refused.|$|E

50|$|In 1999 <b>Kerry</b> <b>were</b> {{attempting}} {{to secure a}} fourth provincial title in succession. Cork {{put an end to}} this dream with a 2-10 to 2-4 win over their great rivals in the Munster final. With that <b>Kerry</b> <b>were</b> dumped out of the championship.|$|R
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> confident {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed {{longtime friend of}} Kennedy and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> {{second in}} his {{heat of the}} 200m {{freestyle}} heat {{in a time of}} 1m 54.86s, but was four seconds off the pace and did not qualify for the final. His time was 2.08s behind the slowest qualifier, placing him 16th. Kerry did not get to swim in the 4200m freestyle relay. The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth.|$|E
50|$|In football, <b>Kerry</b> <b>are</b> {{undoubtedly}} Cork's biggest rivals as {{they meet}} year in year {{out in the}} Munster Senior Football Championship and recently in the All-Ireland series of games as well. <b>Kerry</b> <b>are</b> traditionally dominant, having won the Munster Championship over 75 times, while Cork have less than 40 titles. <b>Kerry</b> <b>are</b> similarly dominant in terms of All-Irelands won, topping the list with 36 titles as of their 2009 win while Cork have had seven titles since their 2010 triumph.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kerry</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} {{successful}} county in the competition's history, having lifted the title on eighteen occasions. <b>Kerry</b> <b>are</b> current winners winning {{three in a row}} All Irelands. The 2008 championship was won by Dublin {{for the first time since}} 1960. Sligo defeated Kerry in 2010 to win their first title since 1935.|$|R
2500|$|County <b>Kerry</b> (...) <b>is</b> {{a county}} in Ireland. <b>Kerry</b> <b>is</b> {{located in the}} South-West Region and {{is also part of}} the {{province}} of Munster. It is named after the Ciarraige who lived in part of the present county. <b>Kerry</b> County Council <b>is</b> the local authority for the county and Tralee serves as the county town. The population of the county was 147,554 in 2016, according to the 2016 census.|$|R
5|$|Throughout his life, Crean {{remained}} an extremely modest man. When {{he returned to}} Kerry, he put all of his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press. It has been speculated that {{this may have been}} because <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an epicentre of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black and Tan raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Australia in 1984 and after training in Brisbane, {{he was selected}} for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles despite winning neither backstroke event at the Australian Championships. Arriving in the United States, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> scheduled {{to compete in the}} 100m backstroke and 4100m medley relay. Kerry swam quickly to win his heat in the 100m in a time of 57.15s, qualifying third fastest for the final. However, he was unable to improve his pace in the final, finishing fifth in a time of 57.18s, 0.69s from the bronze medal. In the medley relay, Kerry and Evans joined Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell, who swam the butterfly and freestyle respectively. They were no match for the Americans, who had three of the four gold medallists in the corresponding individual events and finished almost four seconds ahead. Kerry had Australia in third place at the first change, finishing his leg in a time of 57.12s, but by this point the Americans were already 1.71s ahead. Australia remained third at every change and were beaten by the second-placed Canadians by just 0.02s.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{trained by}} his mother, Kerry enjoyed success in {{swimming}} and surf lifesaving as a teenager. His swimming career progressed to senior Australian standards after {{he switched to}} the tutelage of John Rigby and moved to Queensland. He made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships and promptly won the 200m freestyle and backstroke events to win selection for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{at the age of}} 16. At the Olympics, Kerry reached the final in two events, coming seventh and fifth in the 100m and 200m backstroke respectively. <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> disappointed with his performances, but they attracted the attention of American coach Doc Counsilman, who invited Kerry to swim under him at the Indiana University. Kerry set Australian records while in the United States, but his international career hit trouble when he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaking a curfew.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> {{disappointed}} with his performances, {{feeling that he}} had failed to perform to his potential amid the pressure and excitement of an Olympics. However, he felt that his experience of racing against the likes of Naber and Roland Matthes would hold him in good stead. On a brighter note, Kerry's performances impressed the leading American coach Doc Counsilman, who invited him to come and swim at Indiana University after Kerry finished his secondary schooling in Australia. Kerry successfully defended his 200m backstroke national title in 1977, but the time was more than four seconds slower than his effort in the previous year. He combined with his New South Wales teammates to win all three relays, again in times substantially slower than in the preceding Olympic year. The performances earned him selection for the Australian team for the Coca-Cola Meet in London, but Kerry felt that he lacked motivation after the Olympics. Upon returning, he decided to absent himself from such events.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{had always}} won the 4100m medley relay since the event's {{inception}} at the Olympics in 1960 with comfortable margins. The closest winning buffer was 2.6seconds and in 1972 and 1976 they had won by 4.10 and 3.72s respectively; their boycott {{opened up the}} field in the event. In the five previous times the event had been contested, Australia's best result had come in the inaugural race in Rome, where the team of David Theile, Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton out-touched Japan to claim silver. The only other time that Australia had won a medal was in Tokyo in 1964, when Peter Reynolds, Ian O'Brien, Kevin Berry and David Dickson finished behind the United States and Germany. The following two Games saw a fourth placing and an elimination in the heats. The previous outing in 1976 in Montreal had seen Australia come sixth. <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> the only veteran of the 1976 relay team who returned to the Olympics in Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} US for the Olympics, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> {{threatened}} with {{the cancellation of}} his US visa. Kerry arrived in Moscow facing a four event schedule: he was nominated in both backstroke events and the 4200m freestyle relay and the 4100m medley relay. With the Americans and many other western swimmers absent, Australian officials were confident that their three entrants in the 100m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and Glenn Patching, would all make the final and win medals. Kerry came third in both his heat and semi-final, clocking 58.08s and 58.07s respectively, missing out on the final by just 0.02s. He was the ninth fastest in the closely run semifinals, with the third fastest qualifier being only 0.18s faster. Patching missed the final after slipping on the starting wall in his race, while Tonelli went on to finish seventh. Had Kerry matched his personal best of 65.50s, he would have {{won the gold medal}} ahead of Sweden's Bengt Baron.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, <b>Kerry</b> <b>were</b> {{attempting}} {{to secure a}} fourth provincial title in succession, while Ó Sé was hopeful of winning his first {{on the field of}} play.

25|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries Kerry became {{increasingly}} populated by poor tenant farmers, {{who came to}} rely on the potato as their main food source. As a result, when the potato crop failed in 1845, <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> very hard hit by the Great Irish Famine of 1845–49. In the wake of the famine, many thousands of poor farmers emigrated to seek a better life in America and elsewhere. <b>Kerry</b> <b>was</b> to remain a source of emigration until recent times. Another long term consequence of the famine was the Land War of the 1870s and 1880s, in which tenant farmers agitated, sometimes violently for better terms from their landlords.|$|E
