60|$|At {{last the}} {{explosive}} power, {{which was not}} yet exhausted, evidently reached the main store of dynamite which had been lowered into the worm hole. The result was appalling. The ground for far around quivered and opened in long deep chasms, whose <b>edges</b> <b>shook</b> <b>and</b> fell in, throwing up clouds of sand which fell back and hissed amongst the rising water. The heavily built house shook to its foundations. Great stones were thrown up as from a volcano, some of them, great masses of hard stone, squared and grooved with implements wrought by human hands, breaking up and splitting in mid air as though riven by some infernal power. Trees near the house--and therefore presumably in some way above the hole, which sent up clouds of dust and steam and fine sand mingled, and which carried an appalling stench which sickened the spectators--were torn up by the roots and hurled into the air. By now, flames were bursting violently {{from all over the}} ruins, so dangerously that Adam caught up his wife in his arms, and ran with her from the proximity of the flames.|$|R
500|$|Disruption: Known in the Western tea {{industry}} as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", the teas are bruised or torn {{in order to}} promote and quicken oxidation. The leaves may be lightly bruised on their <b>edges</b> by <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> tossing in a bamboo tray [...] or tumbling in baskets. More extensive leaf disruption can be done by kneading, rolling, tearing, and crushing, usually by machinery. The bruising breaks down the structures inside and outside of the leaf cells and allows from the co-mingling of oxidative enzymes with various substrates, which allows for the beginning of oxidation. This also releases some of the leaf juices, which may aid in oxidation and change the taste profile of the tea.|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and whether they are associated with co-sleeping. In Japan, co-sleeping is common during infancy and early childhood. This study investigates the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4 -month-old infants in Japan. A questionnaire was administered to mothers who participated in a 4 -month health checkup program in Kamagaya City in Japan (n = 1307; valid response rate, 82 %). The questionnaire investigated the frequency of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering during the past one month, co-sleeping status, and living arrangements with grandparents, in addition to traditional risk factors such as stress due to crying. Associations between co-sleeping <b>and</b> self-reported <b>shaking</b> or smothering were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering at least one time during the past one month was 3. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 2. 4 %– 4. 3 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI, 1. 5 %– 3. 2 %), respectively. Co-sleeping was marginally associated {{with the amount of}} crying and not associated with stress due to crying. Further, co-sleeping was not associated with either self-reported shaking or smothering, although stress due to crying showed strong association with <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering. Co-sleeping was not a risk factor for <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering...|$|R
