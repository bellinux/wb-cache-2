30|$|The {{strength}} of our segmentation method is that it relies first on the depth map, on which potential targets (peaks and holes) are detected, and this is then confirmed using the motion calculated from the corresponding intensity images. Depending on the light, <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> project shadows onto the flight board which may be detected as motion on the intensity map. However, {{it is unlikely that}} a hole would be observed on the depth map in an area where there is motion because a detected motion indicates a significant change in texture. Furthermore, significant changes in texture allow matching for disparity computation in most cases and do not result in holes. This therefore constitutes the {{strength of}} our method: the combination of both disparity maps and intensity images prevents false detections that are generally triggered by the shadows of <b>flying</b> <b>bees.</b>|$|R

40|$|There is now {{increasing}} evidence that honey bees regulate their ground speed in flight by holding constant {{the speed at}} which the image of the environment moves across the eye (optic flow). We have investigated the extent to which ground speed is affected by headwinds. Honey bees were trained to enter a tunnel to forage at a sucrose feeder placed at its far end. Ground speeds in the tunnel were recorded while systematically varying the visual texture of the tunnel, and the strength of headwinds experienced by the <b>flying</b> <b>bees.</b> We found that in a flight tunnel bees used visual cues to maintain their ground speed, and adjusted their air speed to maintain a constant rate of optic flow, even against headwinds which were, at their strongest, 50 % of a bee’s maximum recorded forward velocity. Manipulation of the visual texture revealed that headwind is compensated almost fully even when the optic flow cues are very sparse and subtle, demonstrating the robustness of this visual flight control system.

3000|$|A curious {{feature in}} the home-site {{selection}} procedure by bees is that only 3 - 5 % of the bees [4] in the swarm {{have been to the}} new site and are called scout bees. So, how can these fewer bees lead the entire swarm toward the new site? After falsifying the [...] "assembly pheromone" [...] assumption [5], there have been at least two likely hypotheses, both of which show that the informed bees provide guidance information to the other bees [6]. One hypothesis is the [...] "subtle bee" [...] hypothesis and the other one is the [...] "streaker bee" [...] hypothesis. The [...] "subtle bee" [...] hypothesis suggests that informed bees do not conspicuously signal the correct travel direction but steer the whole swarm by moving toward the right direction. The [...] "streaker bee" [...] hypothesis states that the informed bees will conspicuously signal the correct travel direction by making high-speed flights. The major difference is that in the [...] "streaker bee" [...] hypothesis, the uninformed bees will {{pay more attention to the}} action of those high-speed bees, i.e., they favor the information transmitted from fast <b>flying</b> <b>bees.</b> In simulations, it was shown in [7] that in a group of both informed individuals and uninformed individuals, if each individual attempts to align with neighbors and tries to keep a certain distance from others, then the whole group can fly correctly to the destination. This policy can be used to explain the [...] "subtle bee" [...] hypothesis. On the other hand, it was shown in [8] that the [...] "streaker bee" [...] hypothesis is a plausible mechanism by simulating the case that uninformed individuals can recognize informed bees and favor alignment to these bees. Later, through photographic analysis, the work [9] showed that there are some fast <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> in the swarm, especially in the upper half of the cloud of bees. And the experiments in [9, 10] showed that those high-speed bees have greater directionality oriented toward the new nest site. Thus, though it is still uncertain whether uninformed bees follow streaker bees, it appears that uninformed <b>bees</b> follow fast <b>flying</b> <b>bees.</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{negotiating}} a narrow gap, honeybees tend to {{fly through the}} middle of the gap, balancing the distances to the boundary on either side. To investigate the basis of this "centering response,” bees were trained to fly through a tunnel {{on their way to a}} feeding site and back, while their flight trajectories were filmed from above. The wall on either side carried a visual pattern. When the patterns were stationary vertical gratings, bees tended to fly {{through the middle of}} the tunnel, i. e. along its longitudinal axis. However, when one of the gratings was in motion, <b>bees</b> <b>flying</b> in the same direction as the moving grating tended to fly closer to while <b>bees</b> <b>flying</b> in the opposite direction tended to fly closer to the stationary grating. This demonstrates, directly and unequivocally, that <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> estimate the distances of surfaces in terms of the apparent motion of their images. A series of further experiments revealed that the distance to the gratings is gauged in terms of their apparent angular speeds, and that the visual system of the bee is capable of measuring angular speed largely independently of the spatial period, intensity profile, or contrast of the grating. Thus, the motion-sensitive mechanisms mediating range perception appear to be qualitatively different from those that mediate the well-known optomotor response in insects, or those involved in motion detection and ocular tracking in ma...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that honeybees use the polarized-light pattern of the sky as a compass for navigation, there is little direct evidence that this information is actually sensed during flight. Here, we ask whether <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> can obtain compass cues derived purely from polarized light, and communicate this information to their nest-mates through the 2 ̆ 7 waggle dance 2 ̆ 7. Bees, from an observation hive with vertically oriented honeycombs, were trained to fly to a food source {{at the end of}} a tunnel, which provided overhead illumination that was polarized either parallel to the axis of the tunnel, or perpendicular to it. When the illumination was transversely polarized, bees danced in a predominantly vertical direction with waggles occurring equally frequently in the upward or the downward direction. They were thus using the polarized-light information to signal the two possible directions in which they could have flown in natural outdoor flight: either directly towards the sun, or directly away from it. When the illumination was axially polarized, the bees danced in a predominantly horizontal direction with waggles directed either to the left or the right, indicating that they could have flown in an azimuthal direction that was 90 ° to the right or to the left of the sun, respectively. When the first half of the tunnel provided axial illumination and the second half transverse illumination, bees danced along all of the four principal diagonal directions, which represent four equally likely locations of the food source based on the polarized-light information that they had acquired during their journey. We conclude that <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> are capable of obtaining and signalling compass information that is derived purely from polarized light. Furthermore, they deal with the directional ambiguity that is inherent in polarized light by signalling all of the possible locations of the food source in their dances, thus maximizing the chances of recruitment to it...|$|R

Here we investigate how this visual odometer operates when a bee flies along paths that include a vertical component. By training bees to fly to a feeder along tunnels of various three-dimensional configurations, we find that the odometric signal depends only upon the total distance travelled along the path and is independent of its three-dimensional configuration. Hence, unlike walking desert ants, which measure the distance travelled in the horizontal plane whilst traversing undulating terrain, <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> simply integrate the image motion that is experienced on the way to the goal, irrespective of the direction in which the image moves across the eyes.

A maximum likelihood model has estimated a high degree (60  % of all marked bees) of site fidelity to the source plots and a mean traveling distance of 357  m for the bees that left the plots. Additional observations on the bees’ foraging behavior suggest that some anthophorine bee species can be important pollinators in the studied habitat.

Free <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> were tested for landmark-based memory in variations on a paradigm of retroactive interference. Bees first learned Task 1, were tested on Task 1 (Test 1), then learned Task 2, and were tested again on Task 1 (Test 2). A 60 -min delay (waiting in a box) before Test 2 caused no performance decrements. If the two tasks had conflicting response requirements, (e. g., target right of a green landmark in Task 1 and left of a blue landmark in Task 2), then a strong decrement on Test 2 was found (retroactive interference effect). When response competition was minimised during training or testing, however, the decrement on Test 2 was small or nonexistent.

40|$|Freely <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> were filmed as {{they landed}} on a flat, {{horizontal}} surface, to investigate the underlying visuomotor control strategies. The results reveal that (1) landing bees approach the surface at a relatively shallow descent angle; (2) they tend to hold the angular velocity {{of the image of}} the surface constant as they approach it; and (3) the instantaneous speed of descent is proportional to the instantaneous forward speed. These characteristics reflect a surprisingly simple and effective strategy for achieving a smooth landing, by which the forward and descent speeds are automatically reduced as the surface is approached and are both close to zero at touchdown. No explicit knowledge of flight speed or height above the ground is necessary. A model of the control scheme is developed and its predictions are verified. It is also shown that, during landing, the bee decelerates continuously and {{in such a way as}} to keep the projected time to touchdown constant as the surface is approached.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, uses {{olfactory}} stimulus as important information for orienting to food sources. Several studies on olfactory-induced orientation flight have been conducted in wind tunnels and in the field. From these studies, optical sensing is used as the main information {{with the addition of}} olfactory signals and the navigational course followed by these sensory information. However, {{it is not clear how}} olfactory information is reflected in the navigation of flight. In this study, we analyzed the detailed properties of flight when oriented to an odor source in a wind tunnel. We recorded <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> with a video camera to analyze the flight area, speed, angular velocity and trajectory. After bees were trained to be attracted to a feeder, the flight trajectories with or without the olfactory stimulus located upwind of the feeder were compared. The results showed that honeybees flew back and forth in the proximity of the odor source, and the search range corresponded approximately to the odor spread area. It was also shown that the angular velocity was different inside and outside the odor spread area, and trajectories tended to be bent or curved just outside the area...|$|R
40|$|How do animals {{regulate}} self-movement despite large {{variation in}} the luminance contrast of the environment? Insects are capable of regulating flight speed based on the velocity of image motion, but the mechanisms for this are unclear. The Hassenstein–Reichardt correlator model and elaborations can accurately predict responses of motion detecting neurons under many conditions but fail to explain the apparent lack of spatial pattern and contrast dependence observed in freely <b>flying</b> <b>bees</b> and flies. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we recorded intracellularly from horizontal-sensitive (HS) motion detecting neurons in the hoverfly while displaying moving images of natural environments. Contrary to results obtained with grating patterns, we show these neurons encode the velocity of natural images largely independently of the particular image used despite a threefold range of contrast. This invariance in response to natural images is observed in both strongly and minimally motion-adapted neurons but is sensitive to artificial manipulations in contrast. Current models of these cells account for some, but not all, of the observed insensitivity to image contrast. We conclude that fly visual processing may be matched to commonalities between natural scenes, enabling accurate estimates of velocity largely independent of the particular scene...|$|R
40|$|The {{colour vision}} of bees has been {{extensively}} analysed in honeybees and bumblebees, but few studies consider the visual perception of stingless bees (Meliponini). In a five-stage experiment the preference for colour intensity and purity, and the preference for the dominant wavelength were tested by presenting four colour stimuli in each test to freely flying experienced workers of two stingless bee species, Melipona mondury and Melipona quadrifasciata. The results with bee-blue, bee-UV-blue and bee-green colours offered in four combinations of varying colour intensity and purity suggest a complex interaction between these colour traits for the determination of colour choice. Specifically, M. mondury preferred bee-UV-blue colours over bee-green, bee-blue and bee-blue-green colours while M. quadrifasciata preferred bee-green colour stimuli. Moreover in M. mondury the preferences were different if the background colour was changed from grey to green.
