5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> his power to make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or {{other aspects of the}} regime.|$|E

5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Mark came up {{with the}} music first, then I {{came up with}} the words and we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody.

5|$|Miller {{noted that}} {{although}} he wrote the play in 1947 and 1948, the play grew {{out of his life}} experiences, that included his father losing <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> the 1929 stock market crash. Miller claims that the role was actually modeled on one of his uncles.|$|E
5|$|Similar to most {{action games}} on the Sega Genesis, the plot in Alisia Dragoon is simple and short. The game goes {{straight}} into the action, tasking Alisia to kill <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> sight. After defeating the final boss, the player is treated to a cinematic cutscene of Alisia's triumphant return to her home.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{considered}} {{writing a}} third radio series {{to be based}} on his novel Life, the Universe and <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining Hitchhiker's Guide novels So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless. These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E

5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
