5000|$|The Lambert-W {{function}} was {{employed in the}} field of <b>epitaxial</b> <b>film</b> growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness.

5000|$|The overlayer {{is called}} an <b>{{epitaxial}}</b> <b>film</b> or epitaxial layer. The term epitaxy {{comes from the}} Greek roots epi (ἐπί), meaning [...] "above", and taxis (τάξις), meaning [...] "an ordered manner". It can be translated as [...] "arranging upon". For most technological applications, it is desired that the deposited material form a crystalline overlayer that has one well-defined orientation {{with respect to the}} substrate crystal structure (single-domain epitaxy).|$|E
50|$|Epitaxial films may {{be grown}} from gaseous or liquid precursors. Because the {{substrate}} {{acts as a}} seed crystal, the deposited film may lock into one or more crystallographic orientations {{with respect to the}} substrate crystal. If the overlayer either forms a random orientation with respect to the substrate or does not form an ordered overlayer, it is termed non-epitaxial growth. If an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>film</b> is deposited on a substrate of the same composition, the process is called homoepitaxy; otherwise it is called heteroepitaxy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Epitaxial</b> <b>films</b> of Fe 25 Pt 75 have {{a number}} of {{different}} magnetic phases as a function of temperature and chemical order. For example, chemically ordered <b>epitaxial</b> <b>films</b> have two distinct antiferromagnetic phases at temperatures below similar to 160 K and exhibit paramagnetism above that temperature. In sharp contrast, chemically disordered <b>epitaxial</b> <b>films</b> are ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature that is greater than 400 K.

The nanocrystalline film suffers from in-plane compressive stress imposed by atomic peening processes.
