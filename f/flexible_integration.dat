50|$|OPC (see OLE for process control) is preferably {{used as the}} interface; however, various OPC servers {{might be}} used {{depending}} on the control units to be integrated. Furthermore, a driver-based interface is available for non OPC-capable systems. This ensures simple and <b>flexible</b> <b>integration</b> of numerous control systems, e.g. from Mitsubishi Electric, Allen-Bradley, Siemens, VIPA and others. Various reporting functions enable selective access to recorded process and material data.|$|E

The network publishes joint {{publications}} on topical issues (e.g. <b>flexible</b> <b>integration,</b> Europe of citizens). EPIN focuses on institutional reform of the Union, but other issues are also addressed. The network follows preparations for the European elections, the EU's communication policy, and the political dynamics after enlargement, as well as EU foreign policy and justice and home affairs.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{integration of}} configuration sys-tem development with industrial software development {{is crucial for}} a successful implementation of a Mass Customization strategy. On the one hand, configuration knowledge bases must be easy to develop and maintain due to continuously changing product assortments. On the other hand, <b>flexible</b> <b>integrations</b> into existing enterprise applications, e-marketplaces and different facets of supply chain settings must be supported. This paper shows how the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) as an industrial framework for model development and interchange {{can serve as a}} foundation for standardized configuration know-ledge representation, thus enabling knowledge sharing in heterogeneous environments. Using UML/OCL as stan-dard configuration knowledge representation languages, the representation of configuration domain-specific modeling concepts within MDA is shown and a formal semantics for these concepts is provided which allows a common understanding and interpretation of configuration task descriptions...|$|R

The network provides a platform for researchers and policy analysts to establish personal links, exchange knowledge and collaborate on EU-related issues. Members bring their national perspectives to bear on the issues tackled and through collaboration they contribute to establish a 'European added-value' (e.g. on EU communication, <b>flexible</b> <b>integration).</b> By doing so they strengthen a common European dimension in the national debates on Europe.|$|E

40|$|Our paper {{proceeds}} as follows: As a {{point of}} departure, part two highlights the heterogeneity among EU member states following the recent enlargement, while part three reviews three main alternative conceptions of <b>flexible</b> <b>integration</b> as they were discussed in political circles. Part four applies Buchanan's and Tullock's Calculus of Consent (1962) to the tension between deepening and widening the EU. Part five introduces basic elements of the economic theory of clubs, analyzes {{the notion of the}} EU as a club and examines <b>flexible</b> <b>integration</b> in a club-theoretical framework. Part six considers several alternative integration models in view of the conclusions of both club theory and constitutional economics, while part seven focuses more specifically on a club-of-clubs approach that we tend to favour as an ideal-type model for a European Union of the future. Part eight evaluates the relative weaknesses and strengths of <b>flexible</b> <b>integration</b> according to the club-of-clubs approach and part nine advocates some further institutional recommendations before part ten concludes.

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of modes of {{governance}} and constellations of interdependence, EU research policy offers ideal conditions for the flexible inclusion of non-member states: it is based on transgovernmental coordination through policy networks rather than supranational legislation, it follows scientific rather than political imperatives, and cooperation is in the interest of both the EU and of Switzerland. This article analy- ses the degree to which these factors have allowed for Switzerland’s inclusion into the regulatory and organisational aspects of EU research policy, and highlights the limits of such <b>flexible</b> sectoral <b>integration...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>flexible</b> <b>integration</b> may even {{strengthen}} {{and promote the}} deepening of the Union. In so doing, it categorizes the theories of <b>flexible</b> <b>integration</b> and analyzes how the current Treaty of the European Union deals {{with the issue of}} flexibility. Then, focusing on the case of institutional development for European space collaboration-a European institution outside of the EU-it discusses the successful implementation of flexible institutions. The main argument of this paper is that the institutions of European integration {{have to be able to}} accommodate different interests and objectives among member states. Flexibility has to focus on the political will rather than the capacity of the members. The current Treaty arrangement for flexibility is not sufficient to accommodate the differences, and, therefore, we shall learn from the lessons of European space collaboration...|$|E

Additionally, outputs from the motor system can be used to modify the sensory system's response to future stimuli.

To produce the desired flexibility it's probable that nervous systems employ the use of internal models and efference copies.|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} {{anatomical}} substrates and "principles'' for integrating inputs from separate sensory surfaces has yielded divergent findings.

These canonical operations subsume multisensory integration into a fundamental set of principles as to how the brain integrates all sorts of information, and they are being used proactively and adaptively. We illustrate this proposition by unifying recent findings from different research themes such as timing, behavioral goal, and experience-related differences in integration...|$|R
