40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a method for nonlinear, nonstationary data processing, namely the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) in traditional vibration-based approaches to characterizing structural damage and shows the frequency signature of local structural damage in nonstationary vibration recordings. In particular, following the review of traditional approaches to characterizing structural damage from nonstationary vibration recordings, this study first offers the justifications of the HHT as an alternative and complementary data process in addressing the nonstationarity of the vibration. With the use of recordings from controlled field vibration tests of substructures in the Trinity River Relief Bridge in Texas in its intact, minor- and severe-damage pile states, this study then shows that the HHT-based approach can single out some natural frequencies of the structure from a mixed frequency content in recordings that also contain the time-dependent excitation and noise frequencies. Subsequently, this study exposes that the frequency downshift for the damaged pile relative to the undamaged one is an <b>indicative</b> <b>index</b> for the damage extent. The above results are also validated by an ANSYS model-based analysis. Finally, a comprehensive HHT-based characterization of structural damage is discussed, and the potential use for cost-effective, efficient structural damage diagnosis procedures and health-monitoring systems is provided.

40|$|Abstract: At Kharrouba (near Tunis City in {{northern}} Tunisia), {{on the southern}} margin of the Tethyan realm, the Paleocene–Eocene (P–E) transition interval deposition is continuous and complete. Based on high-resolution analysis and quantitative data of planktonic and benthic foraminifera at the Kharrouba section, this transition interval records expanded deposition of the relevant standard planktonic foraminiferal biozones with <b>indicative</b> <b>index</b> species i. e. : Morozovella velascoensis for the latest Paleocene P 5 zone, and Acarinina sibaiyaensis for the earliest Eocene E 1 zone, Pseudohastigerina wilcoxensis for the E 2 zone, Morozovella marginodentata for the E 3 zone and Morozovella formosa for the E 4 zone. This complete section contains benthic foraminiferal assemblages which include calcareous and agglutinated cosmopolitan deep-water species (DWBF). Among the calcareous deep benthic foraminifera Aragonia velascoensis Anomalinoides rubiginosus, Oridorsalis umbonatus, Nuttallides truempyi, Pullenia coryelli and Tappanina selmensis, are relatively abundant. These species are the main representatives of the Velasco fauna indicative of a bathyal-abyssal environment. Moreover, within this section, the agglutinated species e. g., Glomospira charoides, Karrerulina horrida, Rzehakina epigona, Ammodiscus spp. and Gaudryina pyramidata, assumed to be restricted to deep-sea palaeoenvironments, constitute an important proportion of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages.

40|$|Coal {{has been}} {{ensuring}} energy {{security and stability}} {{for a long period}} of time in terms of increasing exploitation and excavation of high rank coals, thus, leaving behind huge unattended low rank coal reserves. Furthermore, thermal systems were designed on the basis of physico-chemical properties of high rank coals. However, temporarily, low rank coals were abandoned as these had been found to be associated with high moisture contents and low calorific values, which posed their unsuitability for application in conventional thermal systems. The present study was aimed at investigating and exploring the prospects of possible intervention of biotechnological approaches into conventional fuel sciences for the extraction of alternative fuel options like methane and value added products such as humic acids. In this regard, fungal degradation of coal can serve as a pretreatment step in order to make coal a suitable substrate for biological beneficiation. Thirty one (31) coal samples, originating from eight coal areas of Pakistan and majority from Thar coal field, were subjected to detailed chemical analyses including maceral analysis and these indicated that geological stage of Thar coal, which might be susceptible to biological modification. A fungal strain MW 1, identified as Penicillium chrysogenum on the basis of fungal ITS sequences, was isolated from a core sample of sub-bituminous coal and twelve (12) low rank coal samples were treated with this isolate for further studies. Liquid extracts were analyzed through Excitation-Emission Matrix Spectroscopy (EEMS) to obtain qualitative estimates of solubilized coal; these analyses exhibited the release of complex organic moieties. In addition, analysis of these extracts, based on Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), confirmed the presence of single ring aromatics, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic nitrogen compounds and some aliphatics. Subsequently, the released organics were subjected to a bioassay WBC- 2, based on mixed bacterial consortium, containing methanogenic and non-methanogenic types, for the generation of methane, which conferred the potential application of fungal degradation as pretreatment. The native coal samples were also subjected to WBC- 2 culture based bioassay fordetermining the methane generation. Upon incubation with WBC- 2 culture under anaerobic conditions, methane was produced from Thar coal samples in the range of 3. 7 to 23. 2 Æ’Ã�moles per gram of coal (2. 13 to 16. 33 scf/ton of coal). The susceptibility of methane generation from Thar coal samples may also be considered as an <b>indicative</b> <b>index</b> of the possible presence of biogenic coalbed methane (CBM) in Thar coal seams. Vitrinite reflectance values for Thar coal samples, which were less than 0. 4 %, corresponded to biogenic hydrocarbon generation range. In addition, the residual coal after fungal pretreatment was processed for the extraction of humic acids from Pakistani brown coal. Extracted humic acid were analyzed on the basis of UV-Vis Spectroscopy for determining the E 4 /E 6 ratio, which appeared to be in the range of 6 to 7. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) showed typical intensified absorption bands related to aliphatic stretching (2917 - 3335 cm- 1) and C=O stretching of COOH and ketones (1607 - 1698 cm- 1). Conclusively, on the basis of present study and some of the previous reports, a laboratory model for biotransformation of coal into methane was proposed, which gave an insight of the underlying mechanisms operative in this conversion. This proposed model provided a route for comparing two types of initial biological degradation approaches i. e. bacterial and fungal. Besides, fungal mediated degradation may be prospected for extracting chemical entities like humic acids from brown coals with high huminite content as shown by petrographic studies...|$|E

After 25 -month-old mice received basal diet together with 300 mg/l acetyl L-carnitine in the drinking water for 8 weeks, these levels were fully restored to those found in younger animals. A partial restoration was found when old animals received basal diet supplemented with 200 ppm melatonin in the diet.

In this study, airborne hyperspectral data {{were used to assess}} the response of deciduous species (dominated by European beech and Sessile and Pedunculate oak) to water stress during a summery dry spell. After masking canopy gaps, shaded crown areas and non-deciduous species, potentially <b>indicative</b> spectral <b>indices,</b> the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Chlorophyll Index (CI), were analyzed with respect to available maps of site-specific soil moisture regimes. PRI provided an important indication of site-specific photosynthetic stress on leaf level in relation to limitations in soil water availability. The CI, MSI and NDWI revealed statistically significant differences in total chlorophyll and water concentration at the canopy level. However, after reducing the canopy effects by normalizing these indices with respect to the structure-sensitive simple ratio (SR) vegetation index, it was not yet possible to identify site-specific concentration differences in leaf level at this early stage of the drought. The selected indicators were also tested with simulated EnMAP and Sentinel- 2 data (derived from the original airborne data set). While PRI proved to be useful also in the spatial resolution of EnMAP (GSD = 30 m), {{this was not the case}} with Sentinel- 2, owing to the lack of adequate spectral bands; the remaining indicators (MSI, CI, SR) were also successfully produced with Sentinel- 2 data at superior spatial resolution (GSD = 10 m).

Most previous work has assumed that changes in these parameters require changes in either source lithology or composition based on experiments that suggest manganese is slightly incompatible during melting and that the iron/manganese ratio is fixed by the presence of olivine. However, the presence of volatiles in the mantle drives melting at lower temperatures and with different compositions than is seen in volatile-free systems, and thus the partitioning behavior of Fe and Mn may in fact vary. We have produced silicate liquids in equilibrium with a peridotite assemblage under hydrous conditions at 3 GPa pressure which show that manganese can also be unexpectedly compatible in garnet at 1375 °C and Mn partitioning between solids and liquids can be strongly affected by temperature and liquid composition. The compatibility of Mn in garnet provides a mechanism for large variations of Mn {{contents and}} the Fe/Mn ratio in silicate melts solely involving melting of mantle peridotite with fairly small compositional changes. Correlations between Mn variations and other <b>indices</b> <b>indicative</b> of melting in the presence of garnet may provide a means of more completely understanding the role of garnet at high pressures in peridotite melting.

40|$|One hundred fifty-four {{discrete}} non-nuclear Ultra-Luminous X-ray (ULX) sources, with spectroscopically-determined intrinsic X-ray luminosities> 10 39 ergs s − 1, {{are identified}} in 82 galaxies observed with Chandra’s Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer. Source positions, X-ray luminosities, and spectral and timing characteristics are tabulated. Statistical comparisons between these X-ray properties {{and those of}} the weaker discrete sources in the same fields (mainly neutron star and stellarmass black hole binaries) are made. Sources above ∼ 10 38 ergs s − 1 display similar spatial, spectral, color, and variability distributions. In particular, there is no compelling evidence in the sample for a new and distinct class of X-ray object such as the intermediate-mass black holes. 83 % of ULX candidates have spectra that can be described as absorbed power laws with index 〈Γ 〉 = 1. 74 and column density 〈NH 〉 = 2. 24 × 10 21 cm − 2, or ∼ 5 times the average Galactic column. About 20 % of the ULXs have much steeper <b>indices</b> <b>indicative</b> of a soft, and likely thermal, spectrum. The locations of ULXs in their host galaxies are strongly peaked towards their galaxy centers. The deprojected radial distribution of the ULX candidates is somewhat steeper than an exponential disk, indistinguishable from that of the weaker sources. About 5 – 15 % of ULX candidates are variable during the Chandra observation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increasing}} number of case reports indicate potential nephrotoxicity of 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA), which shares similarities with the chemical structures of both phenacetin and acetylsalicylic acid. AIM: In a point prevalence study the occurrence of sensitive <b>indices</b> <b>indicative</b> of early kidney malfunction was assessed in outpatients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Routine indices of kidney function (creatinine clearance, urinary protein content, pH, electrolytes, and microscopy) were investigated in 223 patients with inflammatory bowel disease as well as sensitive markers of glomerular or tubular dysfunction (microproteinuria by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), urinary concentrations of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, alpha 1 -microglobulin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), and albumin). Histories of exposure to 5 -ASA were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: Patients receiving high amounts of 5 -ASA, both actual {{as well as on}} a lifetime basis, showed an increased prevalence of tubular proteinuria by SDS-PAGE. Raised values for urinary AP and GGT indicate proximal tubular epithelial cells as the source. All other kidney function tests were normal. Analysis of covariates indicated strong associations between disease activity and size of 5 -ASA doses as well as alterations in kidney tubular function. CONCLUSION: The possibility exists that high doses of 5 -ASA may be associated with proximal tubular proteinuria. This point prevalence study cannot dissect the possible impact of chronic inflammation from high dose 5 -ASA treatment and further prospective studies are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Genetic diversity, {{within and}} among natural populations at 32 sites, of the {{long-lived}} temperate rainforest Huon pine tree Lagarostrobos franklinii {{was assessed using}} isozymes. Overall, genetic diversity, based on six enzyme loci, was low (A = 1 · 6, P = 46 %), both within and among populations (Fst = 0 · 095). The most isolated sites (Yellow Creek, Spero River, Newall Creek, Mt Read) deviated significantly from expected allelic frequencies and/or had the greatest genetic distances from other sites. Most of these isolated sites are currently unprotected. Genotype frequencies within most sites (20 out of 32) deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations (p < 0 · 0015) and had high fixation <b>indexes</b> <b>indicative</b> of effective inbreeding. The high levels of inbreeding observed by these measures at some sites did not reflect isolation from gene flow. The most similar pairs of populations were located in {{the headwaters of the}} three major habitat catchments, which originate within close geographic proximity of one another. Over 90 % of individuals at Mt Read, the highest altitude site known, were genetically identical. This, combined with other evidence, suggests that the population at this site is principally vegetatively derived and may be exceptionally old. Inbreeding and low diversity {{does not appear to have}} affected the species' ability to persist for long periods...|$|R
40|$|Elsevier use only: Received date here; revised date here; {{accepted}} date here Graphite {{consists of}} graphene layers in an AB (Bernal) stacking arrangement. The introduction of defects {{can reduce the}} coupling between the top graphene layers and the bulk crystal producing new electronic states that reflect the degree of coupling. We employ low temperature high magnetic field scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to access these states and study their evolution with the degree of coupling. STS in magnetic field directly probes the dimensionality of electronic states. Thus two dimensional states produce a discrete series of Landau levels while three dimensional states form Landau bands providing {{a clear distinction between}} completely decoupled top layers and ones that are coupled to the substrate. We show that the completely decoupled layers are characterized by a single sequence of Landau levels with square root dependence on field and level <b>index</b> <b>indicative</b> of massless Dirac fermions. In contrast weakly coupled bilayers produce special sequences reflecting the degree of coupling, and multilayers produce sequences reflecting the coexistence of massless and massive Dirac fermions. In addition we show that the graphite surface is soft and that an STM tip can be quite invasive when brought too close to the surface {{and that there is a}} characteristic tip-sample distance beyond which the effect of sample tip interaction is negligible...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{internal}} structural properties of 37 long duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our {{goal is to}} gain insights {{in the type of}} galaxies that gives rise to GRBs, and the relationship of GRB hosts to high-redshift galaxies selected through more traditional photometric methods. We measure structural properties of our sample from Hubble Space Telescope observations obtained after the GRB afterglow faded. Fitting exponential disk (typical for spirals) and r 1 / 4 (typical for ellipticals) models to the surface brightness profiles of eight z < 1. 2 bright host galaxies, we find that the disk model is slightly preferred for most hosts, although two galaxies are fit best with an r 1 / 4 profile. We furthermore measure the central concentrations and asymmetries of all 37 host galaxies using the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness) system, and compare with values for galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field, and systems present on the gamma-ray burst host images. Our first main conclusion is that GRB hosts exhibit a surprisingly high diversity of galaxy types. A significant fraction (68 %) of host galaxies are situated in a region of the concentration-asymmetry diagram occupied by spirals or peculiar/merging galaxies. Twelve hosts (32 %) are situated in the region occupied by elliptical galaxies, having high concentration <b>indices</b> <b>indicative</b> of early-types or early types in formation. Thes...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the previous studies of thyroid abnormalities in bipolar patients was conducted in populations containing various proportions of lithium-treated subjects. In the present study, we sought {{to determine whether there}} exist differences in hypothyroid profile between lithium-free and -treated bipolar patients. Bipolar patients never treated with lithium and carbamazepine (n = 78) and those currently in lithium therapy (n = 53) were included in this study. Serum concentrations of total thyroxine (T 4), total triiodothyronine (T 3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were compared between lithium-free and -treated patients. The rate of hypothyroidism in lithium-free patients was significantly lower than those treated with lithium (6. 3 %- 10. 8 % vs. 28. 0 %- 32. 1 %). Significant changes in the three thyroid <b>indices</b> <b>indicative</b> of hypothyroidism were consistently associated with longer illness duration in lithium-free manic patients, but with greater severity of mania and more mood episodes in their lithium-treated counterparts. In lithium-free depressed patients, more episodes were associated with lower T 4 levels; whereas in their lithium-treated counterparts, longer illness duration was associated with higher TSH levels and females with lower T 3 levels. These results suggest that bipolar patients with and without lithium exposure differ in prevalence and association of hypothyroidism and may have different response to thyroid hormone therapy. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|The {{observer}} {{maintained a}} standard designated route in a {{west to east}} direction, counting each of the campus’ five buildings {{during the course of}} the research period. Observations were aided binoculars, digital camera and dictaphone, later transcribed onto data sheets. Double counts of individuals taking off and perching on the same building was taken into consideration and avoided. As the pigeons were wild and free roaming, the exact number of pigeons on campus could not be determined. An increase or decrease in the number of pigeons counted was in essence a reflection of the unknown population size and directly correlated to an increase or decrease in pigeon presence on campus (Gregory et al. 2005). Presence was represented as an index to monitor the extent of the increases or decreases as actual numbers could not be attained through the methodology implemented. As the index reflects a portion of the pigeon population, a portion which may be change over time, methodology was therefore standardised to mitigate variability (Johnson 2008). The paper will therefore refer to indices to convey the extent of the pigeon presence, and its changes over time. The results of the baseline year were therefore interpreted as an index of pigeon population size. The use of the term ‘population’ in this study does not refer to a biological population as a demographic unit but rather as a population <b>index</b> <b>indicative</b> of the census technique employed.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} rest-frame optical morphologies of {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) host galaxies at 1. 5 < z < 3, using {{near-infrared}} imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3, the first such study of AGN host galaxies at these redshifts. The AGNs are X-ray-selected from the Chandra Deep Field South and have typical luminosities of 10 [superscript 42] erg s[superscript – 1]<L [subscript X] < 10 [superscript 44] erg s[superscript – 1]. Accreting black holes in this luminosity and redshift range account for a substantial {{fraction of the total}} space density and black hole mass growth over cosmic time; they thus represent an important mode of black hole growth in the universe. We find that the majority (~ 80 %) of the host galaxies of these AGNs have low Sérsic <b>indices</b> <b>indicative</b> of disk-dominated light profiles, suggesting that secular processes govern a significant fraction of the cosmic growth of black holes. That is, many black holes in the present-day universe grew much of their mass in disk-dominated galaxies and not in early-type galaxies or major mergers. The properties of the AGN host galaxies are furthermore indistinguishable from their parent galaxy population and we find no strong evolution in either effective radii or morphological mix between z ~ 2 and z ~ 0. 05.
