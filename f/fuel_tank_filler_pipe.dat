5000|$|The [...] "radiator" [...] cap was {{actually}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler,</b> which led to problems when mechanics unfamiliar with air-cooled cars topped off the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> with water.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> was {{relocated}} {{from the}} fender {{to the center}} of the trunk. The trunk lid had to be shortened to accommodate this change.|$|R
50|$|Modern cars often feature remote {{opening of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> flap using an {{electric}} motor or cable release. For both convenience and security, many modern <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from {{the outside of the}} car.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the Electrosport was differentiated from regular production Hornets by a one-piece solid fiberglass body-colored panel {{in place of the}} AMC's silver and black plastic grille. Additional gauges were added to the instrument panel. The Hornet’s gas cap covered the three-prong plug mounted in the former <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> hole to which an extension cord connected to 220-volt AC power.|$|R
5000|$|... 1961-1965 : Engine specs {{amended to}} a {{normally}} aspirated engine of between 1300 cc and 1500 cc, no compressors allowed, minimum weight set at 450 kg, pump fuel only, automatic starter, roll bar required, double braking system mandatory, standardised seatbelt anchorage, fire protection for <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> <b>fillers</b> and breathers, FIA begin to organise safety inspections (previously done by local authorities), protective helmet and overalls obligatory, flag signalling code established.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> {{neck and}} {{evaporative}} canister {{are made of}} stainless steel. Both the fuel pump and fuel filter are completely sealed inside the gas tank and require a complete replacement of the gas tank if either the fuel pump or filter fail.|$|R
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles {{depending on the type}} of fuel required. The <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded <b>fuel.</b> The <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries leaded fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|R
40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> neck. If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the filler neck. In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the filler neck of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the filler neck, the docking element is docked onto the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|R
5000|$|The later Mk IIs and {{approximately}} the first 4,000 Mk IIIs had a later type of [...] "beetle back" [...] {{with an additional}} small window on the left front side and windows in both doors. A canvas roof was mounted on a cruciform steel frame over the crew compartment, {{and there were two}} square vents in the roof behind the canvas section. The vehicle also had larger <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> and <b>filler</b> cap surrounds.|$|R
5000|$|Mazda began {{producing}} the Festiva as the [...] "Mazda 121" [...] for Australia and Europe in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan. The 121 ended production in 1990, and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991. From October 1991, Ford Australia began importing {{the car as}} the [...] "Ford Festiva" [...] from Kia's South Korean production facility. Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only. From January 1993, a Festiva three-door, badged [...] "Festiva Trio" [...] was launched in Australia. Both versions were powered by the overhead camshaft carbureted 1.3-liter B3 engine with the five-speed manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional for the five-door. Standard equipment in Australia included an AM/FM radio, tachometer, intermittent windscreen wipers, remote releases for the rear door and <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> door, with air-conditioning available as an option. Ford discontinued the Festiva in the Australian market in March 1994.|$|R
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>filler.</b> A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|R
5000|$|For 1936, at the 29th Paris Motor Show, in October 1935, various {{modifications}} were on show. [...] At {{the front}} painted front grilles replaced chrome ones and the headlight covers were restyled. [...] The {{changes at the}} back were more practical and involved an opening luggage hatch/lid: {{it was no longer}} necessary to clamber over the back seats to get at the luggage space {{at the rear of the}} passenger cabin (although the overall size of the luggage locker remained at this stage rather restricted). [...] The opening boot/trunk lid made it necessary to reposition the rear-license plate, previously under most circumstances centrally mounted just above the bumper, and now mounted on the rear-wing on the left side. [...] On the original cars it had been possible to access the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> using capped <b>filler</b> openings on either side, but now the left fuel filler cap was removed, and filling the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> had to be done using the filler on the right side. Two months later the radical [...] "Pausodyne" [...] suspension was modified, now incorporating conical rubber rings at the front.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1972, the E38 {{option was}} {{superseded}} {{by the more}} powerful and greatly refined four-speed transmission E49 option. This drew comments from Wheels such as, [...] "The raw quivering power is instantaneously on tap and with a ratio for every conceivable situation the Charger just storms through. It would take a Ferrari Daytona with racing driver Jackie Ickx at the wheel to stay with one". All E49s came with a Track Pack, 21 of which featured the huge <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> with dual <b>fillers.</b> The E49 six pack engine came with a baffled sump, tuned length headers, special shot-peened crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, rings, cam, valve springs, a twin plate clutch {{and of course the}} triple 45 mm dual throat Weber carburetors. Chrysler quoted this engine as producing [...] which, in a 1372 kg car, made for rapid acceleration.|$|R
40|$|Premature {{shut-off}} (PSO) of {{the fuel}} dispenser nozzle during automotive <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> refuelling {{is considered to be}} a nuisance. PSO occurs when the nozzle stops before the automotive <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> is completely full. The physics involved in the PSO process is complex and poses a significant challenge in the design of an automotive <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> system. A preliminary study is presented which indicates that a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solution of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> filling process for a complete three-dimensional geometry is impractical due to excessive computational time. A hybrid modeling method is investigated to address this problem. In the hybrid model, the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> system is divided into a number of subsystems each with its own specific model. A lumped parameter model is developed to simulate the storage tank and vent tubes while a three-dimensional CFD model is employed to simulate the complex multiphase flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe.</b> The lumped parameter model accounts for vapour generation in the tank. The 3 -D multiphase flow model is coupled with the lumped parameter model through the User Defined Function in a CFD program, FLUENT. The model is also modified to consider the effect of tank expansion and that of the variation of tank shape. It is found that the experimental results of multiphase flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> and the <b>tank</b> dome pressure are well predicted through the CFD simulation using the hybrid modeling method. The tank expansion during the period of fuel filling does not significantly affect the flow field. The variation in tank shape, however, can have a significant influence on the flow field. It is also found that a 72. 0...|$|R
50|$|On Saturday 22 March 2008, Abbott had a {{spectacular}} 100+mph crash in the Rob Austin Racing Ginetta G50 {{in the opening}} round of the 2008 British GT Championship at Oulton Park. After being tagged by Peter Snowdon's Aston Martin Abbott struck the barriers {{on the outside of}} the circuit between Old Hall and Cascades corners at unabated speed. The car flipped several times end over end, clearing the safety barriers, before coming to rest upside down where it burst into flames. The fire was caused by the roof skin being ripped off in the force of the accident, in the process this also ripped off the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipes</b> from the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> As it was near the beginning of the race the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was near full, when the car came to rest upside down the fuel load leaked quickly into the car.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{different}} types of fuel have specially sized of nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps {{is supposed to be}} larger so that it cannot fit into the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel pumps at auto islands have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles. Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the fill pipe on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [...] "mis-fueling". Some diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.|$|R

3000|$|The {{crashworthiness}} of helicopter <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> {{is vital}} to the survivability of the passengers and structures. In order to understand and improve the crashworthiness of the soft <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> of helicopter during the crash, this paper investigated the dynamic behavior of the nylon woven fabric composite <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> striking on the ground. A fluid–structure interaction finite element model of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> based on the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method was constructed to elucidate the dynamic failure behavior. The drop impact tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation. Good agreement was achieved between the experimental and numerical results of the impact force with the ground. The influences of the impact velocity, the impact angle, the thickness of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> wall and the volume fraction of water on the dynamic responses of the dropped <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> were studied. The results indicated that the corner of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> is the most vulnerable location during the impact with ground.|$|R
