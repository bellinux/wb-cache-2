40|$|This paper {{presents}} ESSR (Enhanced Simulated annealing for Single-row Routing) {{model for}} solving the single-row routing problem. The main objective in {{this problem is}} to produce a realization that minimizes both the street congestion {{and the number of}} <b>doglegs.</b> Simulated annealing (SA) is a stochastic, hill-climbing and gradient-descent technique based on the statistical properties of particles undergoing thermal annealing. By performing slow cooling, the nets in the single-row routing problem align themselves according to a configuration with the lowest energy. The model has been known to produce reasonably good solutions for many NP-complete optimization problems, such as the single-row routing problem. In ESSR, our strategy is to minimize both the street congestion and the number of interstreet crossings (<b>doglegs)</b> by expressing a single energy function as their collective properties. This objective is achieved by representing the energy as the absolute sum of the heights of the net segments. To speed up convergence, we pivot the street congestion value while having the energy drops directly proportional to the number of <b>doglegs.</b> This action has the effect of minimizing the number of <b>doglegs</b> as the energy stabilizes. Our simulation work on ESSR produces optimal results in most cases for both the street congestion and the number of <b>doglegs.</b> Our experimental results compare well against results obtained from our earlier model (SRR- 7) and two other methods reported in the literature. ...|$|R
25|$|The Fort Thompson {{line that}} had been set up by General Hill {{extended}} only from the river to the railroad. They ended on the right in a brickyard that would figure prominently in the fighting. Because the land farther to the right was fairly firm and would allow his position to be flanked, General Branch decided to extend the line beyond the railroad and end it in a swamp. This just about doubled the length of the defensive line. He made a major blunder in laying out the line, however. In haste to complete the extension and faced with an exasperating shortage of labor, he decided to use a small creek as a natural part of the line. This creek intersected the railroad at a point some 150 yards (135 meters) up from the brickyard. The line of breastworks therefore had a <b>dogleg</b> in its center.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on {{the other}} side, General Branch had put his regiments into the line. From his left, at Fort Thompson, to the brickyard on his right, were the 27th, 37th, 7th, and 35th North Carolina regiments. His reserve was the 33rd Regiment. The right flank of the 35th was {{anchored}} in a brickyard kiln that was loopholed for artillery. The entire line beyond the railroad was occupied by a single regiment, the 26th North Carolina, plus a few companies of cavalry. The gap in his line created by the <b>dogleg</b> at the railroad was covered only by his weakest unit, a militia battalion with only two weeks of training, and armed with shotguns and hunting rifles. To give them additional support, he ordered up a two-gun battery of 24-pounders to the kiln, {{but they were not}} mounted when they came under attack. The First Brigade of the Union Army opposed them from the river to the railroad; right to left, the units were the 25th, 24th, 27th, and 23rd Massachusetts, and the 10th Connecticut. The Beaufort Road ran through the center of this line, and here General Foster placed the howitzers that had been dragged along.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010, ISC and the Avondale City Council {{announced}} plans for a $100 million long-term development for Phoenix Raceway. $15 million would go towards repaving the track {{for the first time}} since 1990 and building a new media center. The plans also include a reconfiguration of the track. The front stretch was widened from 52 feet to , the pit stalls were changed from asphalt to concrete, the <b>dogleg</b> (between Turn 2 and Turn 3) was moved outward by , tightening the turn radius of the <b>dogleg</b> from 800 feet to 500 feet (152 m). Along with the other changes, progressive banking was added to the turns: Turns 1 and 2, which had 11 degrees of banking, changed to 10 degrees on the bottom and 11 degrees on the top. Turns 3 and 4, which had 9 degrees of banking, changed to 8 degrees on the bottom and 9 on the top. Project leader Bill Braniff, Senior Director of Construction for North American Testing Corporation (NATC), a subsidiary of Phoenix Raceway’s parent company International Speedway Corporation, said [...] "All of the changes – including the adjustment of the dog-leg – will be put in place in order to present additional opportunities for drivers to race side-by-side. We’re very confident that we’ll have multi-groove racing at Phoenix from Day 1 because of the variable banking that will be implemented.” The infield road course was also sealed off and removed from use, making Phoenix Raceway an oval-only facility.

40|$|International audienceA new {{drill pipe}} {{buckling}} model provided excellent predictions for each full-scale buckling test performed, {{not only in}} terms of deformed buckling shape but also in terms of weight transfer. Existing models, on the other hand, failed to predict observed drill pipe buckling behavior. This is the first time in the drilling industry that a buckling model was successfully validated in the field, and this model can predict realistically the onset and severity of buckling for any 3 D trajectory. Many articles discuss buckling inside a wellbore but an increasing number of field observations suggest that existing buckling theories fail to predict buckling phenomenon such as lockup. Indeed, existing buckling theories generally assume that the wellbore is idealistically perfect without any <b>doglegs.</b> Recent advancements in drillstring mechanics modeling have demonstrated that <b>doglegs,</b> friction, and rotation affect greatly the buckling phenomenon.
