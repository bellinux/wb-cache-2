He opined that: [...] "The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical {{and the fact that he}} was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>perfect</b> sense." [...] James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was [...] "great" [...] to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, actor Tom Price states {{that one of the}} original producers had originally wanted to kill Andy off in the first series as he was such a peripheral character. Executive producer Julie Gardner felt that it suited to have Andy return later in the series as it maintains a sense of continuity. She believes that there's a palpable relationship between Gwen and Andy. Director Brian Kelly opines that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>perfect</b> sense for Andy to return in episode thirteen as [...] "he is the person who would phone Gwen" [...] in a crisis situation. Eve Myles, who portrays Gwen, believes that Price conveys the humorous aspects of Andy's character [...] "fantastically", which enables her as an actress to understand the friendship between the characters. Myles also feels that Andy plays a crucial part in reminding viewers of Gwen's development; when he reappears [...] "it takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Price enumerates that by the second series Andy is used by the production team as a [...] "pressure valve" [...] to relieve tension.|$|E
2500|$|Xylophones {{are widely}} used in music of west and central Africa. The name marimba stems from Bantu marimba or malimba, 'xylophone'. According to some Western sources, the word 'marimba' is formed from ma 'many' and rimba 'single-bar xylophone,' however {{the use of the}} term marimba and/or {{derivative}} terms is not present in any West African language. The instrument itself is present, but is called balafon or heri in Mali and/or Guinea, while it is known as gyil among the Akan peoples in and around Ghana. The word marimba and derivative words is used widely in East, Central and Southern Africa. A survey of the literature on the African marimba and related instruments, like the Xylorimba, likembe and ilimba indicate a relationship between the word marimba and the various lamellaphones found all over Central and East Africa. Other sources credit the creation of the marimba and the kalimba to Queen Marimba of the Wakambi people, who live south of Lake Victoria. In the Shona language [...] "imba" [...] means song. Kuimba is to sing. Marimba, is said to be the [...] "mother of song" [...] and the creator of all the instruments, including the marimba. Mama means mother in Kiswahili, so <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>perfect</b> sense that the word mother would be combined with the word [...] "imba" [...] which is the unconjugated verb for 'sing'. The karimba is also said to have been created by Queen Marimba. In much of East & Central Africa the karimba is seen as a hand-held version of the marimba.|$|E
