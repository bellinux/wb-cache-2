The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an eco-friendly textiles to decrease environmental pollution and to be harmless for human health by investigating how the natural chorangak liquid treatment affects the changes of mechanical properties and the hand of silk fabrics according to different treatment conditions. Treatment was varied with various temperatures (85 ℃, 90 ℃, 95 ℃) for 90 seconds after degumming. The results were as follows: 1) The natural chorangak liquid is the most effective at the ratio of glacial acid 200 ml with eggshell 20 g minimizing the time limit and sludge reduction. Its treatment of silk fabrics is optimized at 90 ℃ for 90 seconds with 25 % conc. after degumming when considering tenacity and elongation. 2) After the treatment, tenacity and elongation of specimen are increased compared with those of degummed silk fabrics. 3) After analyzing the effect of the treatment on the characteristic values of basic mechanical properties of silk fabrics, mechanical properties (tensile, bending, shearing, compression, surface) are overall improved. The properties of thickness and weight are increased as well. 4) Based on the clear analysis on effects of the treatment on the mechanical properties and the hand of silk fabrics, the level of THV was enhanced from good to excellent. Therefore, chorangak liquid can be utilized satisfactorily as a new finishing agent for developing eco-friendly textiles...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{ethical and}} {{environmental}} aspects of apparel manufacturing are given significant importance in many European countries. The major importance {{has been given}} to environmental wellbeing, Fair Trade & social welfare. Because of such socially responsible and moral aspects, popularity of Eco-Friendly textile is being observed in the European world lately. This is where its practices are being adopted by Textile Firms at a very fast pace. On the other hand, {{it has been argued that}} Eco-Friendly Textiles and its related terms are known at a minimal level among the consumers in European countries. It has also been observed that very little research work is attempted to investigate the perceptions, understanding and willingness of consumers in considering <b>Eco-Friendly</b> Textiles as <b>clothing</b> alternate, through quantitative techniques. Thus, this research gap in literature has motivated the study where researcher has attempted to study the perceptions of consumers about Eco-Friendly apparel as an ethical alternate in European Region, with the help of quantitative research technique i. e. “Questionnaire Survey”. This survey is based on 100 participants; consisted of 26 close ended questions, targeted equally at males and females (50 / 50). This research has demonstrated the fact that Eco-Friendly Textiles has the potential to succeed within various social groups, having different level of awareness, apparel buying preferences and criteria, who are concerned about ethical and socially responsible dimensions of environment. However, while operating in conventional apparel industry, organizations promoting the use of Eco-Friendly alternates require an extra effort to get the attention of customers, who are using conventional textiles since centuries. There is a high possibility of positive influence of these companies over European Consumers (and beyond) and enterprises in the West especially towards the ethical dimensions of Eco-Friendly textiles...|$|R

In an interview with Douglas Fudge of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada who heads the research team looking into the hagfish slime states that when dried out the fibres within the slime become very silk-like, the fibres being very thin and strong. “Hagfish slime is made up of two parts: mucus and tiny fibres, about 15cm long but only a micron wide (National Geographic, 2014).” It could be a natural renewable alternative to non-renewable fabrics like nylon and spandix which are made from oil. They propose that in the future (even though no one has been able to extract the proteins and make a spool of hagfish thread yet), that the proteins will be able to be extracted and made into <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>clothing</b> such as athletic wear or even because of the strength bulletproof vests.|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. Fashion DesignThe need {{to educate}} {{consumers}} about <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>clothing</b> cannot be over emphasized any longer, {{research has shown that}} consumers with environmental knowledge are likely to purchase eco-friendly products and {{would be willing to pay}} a premium price for such products. Cheap clothing rejects the central ethics of sustainability, and they catalyse unnecessary overconsumption behaviour worldwide. With an increase in purchasing power of many consumers, excessive consumption behaviour suggests that cheap fashion merchandise are purchased and disposed of rapidly by several consumer groups. The current fashion retail industry obtains new fashion styles and supplies new clothing ranges within short span of time enticing fervent consumers' with an impetuous buying behaviour, particularly the younger consumers. The majority of consumers do not understand that their buying behaviour and disposal behaviour impacts negatively on the environment. This is a particularly common in South Africa with very few retail shops offering eco-certified clothing merchandise. This study explores consumer awareness on what constitutes eco-fashion and if their knowledge could, in future, influence them towards sustainable buying behaviour. This study also considers educational measures taken by the South African government and non-governmental organisations to empower citizens with respect to environmental issues...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Suzanne Loker, Professor Sheila DankoThe main {{research}} question {{for this study}} was: how can eco-friendly apparel design re-think, or ?re-fashion,? consumer interactions with clothing in order to cause less environmental harm while also meeting or exceeding consumer wants and needs? The objective {{of this research was}} to create collections of eco-friendly apparel designs that would meet the goals for consumer appeal and behavioral influence, and then to exhibit them so that consumers could react to and rate the success of these design collections? concepts and executions in meeting those goals. Experts in <b>eco-friendly</b> <b>clothing</b> design provided feedback about an initial set of design goals derived from the literature review. A finalized list of Eco-Friendly Apparel Design Goals was developed that along with the literature review inspired {{the development of a new}} eco-design framework for this study called the ERRor-Friendly Framework: effective, resilient, and relational. These goals and principles were conceptualized and executed into eco-friendly apparel design collections. Each design concept was inspired by a combination of research-derived information, expert feedback, and personal inspiration. A panel of design critics evaluated the designs in order to solve problems, improve designs, and select the most viable ideas. In the end, a total of five eco-friendly apparel collections were created: two effective designs, one resilient design, and two relational designs. The Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) Label and T-shirts effective design provides consumers with environmental impact data on products so they can make informed choices and behaviors. The Green Clothing Care (GCC) Label and T-Shirts effective design encourages low-impact clothing care behaviors. The ?Suit Yourself? resilient design transforms over time to reflect current fashion trends and the wearer?s changing sizes so that consumers are more satisfied with their clothes and consume fewer clothes overall. The ?No Sew? Projects relational design provides easy, do-it-yourself projects that allow people with no sewing skills to be creative and make worthwhile products. ?The Dowry Dress? relational design re-thinks the life cycle of a wedding dress so that it becomes part of the entire life of the marriage. The five design collections were evaluated during a two-week exhibit at an art gallery in downtown Ithaca, NY. During the exhibit?s duration, 52 people participated in the study by completing a short questionnaire assessing each design collection?s appeal, behavioral influence, and interest in design features. General consumer attitude and behavior responses were used to identify them as either green or conventional consumers. The questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to provide a summary of results and chi square tests for significant relationships between participants? consumer types and how they responded to the designs. The results showed that all of the designs possessed positive overall design appeal and the ability to influence behavioral change. Furthermore, analysis of consumer type with design assessment results showed no significant differences between how green and conventional consumers responded, except LCA Label influence. Based on the questionnaire results for the design assessment and the green and conventional consumer analysis, each of the five design collections met the study?s two overall goals for appealing to all consumers, both green and conventional, and influencing them to change their behaviors. This high appeal and influence indicates that each design has potential for certain commercial applications, which will have the potential to reduce environmental impact. However, this study only tested behavioral intentions rather than actual behaviors. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether these designs would in fact inspire the intended behavioral changes in consumers and that those behaviors would indeed produce a net reduction in environmental impact.
