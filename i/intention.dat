40|$|Two studies tested whether action {{control by}} {{implementation}} <b>intentions</b> {{is sensitive to}} the activation and strength of participants’ underlying goal <b>intentions.</b> In Study 1, participants formed implementation <b>intentions</b> (or did not) and their goal <b>intentions</b> were measured. Findings revealed a significant interaction between implementation <b>intentions</b> {{and the strength of}} respective goal <b>intentions.</b> Implementation <b>intentions</b> benefited the rate of goal attainment when participants had strong goal <b>intentions</b> but not when goal <b>intentions</b> were weak. Study 2 activated either a task-relevant or a neutral goal outside of participants’ conscious awareness and found that implementation <b>intentions</b> affected performance only when the relevant goal had been activated. These findings indicate that the rate of goal attainment engendered by implementation <b>intentions</b> takes account of the state (strength, activation) of people’s superordinate goal <b>intentions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the utility of volitional and forced <b>intentions</b> in predicting participation in physical activities and effort within the theory of planned behaviour. Four hundred and forty-four participants (184 males, 260 females) aged 19. 1 ± 3. 3 years (mean ± s) completed self-report measures of <b>intentions,</b> attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, volitional <b>intentions,</b> forced <b>intentions,</b> and past behaviour in a physical activity context. Six weeks later, they completed self-report measures of physical activity behaviour and effort. Results indicated that volitional <b>intentions</b> and forced <b>intentions</b> contributed {{to the prediction of}} effort over and above <b>intentions,</b> attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of control, past behaviour, and the product terms of attitudes × <b>intentions</b> and subjective norms × <b>intentions.</b> Volitional <b>intentions</b> and forced <b>intentions</b> did not predict participation in physical activities over and above effort. We concluded that volitional <b>intentions</b> and forced <b>intentions</b> assist in the explanation of effort in the context of physical activity behaviour. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This paper explores whether people hide their unfair <b>intentions</b> from others and how hiding <b>intentions</b> is itself perceived in fairness terms. Our experimental data show a high frequency of cover-up attempts and that affected parties punish the concealment of <b>intentions,</b> establishing that people consider not only unkind <b>intentions</b> but also hiding <b>intentions</b> unfair. When choosing {{whether or not}} to hide <b>intentions,</b> subjects trade-off the lower expected punishment when the cover up of unfair <b>intentions</b> is successful against the higher expected punishment when cover up is unsuccessful. In an attempt to better understand fairness perceptions, we present a typology of punisher types and show that hiding unkind <b>intentions</b> is treated differently than unkind <b>intentions,</b> possibly establishing a behavioral category of its own...|$|R

Results: Goal <b>intentions</b> and implementation <b>intentions</b> predicted exercise during rehabilitation. In contrast, goal <b>intentions</b> failed to predict exercise at later points in time, whereas implementation <b>intentions</b> continued to be associated with exercise 12 months later. Conclusions: Implementation <b>intentions</b> rather than goal <b>intentions</b> predict behavior as it becomes routine. As automatic processes such as behavior elicited by planning are largely age invariant, strengthening those processes might help to overcome volitional problems across all age groups represented in rehabilitation settings...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{implementation}} <b>intentions</b> originated from research on goal striving throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. Developing research suggested that [...] "the correlations between <b>intentions</b> and behavior are modest, in that <b>intentions</b> {{account for only}} 20% to 30% {{of the variance in}} behavior." [...] Strong <b>intentions</b> ("I strongly intend to do X") were observed to be more often realized than weak <b>intentions.</b> Past behavior still tended to be a better predictor for a person's future behavior when it was compared to goal <b>intentions.</b> The research also suggested that the weak intention-behavior relation is a result of people having good <b>intentions,</b> but failing to act on them.|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the implications of}} Peter Gollwitzer's concept of implementation <b>intentions</b> for Icek Ajzen's theory of planned behavior. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and <b>intentions</b> were assessed before an intervention that required subjects to make implementation <b>intentions</b> concerning when and where they would perform breast self-examination during the next month. Behavior was assessed by self-report 1 month later. Results supported Gollwitzer's contention that goal <b>intentions</b> that have been supplemented by implementation <b>intentions</b> concerning where and when the behavior is to be performed {{are more likely to}} be enacted. Evidence suggested that implementation <b>intentions</b> were effective because they provided a mechanism that facilitated the retrieval of <b>intentions</b> in memory. Implementation <b>intentions</b> also reduced the capacity of past behavior to predict future behavior, suggesting that implementation <b>intentions</b> mimic the effect of habit in human action. Implications for applications of models of attitude-behavior relations are outlined...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{showed the}} effectiveness of implementation <b>intentions</b> on goal attainment using controlled settings. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate to what extent people are able to form implementation <b>intentions</b> which benefit goal attainment in an uncontrolled environment. For this purpose, a questionnaire was placed on a website which informed men who have sex with men (MSM) about the possibility of a free hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. Participants of the questionnaire who wanted to make an appointment for a HBV vaccination at a later time or were contemplating making an appointment, were either asked to form implementation <b>intentions</b> or were routed to the control condition. Results show that individuals who formed implementation <b>intentions</b> were more successful in obtaining their goal of making an appointment. <b>Intentions</b> were also a significant predictor of behavioural enactment. The combined effect of strong goal <b>intentions</b> and implementation <b>intentions</b> provided the highest likelihood of goal attainment. Only 33 % of the participants were able to form implementation <b>intentions</b> which could be identified as being good. These individuals were more successful in attaining their goals than people who formed poor implementation <b>intentions</b> and participants in the control condition. Forming poor implementation <b>intentions</b> and the control condition did not differ significantly in the probability of successful goal striving. Hence, forming good implementation <b>intentions</b> is important to increases the likelihood of goal attainment. The strength of the goal <b>intentions</b> proved to be a predictor of the quality of the formed implementation <b>intentions...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{can then}} apply the Law of Modularity to our {{intentional}} hierarchy because {{in order to}} construct <b>intentions,</b> they must first be isomorphic because they influence each other in some way, no matter how trivial. For instance, we already know {{that the development of}} higher-level <b>intentions</b> gives rise to low- and middle-level <b>intentions,</b> and that high-level <b>intentions</b> can only be expressed through some combination of these. Interactions between any of these types of <b>intentions</b> are necessarily isomorphic, similar to those between high-level <b>intentions,</b> because they all exist within the same set of physical parameters. As a result, some interaction between subsets of <b>intentions</b> and actor systems will lead to unexpected results at lower levels. Representing <b>intentions</b> as lattice elements allows {{a better understanding of the}} intentional environment’s inherent structure, as well as a better understanding of the interactions among them.|$|R
