40|$|ArticleFor a long time, the {{jurisprudence}} {{emanating from}} Kenyan courts has treated African customary law as an inferior {{source of law}} in comparison to formal laws. Consequently, certain customary practices and traditions that can foster social justice and peaceful coexistence amongst communities such as traditional <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> had not been formally recognized in law. However, the 2010 Constitution recognizes customary law {{and the use of}} traditional dispute resolution mechanisms in resolving disputes. It also protects the culture and other cultural expressions of the people. This recognition is important because of the close interlink between traditional <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> and customary law. In this paper, an examination of previous court decisions dealing with customary law is attempted to glean courts approach to customary law in the past and whether it can influence the application of traditional <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> in enhancing access to justice. The paper posits that the way courts have interpreted customary law since the advent of colonialism may be a barrier to the application of traditional <b>justice</b> <b>systems.</b> A need therefore arises for courts to develop a jurisprudence that is supportive of customary law and traditional <b>justice</b> <b>systems.</b> A change of mindset and perceptions amongst judges, lawyers and the wider citizenry towards customary law is required if traditional <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> are to contribute to enhanced access to justice for communities in Kenya.

40|$|In {{the general}} population, ethnic {{minorities}} experience {{a range of}} health care disparities. These include a lack of health insurance, {{lack of access to}} health care, lack of knowledge about existing health services, mis/under-diagnoses, and poorly developed cultural sensitivity or discrimination among health care providers. The <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> are disproportionately comprised of ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans and Hispanics.

Given these considerations, this study aims to investigate the extent that ethnic minorities with histories in the <b>justice</b> <b>systems</b> report health care disparities.

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored.
