40|$|Abstract—The pace of {{research}} and development efforts to integrate renewable power sources into modern electric utilities continues to increase. These efforts are motivated by a desire for cleaner, cheaper and more diverse sources of energy. As new analyses and controls approaches are developed to manage renewable sources and tie them into the grid, the need for these controls to be tested in hardware becomes paramount. In particular, <b>hydrokinetic</b> <b>power</b> is appealing due to its high energy density and superior forecastability; however, its development has lagged behind that of wind and solar {{due in part to the}} difficulty of acquiring hardware results on an integrated system. Thus, as an alternative to constructing an elaborate wave-tank or locating a power lab riverside, this paper presents a method based on electromechanical emulation of the energy source using a commercially available induction motor drive.

40|$|Abstract. While {{our planet}} is rapidly {{approaching}} an environmental crisis under the dominant use of depleting fossil fuels, {{the need for}} exploiting all forms of new, small carbon foot-print, renewable, and clean energy resources are increasing in the same proportion. Therefore, the need for exploring all types of clean energy resources that the world has- some of which might have not attracted sufficient attention before- is essential in order to implement sufficient, efficient, and widely use all them. In this respect, operational effectiveness {{of the wind and}} hydrokinetic turbines depend on the performance of the airfoils chosen. Using double-blade airfoils in the wind and hydrokinetic turbines, minimum wind and hydrokinetic flow velocities to produce meaningful and practical mechanical power reduces to 3 - 4 m /s for wind turbines and 1 - 1. 5 m/s or less for hydrokinetic turbines.

Therefore, an optimum geometry of the rotor must be designed and constructed to capture the maximum water energy and convert it into a usable energy. The steps involved in the design and numerical simulation of a small horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbine rotor are presented based on the same incompressible flow techniques used for designing wind turbines. Three blades of a 1 Hp (746 W) prototype hydrokinetic turbine were designed for a water velocity of 1. 5 m/s with a tip speed ratio of 6. 325, an angle of attack of 5 ◦ and 0 ◦ as the pitch angle; in order to obtain the maximum power coefficient of the turbine. This coefficient was 0. 4382, near the Betz limit. S 822 airfoil was used to generate the coordinates of the blade.

Along with a literature study, the HOMER simulation program was used as a technical design tool, and the I 3 A framework proposed by Retnanestri (2007) was adopted as a general design tool to enhance the sustainability of rural electrification programs (REPs) in Riau. Two options have been recommended to meet the future electrical load in a typical Riau rural village. The first option is a hybrid power system comprised of a photovoltaic array, Darrieus hydrokinetic turbines (DHTs), a back-up diesel generator, a battery bank, and an inverter. The second option consists of a diesel generator with biodiesel fuel. The first option met 100 % of the load but the second option had around 20 % capacity shortage. In the first option, the DHTs contributed 55 % of the power output, indicating the viability of exploiting the river power in Riau. The first option had low O&M costs but its capital cost was high, while the second option had the opposite cost structure.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of a micro-scale tidal <b>hydrokinetic</b> generator to <b>power</b> autonomous oceanographic instrumentation, with emphasis on turbine design and performance. This type of "micropower" system is intended to provide continuous power {{on the order of}} 20 Watts. System components are reviewed and include turbine, electrical generator, gearbox, controller, converter, and battery bank. A steady-state model predicts system energy storage and power output in a mixed, mainly semidiurnal tidal regime with peak currents of 1. 5 m/s. Among several turbine designs reviewed, a helical cross-flow turbine is selected, due to its self-start capability, ability to accept inflow from any direction, and power performance. Parameters impacting helical turbine design include radius, blade profile and pitch, aspect ratio, helical pitch, number of blades, solidity ratio, blade wrap ratio, strut design, and shaft diameter. The performance trade-offs of each are compared. A set of three prototype-scale turbines (two three-bladed designs, with 15 % and 30 % solidity, and a four-bladed design with 30 % solidity and higher helical pitch) and several strut and shaft configurations were fabricated and tested in a water flume capable of flow rates up to 0. 8 m/s. Tests included performance characterization of the rotating turbines from freewheel to stall, static torque characterization as a function of azimuthal angle, performance degradation associated with inclination angles up to 10 ° from vertical, and stream-wise wake velocity profiles. A four-bladed turbine with 60 ° helical pitch, 30 % solidity, and circular plate "end cap" provided the best performance; this design attained efficiency of 24 % in 0. 8 m/s flow and experienced smaller performance reductions for tilted orientations relative to other variants. Maximum turbine efficiency increased with increased flume velocity. A free-vortex model was modified to simulate the helical turbine performance. Model results were compared to experimental data for various strut design and inflow velocities, and performance was extrapolated to higher flume velocities and a full-scale turbine (0. 7 m 2 relative to 0. 04 m 2 in flume tests).

40|$|<b>Hydrokinetic</b> tidal <b>power</b> is a {{novel and}} {{emergent}} technology undergoing continuous advancement {{with much of the}} progress focused on large utility scale projects. This resource is potentially underutilized because much of the coastal United States, despite having substantial tidal currents, do not have the deep and wide environments required by most of the developing turbine technology. This dissertation includes a detailed characterization of the tidal hydrodynamics for Rose Dhu Island, Georgia used for a tidal energy resource assessment as well as a general feasibility study for tidal estuaries with extensive wetlands. For predictions and evaluation of the estuarine hydrodynamics, data from an existing numerical model of the estuary encompassing the island is utilized. Field measurements in close proximity to the island are used to calibrate the model as well as characterize local hydrodynamic features. After the model calibration, the simulation data is used to evaluate the hydrodynamics. Wetland dominated estuaries commonly have a high degree of non-linear distortion which govern the relative durations and strengths of the tidal stages and thus the overall hydrodynamics and incoming hydrokinetic energy. The Ogeechee Estuary is characterized as ebb dominant with peak ebb and flood volume fluxes near high tide {{as a result of the}} increased storage capacity of the wetlands. Lowering the average wetland elevation in the model decreased ebb dominance and quickened the transition from flood to ebb tide. Increased domain friction in the model removed energy from the system and reduced ebb dominance. Enhanced model marsh friction reduced lateral flooding of the wetlands as well as ebb dominance. Localized measurements surrounding the island are analyzed to determine a location near the southwest coast of the island as a hydrokinetic energy hotspot. A kinematic and dynamic analysis is performed using channel transect measurements to identify key physical processes behind the hotspot formation. The hotspot forms due to sub-critical flow acceleration over a singular bump in the topography. High streamwise momentum is further concentrated at the hotspot due to secondary circulation cells across the channel. Flood tide circulation is characterized by two co-rotating cells induced by channel curvature and delineated by the bump. Ebb circulation consists of two counter-rotating cells from flow confluence of two upstream channels. Once the hydrodynamics are understood, the theoretical and technical resource assessment of the island is completed. A sensitivity analysis of hydrokinetic energy and tidal distortion is performed on synthetic data. For a principle constituent and its first harmonic, distortion greatly changes as does the distribution of velocities and energy as the relative phase varies. While the theoretical energy remains consistent, the technical energy can greatly vary. This effect is reduced with the addition semi-lunar variation. Using a simplified analytical method, the maximum average channel power is estimated as 8. 80 MW. For the hotspot it is estimated that there is 30. 3 MWh available to capture yearly with an average power of 3. 46 kW for a turbine with an area of 10 square meters. For the same turbine area with conservative efficiencies, the hotspot could provide a yearly technical energy of 10. 9 MWh with an average power of 1. 25 kW for the island. Due to the complex localized hydrodynamics, both the theoretical and technical resource varies greatly across and along the channel. These considerations are more pertinent when performing a hydrokinetic energy resource assessment in a marsh estuary than for large scale bay-ocean exchange environments, the present industry focus.

The United Kingdom has the edge over the rest of countries in this type of renewable energy and leads the innovation race in order to keep the UK economy competitive in future years. Following these reasons, several types of marine turbines are currently being developed and tested. Nevertheless, one of the key issues, in the future development of marine <b>hydrokinetic</b> <b>power</b> generation systems, is to properly understand their prospective performance, not only for each power generation device alone but also for an array of devices as a whole. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that a dense cross-stream array of turbines (so-called turbine fence) is a promising way to extract power from marine currents; however, its optimal intraturbine spacing depends on several physical factors, some of which are still uncertain. One of those uncertain factors is the effect of seabed friction causing vertical shear of the flow, which is difficult to study theoretically and requires 3 -D CFD simulations. Also, little is known about the performance of multiple rows of marine turbines. Consequently, throughout this thesis, numerous arrangements of marine turbines (modelled as actuator disks) have been tested using ANSYS Fluent®, with the idea of assessing the effects of various parameters such as: intra-device spacing, number of rows and turbine resistance coefficient. These CFD simulations have been compared with existing theoretical models (two-scale actuator disk models) for the power extracted by the turbines with the aim of validating these theoretical models.

This application increases renewable energy capacity and decreases energy dependency on foreign resources. In this study, theoretical and numerical approaches are used to model HAHT in open channel flows. Theoretical method uses one-dimensional control volume analysis to predict maximum power that an ideal rotor can extract from the flow as useful power and wake mixing at a given Froude number and blockage ratio. This method is then compared to three-dimensional Actuator Disc Model (ADM) developed in commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code ANSYS Fluent. This model uses a porous media to represent HAHT and Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations along with Volume of Fluid (VoF) model to solve for flow field and track the free surface. Same computation method is implemented with a more advanced model, Virtual Blade Model (VBM), which uses blade element theory to consider geometry of the blade and operating conditions such as angular velocity and pitching angle. This method is used to optimize the turbine geometry for maximum power and find operating limits to avoid cavitation.

According to the US Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2011, the United States possesses 2. 5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of potential natural gas resources. Natural gas from shale resources, considered uneconomical {{just a few years}} ago, accounts for 862 Tcf of this resource estimate, more than double the estimate EIA published last year. At the 2010 rate of U. S. consumption (about 24. 1 Bcf per year), 2. 5 Tcf of natural gas is enough to supply over 100 years of use. Is natural gas the silver bullet for meeting future US and regional energy demand for electricity and vehicle fuels? What is the impact of the increasing supply of natural gas prices on other energy resources, e. g., coal, nuclear, solar and wind? Does it stand to reason that US natural gas production should be used solely for domestic purposes? These and other questions will be considered at the September 28 th Georgia Tech Clean Energy Speakers Series...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In coastal environments, when {{topographic}} and bathymetric constrictions {{are combined}} with large tidal amplitudes, strong currents (> 2 m/s) can occur. Because such environments are relatively rare {{and difficult to}} study, until recently, they have received little attention from the scientific community. However, in recent years, interest in developing tidal <b>hydrokinetic</b> <b>power</b> projects in these environments has motivated studies to improve this understanding. In order to support {{an analysis of the}} acoustic effects of tidal power generation, a multi-year study was conducted at a proposed project site in Puget Sound (WA) are analyzed at a site where peak currents exceeded 3. 5 m/s. From these analyses, three noise sources are shown to dominate the observed variability in ambient noise between 0. 02 - 30 kHz: anthropogenic noise from vessel traffic, sediment-generated noise during periods of strong currents, and flow-noise resulting from turbulence advected over the hydrophones. To assess the contribution of vessel traffic noise, one calendar year of Automatic Identification System (AIS) ship-traffic data was paired with hydrophone recordings. The study region included inland waters of the Salish Sea within a 20 km radius of the hydrophone deployment site in northern Admiralty Inlet. The variability in spectra and hourly, daily, and monthly ambient noise statistics for unweighted broadband and M-weighted sound pressure levels is driven largely by vessel traffic. Within the one-year study period, at least one AIS transmitting vessel is present in the study area 90 % of the time and over 1, 363 unique vessels are recorded. A noise budget for vessels equipped with AIS transponders identifies cargo ships, tugs, and passenger vessels as the largest contributors to noise levels. A simple model to predict received levels at the site based on an incoherent summation of noise from different vessel types yields a cumulative probability density function of broadband sound pressure levels that shows good agreement with 85 % of the temporal data. Bed stresses associated with currents can produce propagating ambient noise by mobilizing sediments. The strength of the tidal currents in northern Admiralty Inlet produces bed stresses in excess of 20 Pa. Significant increases in noise levels at frequencies from 4 - 30 kHz, with more modest increases noted from 1 - 4 kHz, are attributed to mobilized sediments. Sediment-generated noise during strong currents masks background noise from other sources, including vessel traffic. Inversions of the acoustic spectra for equivalent grain sizes are consistent with qualitative observations of the seabed composition. Bed stress calculations using log layer, Reynolds stress, and inertial dissipation techniques generally agree well and are used to estimate the shear stresses at which noise levels increase for different grain sizes. Ambient noise levels in one-third octave bands with center frequencies from 1 kHz to 25 kHz are dominated by sediment-generated noise and can be accurately predicted using the near-bed current velocity above a critical threshold. When turbulence is advected over a pressure sensitive transducer, the turbulent pressure fluctuations can be measured as noise, though these pressure fluctuations are not propagating sound and should not be interpreted as ambient noise. Based on measurements in both Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound and the Chacao Channel, Chile, two models are developed for flow-noise. The first model combined measurements of mean current velocities and turbulence and agrees well with data from both sites. The second model uses scaling arguments to model the flow-noise based solely on the mean current velocity. This model agrees well with the data from the Chacao Channel but performs poorly in Admiralty Inlet, a difference attributed to differences turbulence production mechanisms. At both sites, the spectral slope of flow noise follows a f - 3. 2 dependence, suggesting partial cancellation of the pressure fluctuations when the turbulent scales are on order of, or smaller than, the characteristic size of the hydrophone. At both sites, flow-noise levels can exceed ambient noise levels during slack currents by more than 50 dB at 20 Hz and flow-noise is measured at frequencies greater than 500 Hz. In Admiralty Inlet, the use of a compact flow shield is shown to reduce flow-noise levels by up to 30 dB. Below 1 kHz, the dominant source of ambient noise is vessel traffic, though during periods of strong currents, the propagating noise from vessels can be difficult to identify because of flow-noise. At frequencies above 1 kHz, during periods of strong currents, the dominant source of ambient noise is bedload transport. Observation of this higher frequency sound is not affected by flow-noise, which is limited to lower frequencies in northern Admiralty Inlet. These results are combined with marine species hearing thresholds, a turbine source spectrum, and a simple propagation model to roughly quantify the probability of marine animals detecting the sound of operating turbines against ambient noise. The results suggest that the likely detection range of operating turbines is limited to less than 1 km under most conditions. The sound produced by operating tidal turbines at the proposed demonstration-scale tidal power project is not likely to have any significant behavioral effect at greater range. Finally, the ambient statistics at the site are also combined with a sound propagation model and vocalization characteristics of Southern Resident killer whales to determine the effective range for passive acoustic monitoring techniques at the proposed project location. Due to the frequency overlap between sediment-generated noise and killer whale vocalizations, during peak currents the detection range for vocalizations is reduced by up to 90 % when compared to slack current noise levels. Although the reduction in detection range is significant, this analysis suggests that passive acoustic monitoring will still be effective at ranges greater than the typical range at which killer whales can detect the turbines. These results of these two detection studies will inform the design of post-installation monitoring plans to quantify noise production by operating turbines and the associated environmental changes. This dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of ambient noise measurements in an energetic coastal environment and advances the understanding of noise sources unique to these environments, such as sediment-generated noise and flow-noise. The improved understanding of these noise sources will aid in the interpretation of acoustic measurements in other energetic environments. Furthermore, as uncertainties in sound produced by tidal turbines and marine animal behavioral responses to this sound are reduced, the foundation laid by this research will allow the acoustic impacts of tidal <b>hydrokinetic</b> <b>power</b> projects to be quantified...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} facing an {{imminent}} energy supply crisis. Our well-being {{is linked to}} the energy supply, and energy is in high demand in both the developed and the developing world. In order to sustain our energy supply, it is necessary to advance renewable technologies. Despite this urgency, however, it is paramount to consider the larger environmental effects associated with using renewable resources. Hydropower, in the past, has been seen as a viable resource to examine, given that its basics of mechanical to electrical energy conversion seem to have little effect on the environment. Discrete analysis of dams and in-stream diversion set-ups has shown otherwise, though. Modifications to river flows and changes in temperature (from increased and decreased flows) cause adverse effects to fish and other marine life because of changes in their adaptive habitat. Recent research has focused on kinetic energy extraction in river flows, which may prove to be more sustainable, as this type of extraction does not involve a large reservoir or large flow modification. The field of hydrokinetic energy extraction is immature; {{little is known about the}} devices' performance in the river environment, and their risk of impingement, fouling, and suspension of sediments. Governing principles of hydrokinetic energy extraction are presented, along with a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system. Power extraction methods are compared, and verification and validation of the CFD model through mesh sensitivity and experimental data are presented. A 0. 0506 average mesh skew and 0. 2 m/s velocity convergence was obtained within the mesh sensitivity analysis. In comparing particle image velocimetry (PIV) data with the CFD model, a 0. 0155 m offset and 20 % error were present. However, including a volume of fluid (VOF) model within the CFD model produced a 5 % error improvement and gave a 0. 0124 m offset. These are improvements over the current state of the art, where visual comparisons are common. Three-dimensional CFD models of a submerged water wheel, Savonius turbine, squirrel cage Darrieus turbine, and Gorlov Darrieus turbine are also presented; however, they are non-VOF CFD models. Using the results of the CFD models, preliminary predictions could be made of the environmental impact of hydrokinetic turbines with respect to fish swimming patterns. Additionally, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for hydrokinetic energy extraction (HEE), which gives insight into the total system environmental impact. HEE has been seen as a potentially "benign' form of renewable hydropower. This work provides a benchmark for initial measurement of HEE environmental impacts, since negative outcomes have been present with previously-assumed benign renewable hydropower. A Gorlov system was used to represent a HEE system. LCA was utilized to compare the environmental impacts of HEE with small hydropotential (HPP) power, coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) criteria air emissions were quantified and compared over the life cycle of the systems. Life cycle air emissions were used in combination with the TRACI impact assessment tool to compare the systems. The Gorlov system was found to have the lowest life cycle impact with a system lifetime comparison, and compared closely with small HPP. Finally, various issues connected to the implementation of <b>hydrokinetic</b> <b>power</b> generation were discussed. Policy development and sediment movement were investigated in more detail. Additionally, two applications of this technology were explored: in-situ river health monitoring and remote energy generation...|$|E
