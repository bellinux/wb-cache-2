5|$|The {{economic}} growth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> {{the expansion of}} services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country {{may be able to}} skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A {{rapid increase in}} the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of such tools <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> {{the large amount}} of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of overseas activities by China's energy companies <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the needs of both government and the PRC's National Oil Companies (NOC), which have worked in an uncommonly close partnership to increase overseas production of oil and gas. Together, they gained access to projects of strategic importance in African nations like Sudan and Nigeria in the 1990s, while leaving smaller opportunities to the companies alone.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the annual}} growth in {{national}} health spending is not mainly due to increasing demand from ageing populations, but rather <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> rising incomes, costly new medical technology, {{a shortage of}} health care workers and informational asymmetries between providers and patients. A number of health problems become more prevalent as people get older. These include mental health problems {{as well as physical}} health problems, especially dementia.|$|E

25|$|So far, the Tedpix index <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> {{domestic}} investors, including wealthy Iranians, {{public sector}} {{pension funds and}} the investment arms of state-owned banks. For the index to prosper in the long run, more foreign investors need to make significant share purchases. As at 2009, foreign portfolio investment accounts for only about 2 percent {{of the stock market}} in Iran. Foreign investors find it difficult to invest directly or indirectly, since banks cannot transfer funds, and there are no custodian banks because of sanctions.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomics {{has been}} characterised by the {{development}} of new techniques which have redefined what is possible every decade or so and render previous technologies obsolete. The first attempt at capturing a partial human transcriptome was published in 1991 and reported 609 mRNA sequences from the human brain. In 2008, two human transcriptomes, composed of millions of transcript-derived sequences covering 16,000 genes, were published and, by 2015, transcriptomes had been published for hundreds of individuals. Transcriptomes of different disease states, tissues or even single cells are now routinely generated. This explosion in transcriptomics <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the rapid development of new technologies with improved sensitivity and economy.|$|E
25|$|Action {{initiated}} by Spence {{to improve the}} financial sustainability of the university has alienated some students and staff. In 2012, Spence led efforts to cut the university's expenditure to address the financial impact of a slowdown in international student enrolments across Australia. This included redundancies {{of a number of}} university staff and faculty, though some at the university argued that the institution should cut back on building programs instead. Critics argue the push for savings <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> managerial incompetence and indifference, fuelling industrial action during a round of enterprise bargaining in 2013 that also reflected widespread concerns about public funding for higher education.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} be able to survive in both fresh and salt water also gives another benefit that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring in the fresh water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the behavior that is observed from the Bull sharks as to why there would be any reason for the adult bull shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E
25|$|This {{change is}} due to the influx into Tallahassee of many {{students}} and workers {{from other parts of the}} state, and from outside the state and outside the South. Primarily this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the birth and great expansion of Florida State University, founded in 1947, to some extent to serve World War II veterans studying under the G.I. Bill. Its predecessor, Florida State College for Women, was politically liberal and pro-integration, but it was small and its faculty and graduates had little political power. Secondarily, Tallahassee's change has been due to Florida A University, and to the changing demographics of the state itself. Florida's population growth has been due to in-migration from other, usually more liberal parts of the country. As the state became more liberal, so did the legislators and their staffs.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, non-Hispanic whites {{represented}} 80% of Miami-Dade county's population. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Miami's {{population as}} 45.3% Hispanic, 32.9% non-Hispanic White, and 22.7% Black. Miami's explosive population growth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> internal migration {{from other parts}} of the country, primarily up until the 1980s, as well as by immigration, primarily from the 1960s to the 1990s. Today, immigration to Miami has slowed significantly and Miami's growth today is attributed greatly to its fast urbanization and high-rise construction, which has increased its inner city neighborhood population densities, such as in Downtown, Brickell, and Edgewater, where one area in Downtown alone saw a 2,069% increase in population in the 2010 Census. Miami is regarded as more of a multicultural mosaic, than it is a melting pot, with residents still maintaining much of, or some of their cultural traits. The overall culture of Miami is heavily influenced by its large population of Hispanics and blacks mainly from the Caribbean islands.|$|E
