25|$|On 15 March 2005, the Skylink Chairlift, which {{provided}} {{a link between}} Gold Rush Country and the Australian Wildlife Experience, closed. It remained standing for several months before the wires were removed. The support poles remain standing to this day.

25|$|Since then Dreamworld has {{constantly}} evolved {{adding new}} rides, themed lands and characters. One year after opening in 1982, the Thunderbolt opened as the world's longest steel double loop roller coaster. A new themed {{area known as}} <b>Gum</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully also opened. In 1983, Blue Lagoon water park opened and Dreamworld introduced Belinda Brown as the park's third mascot. In 1984 the park began seven-day trading {{after two years of}} only being open Thursday through to Tuesday. In 1986, Gold Rush Country (now the Town of Gold Rush) opened featuring Eureka Mountain Mine Ride and Thunder River Rapids Ride. In 1987, Koala Country opened and in 1989 the Skylink Chairlift opened.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hopes}} that one day the school would reopen, plans were made for its {{maintenance}} in the interim. Some equipment was sold off to Peterhouse and to Ruzawi but {{a great deal of}} the furniture and fittings, musical instruments, sporting equipment, blankets and linen were put into storage in Junior House. Patrick Gosho moved into the housemaster's flat in Junior House to caretake what remained of the school, which was not confined simply to the school buildings. There was also the large estate to be managed, with its <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> plantations (which were still economically viable) and St Francis village, the home of the Springvale Estate workers and their families, which had grown up along with the school since the 1950s and had a chapel and a school of its own.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, {{expanded}} again {{adding another}} two new themed areas. The {{first was the}} Blue Lagoon water park. Attractions at Blue Lagoon included a body slide named Aqualoop Flume Ride, a tube ride named Krakatoa's Revenge, and a toboggan ride named Toboggan Ride. A large lagoon swimming pool and a children's pool rounded out the water park. The second themed area was Village Green which was constructed to provide {{a link between the}} 1982 additions of Country Fair and <b>Gum</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully. Attractions at Village Green included a matterhorn ride named Avalanche, a set of Bertazzon bumper cars, a carousel, an arcade and a miniature train ride named Little Puff which ventured through an area known as The Enchanted Forest. Country Fair was also expanded with the addition of the Enterprise (later Reef Diver) and a Chance Rides Trabant named Roulette (later Stingray). The park also introduced its third mascot, Belinda Brown.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 2002, the {{entrance}} to the Tower of Terror was relocated to {{the opposite side of the}} track. This was followed by the closure of the Central Cafe, Kennyland and part of Village Oval. Shortly after, a temporary children's area opened in <b>Gum</b> <b>Tree</b> Gully. Known as the Kid's Carnival, the area featured several of the rides from Kennyland including the Dream Copters, Kenny Karts and Adventure Trails. A children's ferris wheel was also included in the lineup. In August 2002, it was announced that Dreamworld would be adding Nickelodeon Central, however, specific details at the time were sparse. After investing $7 million Dreamworld officially opened Nickelodeon Central on 26 December 2002. New attractions included Rugrats Runaway Reptar roller coaster, Wild Thornberry's Rainforest Rampage and the Slime Bowl. The Zumer from the Country Fair themed area was relocated to Nickelodeon Central and rethemed to Swinger Zinger. Kennyland's Dream Copters ride was relocated and resumed operation under the same name and theme. The existing Carousel, Bumper Bowl and Avalanche were renamed to Nick-O-Round, Rocket Power Bumper Beach and Angry Beavers Spooty Spin, respectively.|$|E
500|$|On 4 June 1915, Corkhill {{enrolled}} as a {{staff nurse}} in the Australian Imperial Force. She left Fremantle aboard the A62 Wandila on 25 June 1915, and arrived in Egypt in July that year. She {{was assigned to the}} 1st Australian General Hospital, and assisted in the treatment of soldiers involved with the Gallipoli Campaign. On 24 March 1916, Corkhill was among a group of nurses sent to Marseille aboard the Braemar Castle, a hospital ship. Arriving in early April, she was then sent aboard a train destined for the 2nd British General Hospital in Le Havre. The train was poorly equipped and was missing many amenities, such as toilets or water, so the women were forced to improvise by washing with cologne. In her time at the British hospital, Corkhill looked forward to returning to an Australian hospital and being [...] "amongst our boys"; the Australian soldiers often found their compatriots to be friendlier than the British nurses. On Anzac Day 1916, a year after the landing at Gallipoli, Corkhill and two other Australian nurses commemorated the occasion. They wore <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> leaves on their capes, and gave small packets of cigarettes and matches to the Australians who were interned at the hospital as gifts.|$|E

[...] Mungara is a restored on-site hand-made brick whitewashed cottage, now fulfilling the functions of meeting room, educational facility, and site museum.

2500|$|Students {{traditionally}} stuck their {{chewing gum}} on a redbud {{tree on the}} east side of campus. This [...] "gum tree" [...] was decorated in colorful wads, and at times, it even sported students' names. [...] Lore has it that the concept of the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> originated in the 1920s when it was against the rules to chew gum in class. The tree was vandalized and knocked down by an unknown party in 2000, but students quickly adopted another tree.|$|E

2500|$|Fire-tolerant {{species are}} able to {{withstand}} a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "resprouters." [...] Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire. For example, after an Australian bushfire, the Mountain Grey <b>Gum</b> <b>tree</b> (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa) starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves {{from the base of the}} tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Dreamworld further {{expanded}} its wildlife offerings by running after hours [...] "". In August 2003, Thunderbolt was closed. It was demolished and sold for scrap metal in March 2004. Dreamworld has retained {{a section of}} track {{and at least one}} train in the park's back-of-house areas. Later that year in September 2004, The Claw opened in Ocean Parade.
