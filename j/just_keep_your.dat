6000|$|There was {{a company}} of Germans, or Dutchmen, as the boys always called them; and the boys {{believed}} that they each had hay in his right shoe, and straw in his left, because a Dutchman was too dumb, as the boys said for stupid, to know his feet apart any other way; and that the Dutch officers had to call out to the men when they were marching, [...] "Up mit de hay-foot, down mit de straw-foot--links, links, links!" [...] (Left, left, left!) But the boys honored even these imperfect intelligences so much in their quality of soldiers that they would any {{of them have been}} proud to be marker in the Dutch company; and they followed the Dutchmen round in their march as fondly as any other body of troops. Of course, school let out when there was a regular muster, and the boys gave the whole day to it; but I do not know just when the Muster Day came. They fired the cannon a good deal on the river-bank, and they must have camped somewhere near the town, though no recollection of tents remained in my boy's mind. He believed {{with the rest of the}} boys that the right way to fire the cannon was to get it so hot you need not touch it off, but <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> thumb on the touch-hole, and take it away when you wanted the cannon to go off. Once he saw the soldiers ram the piece full of dog-fennel on top of the usual charge, and then he expected the cannon to burst. But it only roared away as usual.|$|E

5000|$|The EP's title {{reflects}} frontman Jason Lytle's {{frustration with}} his hometown, Modesto, California, {{and has been}} described as [...] "not so much a farewell as a fuck off to the town". The name comes from something Lytle saw on the vanity license plate of a large truck in Modesto. In Lytle's words, the EP [...] "was a nice opportunity for me to produce some whiney little complaining songs about my hometown. I think it's pretty blatant; it's pretty stripped down in terms of the message." [...] It was recorded simultaneously with the final Grandaddy album, and Lytle planned to leave Modesto as soon as the album was complete, stating [...] "In Modesto, it's like gravity is a lot heavier. There's something that just makes you feel like you're doing all you can <b>just</b> to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> head above water, when in fact there's not a whole lot going on." [...] He recorded the EP as [...] "a way to fill the gaps of time while recording the new album. I just thought I could throw together some old songs and some newer ones and a really new one".|$|R

Dahui taught that [...] This one word ‘no’ is a knife to sunder the doubting mind of birth and death.

5000|$|Constable Kevin Goody (James Dreyfus): Goody {{is perhaps}} the least complex of the show's characters. Unintelligent and {{oblivious}} to the obvious, he has very little idea of what being a police officer entails; he has admitted that [...] "wearing a nice uniform" [...] was one reason he joined the force. Easily confused, his ineptitude amazes Fowler, who once exclaimed, [...] "Your head is <b>just</b> something you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> hat on, isn't it?". Goody is known to keep a chocolate bar (usually a Curly Wurly) in the truncheon pocket of his uniform trousers, and is always on an unsuccessful quest to win the heart of Habib despite his obvious camp behaviour; almost every episode shows him trying to impress her. He lives with his mother, of whom he is terrified ("...she'll come down here, and do her raving Nah-Nah...") and Habib has learned to threaten to inform her when he becomes too annoying. He once struck a prisoner in anger when the young thug made a racist remark to Habib, {{for which he was}} nearly charged by Fowler.|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} few {{negative}} reviews, The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle {{gave the}} episode a [...] "D" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "Let's lay out the huge problem with 'This Ball Of Mud And Meanness' right off the bat: it's an entire episode built around Bruce Wayne hunting down the man who killed his parents, which is a revenge tale that has no end in sight and also contains no real dramatic stakes. The problem with the 'who murdered the Waynes?' story is more than just knowing that Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. With enough good storytelling, we could ignore that fact and just enjoy the process of seeing Bruce get there. But Gotham has no interest in actually digging into the psychology of Bruce Wayne, or how his traumatic experience affected him, or how the corrosion of Gotham, potentially at the hands of his parents, creates the need for villains and heroes. Instead, Gotham continues to coast on the canon. It's like a mirage in a dry desert; the promise is that if you <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> crawling towards <b>your</b> destination, despite evidence suggesting that once you get there you'll be disappointed, everything will be fine." ...|$|R
