In hydraulic systems of machines <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are main component ofsupply unit or perform auxiliary function. <b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> opposite to vane pumps are less complicated. They consists of such components as:housing, gear wheels, bearings, shaft, seal for rotation motion which are not very sensitive for damage {{and that is why}} they are using veryoften. However, <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are break down from time to time. Usually damage of pump cause shutting down of machines and devices. One of the way for identifying potential failures and foreseeing their effects is a quality method. On the basis of these methods apreventing action might be undertaken before failure appear. In this paper potential failures and damages of a <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> were presented bythe usage of matrix FMEA analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to present a proof of concept for alternative methods to power wheelchair lifts. Wheelchair lifts provide access to elevations and vehicles that were previously denied to the wheelchair enabled. Platform type lifts allow users to perform these functions without separating from the wheelchair. The purpose of this project {{is to develop a}} human powered input to provide lift to the platform. The goal is to provide improved accessibility, mobility, and independence to the client. We were able to provide a sufficient test apparatus for developing/testing the lift power delivery system and incorporate a viable method for delivering lift with a human input limited to 10 pounds. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> equipped with a modified handle was used as a power delivery system. Test results were inconclusive, suggesting a review of the power delivery system...|$|R
40|$|For {{experiments}} on mechanical products composed of several components, {{such as a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> conventional methods of designing and implementing factorial experiments can be impractical because of the prohibitive costs of obtaining certain components with factors set to prespecified values. A further difficulty is that often some {{of the factors that}} are believed to influence the product's performance are not features of a single component but are derived as functions of the dimensions of several components arising from the product's assembly. Experiments are proposed which use a sample of measured components to explore the influence of such derived factors. An algorithmic method for obtaining efficient designs is presented and applied to finding plans for studies on the <b>gear</b> <b>pump.</b> An experiment on the pump is described which involved both conventional and derived factors. This experiment led to new knowledge on how to improve the engineering design of the pump and, in particular, on how to improve its robustness to the varying pressures that are experienced in operation...|$|R
50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} to extend the landing gear the gear hydraulic motor operated but the gear did not extend. After several seconds of gear motor operation the circuit breaker for the gear motor popped. Further attempts to extend the gear by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A gear up landing was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and the landing gear was extended by use of the manual <b>gear</b> extension emergency <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> According to maintenance personnel a wire to the nose landing gear squat switch was chafed and grounded which caused the system to be signaled for gear up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend the gear by use of the backup <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> because the <b>gear</b> down solenoid had overheated during attempts to lower the gear and froze in the gear up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing {{they were able to}} manually lower the gear. Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire to the nose landing gear squat switch which resulted in the landing gear being signaled at all times for gear up when electrical power was applied to the system. Contributing to the accident was the overheating of the gear down solenoid which caused it to stick in the gear up position and prevented the gear from being manually extended.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic <b>pump</b> types (<b>gear,</b> vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the <b>pump</b> housing. Some <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps.</b> This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R

Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

A pressure switch will energize the <b>pump</b> if <b>hydraulic</b> pressure falls below a preset level and de-energize the pump when pressure returns to normal. A duty cycle of 3 minutes on and a cooling period of 20 minutes off is required to avoid overheating the pump motor.|$|R

An {{electric}} excavator consumes battery {{energy to}} drive {{an electric motor}} attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> to generate <b>hydraulic</b> power. In a conventional hydraulic excavator, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> is controlled by regulators, which are used to optimize the diesel engine efficiency. Because {{of a lack of}} battery energy capacity, an electric excavator controller should consider not only the electric motor efficiency but also the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency. Thus, electric motor and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency maps were constructed. An optimal operating map (OOM) was created based on the most efficient operating points under each input condition. An integrated control algorithm controlled the speed of the electric motor and displacement of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> according to the OOM. To confirm the utility of this algorithm, a model-in-the-loop simulator for the algorithm with an electric excavator was established. The simulation results showed that the integrated control algorithm improved the energy efficiency of an electric excavator...|$|R

In this article, a novel method based on high-frequency harmonic local characteristic-scale decomposition sub-signal separation and discrete cosine transform high-order singular entropy is proposed. In order to reduce noises and other disturbances, the vibration signal is processed by the local characteristic-scale decomposition modified by the high-frequency harmonic. Sub-signal with sensitive information is obtained by blind source separation of the selected intrinsic scale components. Furthermore, the discrete cosine transform high-order spectral analysis algorithm is proposed to extract singular entropies of Shannon and Tsallis to be the degradation features of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> Analysis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is feasible and effective in indicating the performance degradation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{trochoidal}} <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> {{also known}} as gerotor, owing to its remarkable advantages compared to other <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps</b> is chosen for many engineering applications. As each application is unique, the designer ought to be knowledgeable of the required specifications as a first task but need not be {{an expert in the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> design. The review of the existing research reveals significant gaps to develop a new-born project and the work presented in this paper, drawn on existing research work and the authors’ own experience and know-how, aims to overcome them. The objective of the paper is then to provide a summary of the best practice rules to design a trochoidal <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> from scratch achieving a thorough understanding. In the conceptual stage, making decisions come according to a predetermined set of four parameters known by the designer that will lead to the complete development of the trochoidal gear set. Afterwards, in the design process, the most important characteristics of the pump such as the porting, the pump construction, and the limitations are presented based on the significant explanations, with regard to each feature, selection, effects, and good practices. As a result, the methodology presented compiles the process of engineering in designing a new trochoidal <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> as a catalogue of guidelines aiming to overcome a vague design {{due to a lack of}} knowledge. This collection of best practice rules intends to guide the designer to take good decisions early in the design process that limit design change later in the final stage—the prototype.
