Research of the power block equipment heat state in the presence and absence of external heat insulation of the converted gas-turbine engine case was performed by computational fluid dynamics methods. Based on the maximum permissible gas-turbine engine case temperature under the conditions of fire- and <b>explosion</b> <b>safety,</b> thickness of heat-insulating mats on the different gas-turbine engine case parts was calculated. Simulation results have shown essential decrease of the temperatures of the gasturbine engine case external surface and low-sized power block equipment under low reduction of turbine efficiency and gas-turbine engine power due to additional heat expansion of the case. Advisability of external heat insulation application on the cases of converted gas-turbine engines, working in turbocompressor unit power block enclosures, needs additional feasibility study. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????. ???????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ??????? ? ??? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????????? ?????????. ??????? ????????????????? ?????, ??????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????, ??????????????, ?????? ?? ??????????? ?? ???????????, ??????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ????????????????????????. ?????????? ????????, ??? ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ?????????, ??-?? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????. ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????, ?????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????, ??????? ??????????????? ???????-?????????????? ???????????...|$|R

30|$|Ammonium nitrate (AN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common commercially {{available}} nitrogen fertilizers, the content of nitrogen in which amounts up to 35 % by mass. The main agrochemical advantage of AN compared to other simple nitrogen fertilizers is to present nitrogen both in ammonia and nitrate forms. Herewith, the high content of this component enables to mix it with other types of fertilizers and obtain complex fertilizer with the high content of basic nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The main disadvantages of such types of fertilizers are their high hygroscopicity, caking [1] and the increased requirements for fire and <b>explosion</b> <b>safety</b> [2]. All the above-mentioned factors, and in particular the last, are the main disadvantages limiting the production of complex AN-based fertilizers.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the ways}} {{to improve the quality of}} complex AN-based {{fertilizers}} and reduce the risk of explosion is to increase the ammoniation degree of wet-process phosphoric acid, which reduces the AN portion in the product. Such way can improve the properties of the final product (decrease hygroscopicity and caking), increase its thermal stability, decrease the amount of different compounds in exhaust gases (nitrous gases, chlorine and fluorine compounds) during thermal decomposition, increase fire and <b>explosion</b> <b>safety,</b> and also decrease viscosity of ammonium phosphate–nitrate slurries produced during the production of fertilizer that can decrease energy cost for their transportation. However, information on influence of the degree of phosphoric acid ammoniation on the above-mentioned properties of complex AN-based fertilizers and their intermediates is absent in the literature.|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} façade system {{concept was}} {{developed at the}} University of Michigan by Professor Harry Giles that considered the use of various transparent and composite materials in building construction. Particular aspects of this transparent composite façade system (TCFS) were investigated in this dissertation and involved the use of recyclable polymers and biofiber composites. This dissertation addresses research questions related to structural and environmental performance of the transparent composite façade system (TCFS) compared to a glass curtain wall system (GCWS). In order {{to better understand the}} context for the TCFS and establish performance evaluation methods, an extensive literature review was conducted focusing on material performance, structural performance requirements, life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, composite panel principles, product surveys and building codes. Structural design criteria were established for the TCFS with respect to the strength and stiffness requirements of the International Building Code (IBC). A new testing frame was fabricated and installed at the architectural department of the University of Michigan to conduct static and impact tests in accordance with Safety Performance Specifications and Methods of Test (ANSI Z 97. 1). Initial static tests were carried out to measure bending stiffness of TCFS specimens in order to compare the results with theoretical predictions. Impact tests were also carried out to examine whether TCFS specimens conformed to the <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> criteria specified in ANSI Z 97. 1. In addition, a comparative LCA of a TCFS and a GCWS was performed on each system to assess their respective environmental implications. Structural testing results indicated that the bending stiffness according to simple beam theory is in agreement with measured stiffness under two-edge supported conditions. Impact tests demonstrated that TCFS specimens satisfy the Class B of the <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> requirements of ANSI Z 97. 1. Comparative LCA results showed that the total life cycle energy of the TCFS was estimated to be 93 % of that of the uncoated GCWS and the total emission of kg CO 2 equivalent for the TCFS was determined as 89 % of the uncoated GCWS. The impact associated with transportation and the end-of-life management was estimated to be insignificant in this study...|$|R

40|$|The {{handling}} of explosives and ammunition introduces a safety risk for personnel and third parties. Accidents related to storage, transport and transhipment {{may result in}} severe injury and material damage. TNO has developed a number of tools to quantify the consequences and risks of accidental explosions. Risk {{is defined as the}} multiplication of the probability of an event and its consequences. The tools differ in their application, considering <b>explosion</b> <b>safety</b> on a military base (within the home country or on a mission), or external safety (related to third parties outside a military base). Some tools are aimed at consequences, others also give risk quantities as output. Risk-NL is our national software for the risk analysis of ammunition storage sites. The individual risk and group risk calculated with Risk-NL have to be compared to Dutch risk criteria. Specifically for transhipment in ports the TNO Transhipment Tool can be employed. In this tool the probability of an accidental explosion depends on the exact type and frequency of the transhipment. The AASTP- 5 Consequence Analysis Tool was developed for military bases abroad, taking into account the protection offered by specific armoured containers against various threats. This tool has been integrated in the latest version of the NATO Field Storage Manual AASTP- 5, and is available for member nations. In the research program ‘Survivability of Compounds’, funded by the Dutch MoD this tool was further developed to predict not only physical consequences, but also consequence for the mission goals (i. e. at the system level). The Klotz Group Engineering Tool has been developed together with international partners in the Klotz Group, a group of explosives safety experts from 8 nations. This tool predicts the hazard from accidental explosions in reinforced concrete ammunition storage sites in detail. By comparing various scenarios the tools described above can also be used in cost-benefit analysis.

On the contrary, the issues of <b>explosion</b> <b>safety</b> for hydrogen methane mixtures are still under investigation. In this work, experimental tests were performed in a 5 L closed cylindrical vessel for explosions of hydrogen methane mixtures in stoichiometric air. Different compositions of hydrogen methane were tested (from pure methane to pure hydrogen) at varying initial pressures (1, 3 and 6 bar). Results have allowed the quantification of the combined effects of both mixture composition (i. e., hydrogen content in the fuel) and initial pressure on maximum pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise and burning velocity. The measured burning velocities were also correlated {{by means of a}} Le Chatelier's Rule-like formula.
