40|$|The {{increasing}} {{competition in}} the air transport industry continuously pushes ground handlers to improve their performance. Recent European regulations prescribe that the managing body of large European airports (more than 5, 000, 000 passengers/year or 100, 000 tonnes/year of freight) have to define quality standards of service level for ground handler operations. In case a handler fails to meet these minimum requirements, the airport has to report it these irregularities, potentially imposing a fine or even suspending, partly or fully, the handler’s services. As always recognized by the passengers, {{one of the most}} critical quality standards is the baggage handling waiting time. This paper defines a method- ology to assess whether the handler fits the requirements of first baggage delivery for both the overall process and the specific segments (<b>flight,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt, departing airport, day of the week, etc.). The methodology, analysing the performance by a two-dimensional perspective (structure and frequency), will help the decision makers in defining mitigating actions to take the performance under statistical control, respecting the requirements and preventing any drift...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) In {{a tender}} bid to energy and {{chemical}} company Sasol, {{a request to}} offer a technical solution for a two-flight overland conveyor system whose function is to transport coal from a 15 000 tonne bunker into an external stockpile storage facility in the plant was made. This conveyor consisted of two <b>conveyor</b> <b>flight</b> sections of lengths 18 423 m and 8 537 m each. The prospect of combining the two <b>flights</b> of <b>conveyors</b> to form one, super-efficient conveyor structure with additional cost saving benefits was identified. It was found that this occurrence was not unique to the individual project as other researching engineers have been faced with similar problems before [18]. This then lead the researcher into believing {{that there could be}} some advantage in investigating the possible benefits to the overall cost, maintainability and scheduling of the fabrication and erection activities for the entire project of combining the multiple <b>flight</b> <b>conveyors</b> into a single-flight conveyor. It is also the conviction of the researcher that the achieved outcomes will prove beneficial to the bulk materials handling industry as a whole. The problem is traditionally short, multiple <b>flight</b> <b>conveyors</b> have always been used for performing the function of transporting bulk material from one location in a mining plant to another hence; long, single-flight overland conveyors of lengths exceeding 26 km have not been commonly installed. In this dissertation the possibility of employing a single-flight overland as opposed to a two-flight conveyor in the Sasol Impumelelo coal plant is investigated. This is done against the work of other researchers who have conducted similar studies in the field as well as by utilizing project-specific data using applicable industry standards as well as Engineering Management course theory. By employing actual project procurement and engineering design data; the investigation is done by calculating and comparing the individual capital and operational costs that encompass the total cost of ownership (TCO) for both conveyor systems as well as the two systems’ reliability, availability and maintainability to establish each system’s complete life cycle costs. It is the opinion of the researcher that the investigation method is valid as it is in line with the guidelines given by The Miami University of Ohio [24] as well as J Hanek [25] and thus provides the researcher with a plausible technique for establishing which between the single-flight overland conveyor and two-flight overland conveyor configurations is overall the more superior system to install. It was found that even though its initial capital and operational costs are higher; the single-flight conveyor system is more reliable, readily available and cheaper to run and sustain over the 30 year expected life-span of the plant. It also is less labour intensive to perform maintenance on, yields less material degradation and results in less material spillage because of the elimination of additional transfer points and transfer towers. These results can be taken as valid on a global scale, for any mining plant, not restricted to any specific material as they are not subject to South African temperature, altitude or seismic conditions nor are they constrained to the type of bulk material being mined...|$|R

40|$|Screw {{conveyors}} {{are used}} extensively in food, plastics, mineral processing, agriculture and processing industries for elevating and/or transporting bulk materials over {{short to medium}} distances. Despite their apparent simplicity in design, the transportation action is very complex for design and constructors have tended to rely heavily on empirical performance data. Screw conveyor performance is affected by its operating conditions (such as: the rotational speed of the screw, the inclination of the screw conveyor, and its volumetric fill level). In this paper, horizontal, several single-pitch screw conveyors with some geometry variations in screw blade was investigated for mixing action during transport, using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The influence of geometry modifications {{on the performance of}} screw conveyor was examined, different screw designs were compared, and the effects of geometrical variations on mixing performances during transport were explored. During the transport, the particle tumbles down {{from the top of the}} helix to the next free surface and that segment of the path was used for auxiliary mixing action. The particle path is dramatically increased with the addition of three complementary helices oriented in the same direction as screw blades (1458. 2 mm compared to 397. 6 mm in case of single <b>flight</b> screw <b>conveyor)</b> Transport route enlarges to 1764. 4 mm, when installing helices oriented in the opposite direction from screw blades.

40|$|Noise induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is the most}} common {{occupational}} disease among workers in the mining industry. Previous studies conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have shown that approximately 90 % of coal miners and 49 % of metal/non-metal miners have a hearing impairment by age 50. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has determined that continuous mining machines rank first among all equipment in underground coal mining whose operators exceed 100 % noise dosage. The conveying system is one of the principal noise sources on continuous mining machines, due to metal on metal impacts that occur between chain <b>flights</b> and the <b>conveyor</b> deck. A highly durable polyurethane coating has been developed for the chain flights to decrease noise generated by these impacts. A continuous mining machine retro-fitted with coated flight bars has achieved overall sound level reductions of 5 - 7 dB in a laboratory setting. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of this engineering noise control in reducing the noise exposure of continuous mining machine operators in an underground coal mine environment. The results show that the operator of a continuous mining machine utilizing the coated flights receives a predicted 35 % reduction in total work shift noise dose...|$|R
40|$|Occupational noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most pervasive health problems in the mining industry, despite over 25 years of regulation. One of the loudest pieces of equipment used in underground mining is the continuous mining machine. Noise sample data collected by the Mine Safety and Health Administration indicate that 42 % of noise overexposures between 2000 and 2005 involved continuous mining machine operators. Previously conducted field and laboratory tests have determined that the continuous mining machine conveyor system is a dominant noise source. Loud impacts occur as the <b>conveyor</b> chain <b>flight</b> bars, used to move the mined aggregate, traverse their path from the top to the underside of the conveyor deck. Various noise control treatments have been applied to abate noise caused by the conveyor system. A durable polyurethane coating has been developed for the <b>conveyor</b> <b>flight</b> bars, resulting in a time-weighted average reduction of 3 dB(A) for an eight-hour work shift. In an attempt to further reduce continuous mining machine operator overexposures, a similar urethane coating has been applied to the tail roller component of the conveyor system. Laboratory results showed a 2 dB(A) reduction in sound power levels, but the component failed during underground durability testing. An outer steel sleeve has been added to the urethane coating of the tail roller to enhance wear resistance during mining. The urethane jacketed tail roller is the latest effort, combined with previous noise treatments, to bring the continuous mining machine into compliance with federal noise regulations...|$|R
