40|$|Simultaneous <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> Trichostrongylus colubriformis and T. vitrinus in {{the small}} {{intestine}} of the sheep were examined by comparing the numbers of worms which established and their distribution within the intestine in both monospecific infections and mixed infections. The results differed depending upon the species and number of parasites. The establishment of T. colubriformis was reduced {{and the distribution of}} the nematode population was displaced posteriorly within the intestine when 30, 000 larvae of both species were administered, compared with pure <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> T. colubriformis. The reduced establishment was less marked with <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> 15, 000 larvae of both species and there was only a slight posterior displacement of T. colubriformis. Neither effect was evident with <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> 7, 500 larvae of both species. The rate of establishment and distribution of T. vitrinus were unaffected by the presence of T. colubriformis at all three rates <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Atrophy <b>of</b> villi and hypertrophy of crypts occurred at the main site <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in the anterior duodenum. The severity of villus atrophy was related to the number of infective larvae administered and/or the worm burden. In the ileum, beyond the main site <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> hypertrophy <b>of</b> villi was only found in sheep receiving the greatest number of infective larvae...|$|R
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> the small or large bowel.

5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were {{infected with the}} beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. <b>Infection</b> <b>of</b> the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into {{the central nervous system}} is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.

5|$|HIV can infect {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used.

Major neglected <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> poverty in the United States include toxocariasis, trichomoniasis, toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, and congenital cytomegalovirus infection (1, 2). Neglected <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> poverty tend to be concentrated in areas of extreme poverty, including post-Katrina Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta, the border with Mexico, Appalachia, tribal lands, and disadvantaged urban areas, where these diseases perpetuate poverty because of their adverse health impact on child development, pregnancy, and worker productivity (1) ...|$|R
