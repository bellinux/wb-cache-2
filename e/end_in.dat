5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> itself; moreover, if it is an <b>end</b> <b>in</b> itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E

5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should <b>end</b> <b>in</b> a win for White, or a draw.

50|$|For group 2 verbs, {{the stem}} <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> a consonant, the infinitive <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> -a, {{and the present}} tense in -er.

For group 2b verbs, the past tense <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> -te and the past participle in -t, -t, and -ta. This is in turn decided by whether the stem <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> a voiced or a voiceless consonant. E.g. The stem of Heta (to be called) is het, and as t is a voiceless consonant the past tense <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> -te, making hette the past tense. If the stem <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> a voiced consonant however, as in Stör-a (to disturb), the past tense <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> -de making störde the past tense.|$|R
