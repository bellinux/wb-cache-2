40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{has been}} to develop a front {{suspension}} of Hi-Per design suitable for a mid- or full size standard car. A Hi-Per suspension is {{a variant of the}} MacPherson strut suspension, with the difference of a steered knuckle and a rigid <b>damper</b> <b>strut.</b> In a MacPherson suspension the whole damper and knuckle assembly is steered, limiting the position of the steering axis by the body mounts of the strut. The designed suspension should fit into the same interface as a suspension of MacPherson type and should be applicable for three different models with different ride heights. The vehicles featuring the new Hi-Per suspension shall have an increased track width making an unchanged MacPherson suspension unsuitable with respect to kingpin offset based phenomena such as torque steer or influence of road disturbances. The base for the Hi-Per design was an available MacPherson vehicle and previous Saab vehicle models, of which one features a Hi-Per suspension design. Within the thesis, solutions available on the market today has been investigated and benchmarked as well as previous solutions within Saab. This has together with the free thinking of the designers hopefully form the best solution possible for the new Hi-Per design. The focus of the suspension has been to achieve a high level of commonality, {{at the same time as}} design requirements of packaging and kinematics are fulfilled together with maintenance and assembly improvements. Within the thesis a large effort has been used for packaging in CAD, at the same time as the geometry is verified by kinematic multi body simulations. This was done in order to fulfil wheel parameters and static design factors of the suspension. Within this thesis a complete pre-study has been performed. This pre-study has resulted in a design proposal, based on the simulation results incorporating Saab vehicle- and suspension requirements. The CAD-models have been designed with regards to clearance during bump, rebound and steering. The models have been designed with similar wall thickness and geometries as the existing Saab Hi-Per solution. The recommendations of this thesis are to continue working with the design proposal with regards to compliance calculations and more specific CAD-designs. There has not been any FE-analysis performed on the parts. Therefore there is a need to further investigate the CAD-models with regards to compliance calculations.

40|$|Objectives of the {{research}} are: (1) to develop design requirements for <b>damped</b> <b>struts</b> to stabilize control system in the high frequency cross-over and spill-over range; (2) to design, fabricate and test viscously <b>damped</b> <b>strut</b> and viscoelastically <b>damped</b> strut; (3) to verify accuracy of design and analysis methodology of damped struts; and (4) to design and build test apparatus, and develop data reduction algorithm to measure strut complex stiffness. In {{order to meet the}} stringent performance requirements of the SPICE experiment, the active control system is used to suppress the dynamic responses of the low order structural modes. However, the control system also inadvertently drives some of the higher order modes unstable in the cross-over and spill-over frequency range. Passive damping is a reliable and effective way to provide damping to stabilize the control system. It also improves the robustness of the control system. Damping is designed into the SPICE testbed {{as an integral part of}} the control-structure technology...|$|R

The front independent suspension uses coil spring and <b>damper</b> <b>struts</b> and lower single link at the front, and at the rear is a four-link system, again with coil springs.

40|$|A {{general design}} {{methodology}} to integrate active control with passive damping was demonstrated on the NASA LaRC CSI Evolutionary Model (CEM), a ground testbed for future large, flexible spacecraft. Vibration suppression controllers designed for Line-of Sight (LOS) minimization were successfully implemented on the CEM. A frequency-shaped H 2 methodology was developed, allowing the designer {{to specify the}} roll-off of the MIMO compensator. A closed loop bandwidth of 4 Hz, including the six rigid body modes and the first three dominant elastic modes of the CEM was achieved. Good agreement was demonstrated between experimental data and analytical predictions for the closed loop frequency response and random tests. Using the Modal Strain Energy (MSE) method, a passive damping treatment consisting of 60 viscoelastically <b>damped</b> <b>struts</b> was designed, fabricated and implemented on the CEM. Damping levels for the targeted modes were more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger than for the undamped structure. Using measured loss and stiffness data for the individual <b>damped</b> <b>struts,</b> analytical predictions of the damping levels were very close to the experimental values in the (1 - 10) Hz frequency range where the open loop model matched the experimental data. An integrated active/passive controller was successfully implemented on the CEM and was evaluated against an active-only controller. A two-fold increase in the effective control bandwidth and further reductions of 30 percent to 50 percent in the LOS RMS outputs were achieved compared to an active-only controller. Superior performance was also obtained compared to a High-Authority/Low-Authority (HAC/LAC) controller...|$|R
40|$|A passive {{damping device}} {{intended}} to replace individual struts in precision truss structures for space applications is described. The theory of {{operation of the}} D-Strut device is detailed, and simple five- and three-parameter models are derived. Results from tests conducted to characterize the D-Strut at submicron displacement levels are reporeted. The incorporation of a strut in a precision truss testbed is described. Parameters determined from the component-level tests are used in a finite element model of the truss, and damping augmentation is predicted. Using the simple three-parameter model, a damper is selected for multiple placement in a separate optical interferometer truss testbed. The effect of {{the addition of the}} <b>damper</b> <b>struts</b> is illustrated analytically in a model of the structure. Finally, an improved Arched Flexure D-Strut that is expected to provide higher loss factors, and is currently under development, is described...|$|R
40|$|Proposed future space {{missions}} involve large structures {{which must}} maintain precise dimensional tolerances even during dynamic maneuvers. In order to attenuate disturbances {{in the many}} modes of vibration of such a structure, active and passive vibration control are proposed. The passive control is to be achieved by placing viscous or viscoelastic members or materials within a structure in order to absorb energy. Ascertaining the best combination of locations for such treatments is difficult due to {{the large number of}} cases, each of which requires computationally expensive complex eigenvalue analyses of a finite element model to compute modal damping values;In this work, a simple model is developed and used to accurately estimate modal damping ratio for any damping case based on {{a relatively small number of}} real eigenvalue (normal mode) analyses. The motion of the spring-mass system assumed by this compliant model is modified by placing the damper to be added in series with another stiffness inherent to the structure for each mode and damper location. The compliant models for various modes are then integrated into a unified spherical model. The resulting expression for damping is easily evaluated and optimized. The method is compared to other means of estimating damping such as modal strain energy and reduced vector subspace;Using the spherical compliant model, optimization proceeds much more quickly than would be possible using direct evaluation of modal damping using complex eigenvalue analysis. Once the damping performance criterion is established, the individual candidate locations for <b>damping</b> <b>struts</b> are ranked according to their contribution to similar performance criteria. Locations which span the octahedral cells of the tetrahedron truss of the bulkhead of the example SPICE structure rank highest;To find the optimal locations, combinations of <b>damping</b> <b>strut</b> locations are selected, using the highest ranking strut locations first. Each combination is optimized for damping by golden section using the compliant model. Augmented probabilities based on strut rankings aid a simulated annealing algorithm in selecting each combination to be evaluated...|$|R

The cabin stretched from forward of the wing to well behind it with almost continuous glazing {{on both sides and}} could accommodate up to six people including the pilot. It could also be configured to carry two stretchers plus attendant and pilot. There were doors to the front seats on both sides and a third, port side, passenger door [...] Beyond the cabin the fuselage the straight upper fuselage line continued but sides and bottom tapered to the tail. The IS-23's tall, fixed tricycle undercarriage had each main wheel supported from the fuselage centre line by a pair of asymmetric V-legs with a separate <b>damping</b> <b>strut,</b> mounted on the outer fuselage bottom, attached to the aft one.

50|$|It was a water-cooled, {{front wheel}} drive design in a {{hatchback}} body style. It featured firmly sprung and <b>damped,</b> independent MacPherson <b>strut</b> front suspension and semi-independent twist-beam rear suspension, that gave crisp handling and good roadholding, without being too uncomfortable. A very important model was the Golf Diesel, which appeared in late 1976. This was remarkable in how unremarkable it was, with performance {{very similar to that}} of a petrol 1100. The 1.5-litre engine used the petrol engine's crankshaft, bearings, and connecting rods, combined with the recently discontinued 1471 cc cast-iron engine block. As with the Golf GTi, the Golf Diesel more or less created a new class of car.|$|R

The A-Spec suspension featured lowering springs (approximately 0.75 inch) and revalved dampers. The ride was stiffer, but not overly so, and handling was improved with less body roll, more controlled cornering and enhanced feel. Reportedly Acura chose {{to make the}} RL's A-Spec suspension more compliant than the very stiff A-Spec sport suspension upgrade for the Acura TL, {{in keeping with the}} two different missions of the cars: luxury for the RL, luxury sport for the TL. Acura RL A-Spec retained the same suspension geometry as the stock Acura RL suspension alignment specifications.|$|R
40|$|Micro-vibration {{on board}} a {{spacecraft}} {{is an important issue}} that affects payloads requiring high pointing accuracy. Although isolators have been extensively studied and implemented to tackle this issue, their application is far from being ideal due to the several drawbacks that they present, such as limited low-frequency attenuation for passive systems or high power consumption and reliability issues for active systems. In the present study, a novel 2 -collinear-DoF strut with embedded electromagnetic shunt dampers (EMSD) is modelled, analysed and the concept is physically tested. The combination of high-inductance components and negative-resistance circuits is used in the two shunt circuits to improve the EMSD micro-vibration mitigation and to achieve an overall <b>strut</b> <b>damping</b> performance that is characterised by the elimination of the resonance peaks and a remarkable FRF final decay rate of ‚àí 80 dB dec‚Äì 1. The EMSD operates without requiring any control algorithm and can be comfortably integrated on a satellite due to the low power required, the simplified electronics and the small mass. This work demonstrates, both analytically and experimentally, that the proposed strut is capable of producing better isolation performance than other well-established damping solutions over the whole temperature range of interest...|$|R
40|$|This work {{establishes}} a comprehensive and fully parametric {{model for the}} damped vibrations of Gough-Stewart Platforms (GSPs) at symmetric configurations. It is noteworthy that in the literature a complete {{solution to this problem}} has not been presented. This work has been carried out in three stages which are the subjects of Papers I, II and III. After the industrial stage of the work which is reflected in Paper I, we have generalized the problem and established a fully parametric model of the damped vibrations of GSPs in Paper II and finally extended the model by taking inertia of the struts into consideration in Paper III. The final model is parametrically developed in terms of all the design variables of the system and can be directly employed for the analysis, optimization and control of GSPs. In this work, we parametrically formulate the kinematic equations which are eventually obtained {{in the form of a}} Jacobian matrix. The focus of this work is on the Cartesian-space formulation in which Bryant angles, due to their advantages over Euler angles, are chosen to represent the orientation of the platform. The equations of motion are formulated and linearized based on a Lagrangian dynamics approach where Rayleigh axial <b>damping</b> of the <b>struts</b> is introduced to the system. Inertia, stiffness and damping matrices are parametrically formulated. By introducing the inertia of the struts, the inertia matrix turned out to be quite complicated to formulate. Interestingly, despite its apparent symmetrical geometry, the equivalent inertia matrix is obtained as a non-diagonal matrix. The eigenvectors and damped eigenfrequencies of the system are then parametrically established. In addition, the decoupled vibrations are analytically investigated where it is shown that the consideration of strut inertia may lead to significant changes of the decoupled conditions. Finally, for a reference GSP, the vibrational behavior with respect to different design variables are systematically studied...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{deals with}} the elastic and stress {{analysis}} of a side-load spring, which is employed in cars belonging to the medium segment of the European automotive market. In the design {{of this kind of}} spring both the elastic characteristics and the fatigue strength have to be considered as significant aspects. Side-load springs, indeed, have a thrust axis which results in skew with respect to the damper axis; for this reason they are widely employed in front McPherson automotive suspensions in order to minimize the side force acting on the <b>strut</b> <b>damper,</b> which is responsible for the undesired damper-sticking phenomenon. In addition to this particular elastic property, {{as a consequence of the}} research effort in reducing the mass of components typical of the automotive industry, these springs have to face very high working stresses. The structural reliability of the spring must therefore be ensured by high residual stresses, which are induced by presetting and shot peening treatment at the end of the manufacturing process. The evolution of the thrust axis during suspension travel was analysed by a finite element (FE) model of the spring‚Äìseats assembly, built starting from a three-dimensional (3 D) scan of the spring. In addition an experimental campaign was planned in order to measure the residual stresses at several points along the spring by X-ray diffraction. The actual stresses were then obtained as the superposition of those produced by the external loads, computed by means of the FE model, and the measured residual stresses. The beneficial effect of residual stresses on the structural reliability is discussed with a theoretical fatigue analysis on the basis of different multiaxial criteria. A mechanism of residual stress generation, based on the superposition of stresses coming from presetting and shot peening, is also suggested with the aid of FE simulations...|$|R
