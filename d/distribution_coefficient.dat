5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E

40|$|Bimetallic {{nanoparticles}} (BNPs) often possess peculiar segregation {{behavior as}} the particle size, composition, shape, and temperature are varied. However, a thermodynamic model for this phenomenon has been lacking thus far. We {{show for the}} first time that the distribution of metal species within a nanoparticle can be adequately captured in terms of <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficients</b> calculated for the facets, facet edges, and bulk regions. Thermodynamic relations for the <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficients</b> are derived. Only m <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficients</b> from the m(m - 1) <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficients</b> are independent, where m denotes the number of regions. The theory is applied to AuPt, NiPt, and AuAg BNPs. <b>Distribution</b> <b>coefficients</b> are calculated at 400 and 600 K using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of varying BNP sizes and compositions. A wide range of mixing behavior from alloying to partial or full segregation and core-shell to onion-like structures can be observed. A key finding is that the <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficients</b> are independent of the BNP size. The observed size-dependent segregation can be attributed to the relative availability of surface and bulk sites, i. e., the area-to-volume (A/V) ratio. This implies that two bimetallic nanostructures of different sizes and shapes but the same A/V ratio may exhibit nearly identical segregation behavior. Thus, nanothermodynamic segregation in bimetallic alloys may be described concisely using a handful of <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficients...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Atom-based: Standard {{approaches}} of this type, using atomic contributions, {{have been named}} by those formulating them with a prefix letter: AlogP, XlogP, MlogP, etc. A conventional method for predicting log P through this type of method is to parameterize the <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficient</b> contributions of various atoms to the over-all molecular partition coefficient, which produces a parametric model. This parametric model can be estimated using constrained least-squares estimation, using a training set of compounds with experimentally measured partition coefficients. [...] In order to get reasonable correlations, the most common elements contained in drugs (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and halogens) are divided into several different atom types depending on {{the environment of the}} atom within the molecule.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{pharmacodynamics}} (what a drug does to the body), the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force for the binding of drugs to their receptor targets. [...] On the other hand, hydrophobic drugs {{tend to be more}} toxic because they, in general, are retained longer, have a wider distribution within the body (e.g., intracellular), are somewhat less selective in their binding to proteins, and finally are often extensively metabolized. In some cases the metabolites may be chemically reactive. [...] Hence it is advisable to make the drug as hydrophilic as possible while it still retains adequate binding affinity to the therapeutic protein target. For cases where a drug reaches its target locations through passive mechanisms (i.e., diffusion through membranes), the ideal <b>distribution</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the drug is typically intermediate in value (neither too lipophilic, nor too hydrophilic); in cases where molecules reach their targets otherwise, no such generalization applies.|$|E
