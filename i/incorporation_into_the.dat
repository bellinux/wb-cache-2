5|$|<b>Incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>The</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{resulted}} in an economic, political and ethno-cultural unification of Belarusian lands. Of the principalities held by the Duchy, nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become Belarusian people. During this time, the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including fighting {{on the side of}} Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410; the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Following its <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire in 1517, Nablus was {{designated}} {{capital of the}} Jabal Nablus ("Mount Nablus") district. In 1657, {{after a series of}} upheavals, a number of Arab clans from the northern and eastern Levant were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority, and loyalty from among these clans staved off challenges to the empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century, and Muhammad Ali—who briefly ruled Nablus—in the 19th century. When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{information}} {{learned from the}} 2002 and 2006 expeditions, there was {{public support for the}} making of Davidson Seamount into a marine sanctuary. A key group of research scientists, fishermen, officials, educators, and marine biologists was formed in 2006 to discuss whether or not to make Davidson Seamount a National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and if so whether to make it its own sanctuary, or incorporate it into the nearby Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The group decided that the seamount was eligible for sanctuary designation, and the majority of the group recommended its <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nearby Monterey Bay sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|In 1622 a {{military}} expedition {{set out from}} Yucatán led by Captain Francisco de Mirones and accompanied by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado; this expedition was a disaster, and the Spanish were massacred by the Itza. In 1628 the Manche Ch'ol of the south were placed under {{the administration of the}} colonial governor of Verapaz within the Captaincy General of Guatemala. The Manche Ch'ol unsuccessfully rebelled against Spanish control in 1633. In 1695 {{a military}} expedition tried to reach Lake Petén Itzá from Guatemala; this was followed in 1696 by missionaries from Mérida and in 1697 by Martín de Ursúa's expedition from Yucatán that resulted in the final defeat of the independent kingdoms of central Petén and their <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Empire.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and {{the revival of the}} Hebrew language and culture. The movement was publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E
5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's time {{to complete}} and provide the finishing touches to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, who suggested Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was too complicated. The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{negotiating}} the actual arrangements {{turned out to}} be difficult and lasted from 1563 to 1569, with the Lithuanian magnates, worried about losing their dominant position, being at times uncooperative. It took Sigismunt II's unilateral declaration of the <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Polish Crown of substantial disputed border regions, including most of Lithuanian Ukraine, to make the Lithuanian magnates rejoin the process, and participate in the swearing of the act of the Union of Lublin on July 1, 1569. Lithuania for the near future was becoming more secure on the eastern front. It's increasingly Polonized nobility made in the coming centuries great contributions to the Commonwealth's culture, but at the cost of Lithuanian national development.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Rova as a seat {{of power}} for the Kingdom of Imerina changed when Andriamasinavalona chose to divide the kingdom into four provinces ruled by his {{favourite}} sons. Antananarivo became {{the capital of the}} southern Imerina province with the Rova as its seat of government. The site retained this role until the late 18th century, when King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810) of Ambohimanga led a series of attacks beginning in 1792 that culminated in the capture of Antananarivo and its <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> newly reunified Kingdom of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was {{finalized}} on 17 April 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing Empire to Japan. Taiwan's <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Japanese political orbit brought Taiwanese aborigines {{into contact}} with a new colonial structure, determined to define and locate indigenous people {{within the framework of}} a new, multi-ethnic empire. The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms: anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan, attempts to reshape the aborigines in the mould of the Japanese, and military suppression. The Aboriginals and Han joined together to violently revolt against Japanese rule in the 1907 Beipu Uprising and 1915 Tapani Incident.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the fourth}} Silent Hill game by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo's {{development}} group Team Silent began shortly {{after the release of}} Silent Hill 2 and alongside Silent Hill 3, with the intentions of creating a new style of game that would take the series in a different direction than the previous games. Despite what has been popularized around the Internet, Silent Hill 4 was always meant to be connected to Silent Hill and not an unrelated separate horror game that later became a Silent Hill title, although different gameplay mechanics and change were intended. News of the game's development was made public by October 2003, and official announcements by Konami followed at Gamers' Day 2004. The game was produced by the series' recurring sound designer and composer Akira Yamaoka. Its working title, prior to its <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rest of the series, was simply Room 302.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} now {{incorporated into}} El Salvador was not politically unified {{at the time}} of Spanish contact. As with neighbouring regions, this hindered the progress of <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Empire, as each small kingdom had to be overcome in turn; this contrasted with Mexico where a large empire had been rapidly overcome with the fall of its capital, Tenochtitlan. As Spanish authority gradually spread out from Mexico and Panama, this left El Salvador in an intermediate region temporarily beyond Spanish control. Spanish colonial towns were founded according to the whim of individual conquistadors, with no formal planning of their location or of communication routes between them, often leaving them isolated. In 1548, El Salvador was formally placed within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, which extended along the Central American isthmus from Chiapas, now in southern Mexico, to Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|His son Charles I {{attempted}} to impose {{elements of the}} English religious settlement on his other kingdoms. Relations gradually deteriorated resulting in the Bishops' Wars (1637–40), ending in defeat for Charles and helping {{to bring about the}} War of Three Kingdoms. The Scots entered the war in England on the Parliamentary side, helping to turn the tide against the king's forces. In the Second and Third Civil Wars (1648–51) they took the side of Charles I and after his execution that of his son Charles II, leading to defeat, occupation by a parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell and <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 saw the return of episcopacy and an increasingly absolutist regime, resulting in religious and political upheaval and rebellions. With the accession of the openly Catholic James VII, there was increasing disquiet among Protestants. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89, William of Orange and Mary, the daughter of James, were accepted as monarchs. Presbyterianism was reintroduced and limitations placed on monarchy. After severe economic dislocation in the 1690s there were moves that led to political union with England as the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The deposed main hereditary line of the Stuarts became a focus for political discontent, known as Jacobitism, leading to a series of invasions and rebellions, but with the defeat of the last in 1745, Scotland entered a period of great political stability, economic and intellectual expansion.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of estradiol upon <b>incorporation</b> of isotopes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides of connective tissues {{of the rat}} has been studied. Administration of the hormone for 3 weeks significantly reduces the in vitro incorporation of S 35 -sulfate into cartilage and thoracic aorta without significantly altering the amount of hydrolyzable sulfate in these tissues. The reduction of sulfate <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> these tissues by estradiol represents reduced synthesis since the hormone reduces <b>incorporation</b> of sulfate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> acid mucopolysaccharides of the tissue {{to the same extent}} and since reduction in incorporation of C 14 -glucose also parallels S 35 -sulfate <b>incorporation</b> <b>into</b> acid mucopolysaccharides. <b>The</b> rate of synthesis of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides is greater in thoracic aorta than abdominal aorta or cartilage. Since the amount of hydrolyzable sulfate is the same in these two portions of aorta, the turnover is also more rapid in the thoracic aorta...|$|R
