After {{a leave of absence}} due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> with his partners Kravis and Roberts. In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.|$|E

5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, bad weather {{prevented}} more large attacks. On 9 and 11 September, only smaller raids were carried out.

ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from ULTRA at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, {{it would not have been}} difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to be a clear day.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{this period}} the pro-independence forces made two {{important}} advances. In the Southern Cone, a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, José de San Martín, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San Martín's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Martín de Pueyrredón became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the Río de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Martín together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Martín had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.|$|E

After taking time off from his career to earn a Master of Business Administration, Vipond worked <b>in</b> <b>Strategy</b> and Corporate Development at the Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. from 2012 to 2015 where he made a $2.6 billion unsolicited bid to buy Osisko Mining. In 2013, while working at Goldcorp, Vipond founded Mathers Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Vancouver. Mathers Pacific Capital works with Vancouver-area companies to help them raise capital, complete mergers and acquisitions, and grow their businesses. In March 2015, Vipond became Vice President of Corporate Finance at Shoes.com, while also continuing to run Mathers Pacific Capital and the Corporate Finance Institute, which is a subdivision of Mathers Pacific Capital. Prior to joining Shoes.com, Vipond worked as a consultant for its owner, Roger Hardy and in 2014, spearheaded the firm's purchase of Shoeme.ca and OnlineShoes.com. These purchases helped bring Shoes.com into the online shoe-selling business and shortly after joining Shoes.com, he oversaw the completion of a non-brokered $45 million private placement. It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact on such an mining investment.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} the switch <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> is disputed. Some historians argue the change <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> lost the Luftwaffe the {{opportunity}} of winning the air battle, or air superiority. Others argue the Luftwaffe achieved little in the air battle and the RAF {{was not on the}} verge of collapse, as often claimed. Another perspective has also been put forward, which suggests the Germans could not have gained air superiority before the weather window closed. Others have said that it was unlikely the Luftwaffe would ever be able to destroy RAF Fighter Command. If British losses became severe, the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped. It could then deploy when, or if, the Germans launched an invasion. Most historians agree Sea Lion would have failed regardless, because of the weaknesses of German sea power compared to the Royal Navy.|$|E
