Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950 English season, however, he ventured {{abroad for}} the first time, taking part in a Commonwealth tour of India and Sri Lanka and opening the batting in all five of the {{representative}} games. He had some success on the tour, scoring one century, {{the only one of the}} 50 centuries in his career not to be made for Somerset. Perhaps more typically, he was homesick and unhappy: [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> I'd picked up a bug. But it was purely mental," [...] he said in a tape transcribed in his biography. Lighter by about 12kg, he struggled for runs more than usually in the 1951 season, and took a long break from cricket in July, returning to some form afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{thoughts}} and attempts I made to practice [...] were suggested by a question which {{occurred to me}} in 1946 as I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was {{what are the chances}} that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After {{spending a lot of time}} trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> a more practical method than [...] "abstract thinking" [...] might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, and I immediately thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later , I described the idea to John von Neumann, and we began to plan actual calculations.|$|E

I wondered,' said Little Dorrit, looking at him in a suppliant way, and {{gradually}} withdrawing her eyes {{as he looked at}} her, 'whether you would advise me what I ought to do.' ...|$|E
