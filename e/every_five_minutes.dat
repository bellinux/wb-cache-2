5|$|WWV {{had been}} {{broadcasting}} second pulses since 1937, but these pulses were {{not tied to}} actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO's clock {{as a source for}} its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> Frequencies of 600Hz and 440Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35MHz. The 30 and 35MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.|$|E

Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a cyclist could not get more than 11 points more than the cyclist that crossed the finish line just before him.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
25|$|The clock face {{used for}} this era {{featured}} a black background clock with the '2' and BBC logo on the left hand side with a black clock face on the right. Every minute was marked in white, with large Roman numerals <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minute</b> mark. This clock design lasted for a small while, when it was altered to a grey background.|$|R

5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane {{would need to be}} refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in Hannover, Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained in the cockpit with the pistol to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> German authorities allowed the plane to depart after Demeke threatened to kill his hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States.|$|E
5|$|Pearce {{stars as}} a man who, {{as a result of}} a past trauma, suffers from {{anterograde}} amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and suffers short-term memory loss approximately <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E
5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E

25|$|In {{time-based}} prospective memory tasks, {{participants are}} asked to remember to perform a task {{at a certain point}} in time. There are also numerous possible types of time-based tasks.

On most suburban lines, trains depart <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> On Sundays these time intervals are doubled.|$|E
40|$|The cardiac {{action of}} {{digitoxin}} {{is associated with}} the amount of digitoxin perfused in the heart, which is suggested to be affected by the amount taken up in extracardial tissues. Lethal doses of digitoxin were determined with cats and guinea pigs in order to estimate the cardiac action. Digitoxin was injected <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minute</b> in jugural, femoral or mesenteric vein or aorta, under normal conditions or after the blockade of portal circulation. The data indicated the following conclusions : A large amount of digitoxin in blood stream is arrested by the first passage through extracardial tissues especially in the abdominal area. The lethal doce per unit body weight is approximately two times larger in guinea pigS than in cats, but the difference disappears after the abdominal organs have been shut off from the circulation of blood. It is, therefore, probable that the difference of the lethal dose between guinea pigs and cats is mainly due to the difference of the capacity of digitoxin uptake in abdominal organ...|$|R

In 2008, the system carried 3.55 million riders. Despite the fact the shuttle service is free, it is {{comparatively}} inexpensive to operate: with an operating cost of $4.55 million in 2008, the operating subsidy was only $1.28 per passenger. Even Metro Transit's busy METRO Blue Line light rail required a subsidy of $1.44 that year, and that was with many riders paying $1.75 or more for a ride.|$|E

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition, the Frogner Line was extended from Frogner plass to Majorstuen. It was officially opened on 15 May 1914. From the services became a ring line: Line 1 ran Jernbanetorget‚ÄìBriskeby‚ÄìMajorstuen‚ÄìFrogner‚ÄìJernbanetorget, while Line 2 was designated to run the opposite direction. They were both run <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> The circle scheme was ended on 15 December 1915 and the Briskeby Line again became Line 1. However, this was unpopular with the passengers and the circle service was reintroduced on 24 February 1916. Line 1 was extended from Jernbanetorget along the Gamlebyen Line between 17 December 1917 to 1 October 1918. Six-minute services were introduced from 25 March 1920, five-minute headways from 19 July 1920 and six-minute headways from 25 July 1921.|$|E

25|$|Numbered {{services}} {{were introduced in}} 1909. KES {{was the first of}} the two tramways to introduce numbered lines and secured the lowest digits. The Briskeby Line was numbered 1, the Frogner Line 2 and the Sk√∏yen Line 3. The increased rolling stock allowed most services to run <b>every</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> from 1910. KES and KSS reached an agreement in 1912 to coordinate their services better. This first materialized in a connecting line in Hegdehaugsveien, which allowed trams to run from Stortorvet via the Ullev√•l Hageby Line to Majorstuen. At Skillebekk a connection was built through Munkedamsveien, allowing the Vestbanen Line access to the Sk√∏yen Line. In conjunction with the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition at Frogner, the Frogner Line was extended along Kirkeveien to Majorstuen on 15 May 1914. In September a new depot opened at Majorstuen, with place for 75 vehicles‚Äîthe largest in Scandinavia.|$|E
