5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory.

In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E

5|$|In 1995 a {{longitudinal}} study was conducted at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of Sesame Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using people, probably with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled population. Changes in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> impact on the native population.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> impact on water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed {{the composition of the}} lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
