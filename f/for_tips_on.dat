25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play <b>for</b> <b>tips</b> <b>on</b> street corners or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959 Adams {{starred in}} the ABC series The Rebel playing the {{character}} Johnny Yuma, a wandering, ex-Confederate, journal-keeping, sawed-off shotgun toting [...] "trouble-shooter" [...] in the old American west. He is credited as a co-creator of The Rebel, {{but he had no}} role in writing the pilot or any of the series' episodes. Adams had asked his friend Andrew J. Fenady to write the pilot as a starring vehicle for him. The series' only recurring character, publicized as a [...] "Reconstruction beatnik", was played by Adams. He reportedly consulted with John Wayne <b>for</b> <b>tips</b> <b>on</b> how to play the role. Adams wanted Presley to sing the theme song for The Rebel, but the show's producer wanted Johnny Cash, who made it a hit. Guest stars appearing on the series during its two-year run included Dan Blocker, Johnny Cash, Leonard Nimoy, Tex Ritter, and Robert Vaughn. A total of 76 half-hour episodes were filmed before the series was cancelled in 1961. Reruns were syndicated for several years. Adams went back to TV and film work, along with a role in the short-lived but critically successful television series Saints and Sinners.|$|E

30|$|The {{only way}} how to {{systematically}} monitor the actual approach quality is to monitor the cantilever amplitude during approach. If the amplitude drops close to zero, albeit briefly, the tip may be damaged as evidenced in Figure 6. This is in particular critical <b>for</b> silicon-based <b>tips</b> <b>on</b> hard substrates such as diamond. Moreover, if the feedback value is too high during approach, tip will start to oscillate immediately after contact. These oscillations may also damage the tip. If the FB value during approach is too low, the scanner response will be slow and cantilever may hit the surface as well.|$|R

In Codeword - Golden Fleece (1946) the Duke and his friends attempted to cripple the German war effort by business intrigues involving oil barges in neutral States among the Danube. In Strange Conflict (1941) the Duke was instrumental in foiling the activities of a Nazi occultist, based in a location to be discovered, which were threatening the Atlantic convoys.
