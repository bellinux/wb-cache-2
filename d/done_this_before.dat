5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II was {{developed}} by Atlus for the Super Famicom. It was directed by Koji Okada, produced by Hideyuki Yokoyama, and written by Ryutaro Ito, with music composed by Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko designed the game's characters, but was also involved in the planning phase. During the game's pre-production, the development staff visited Hariti's temple in Zōshigaya and Taira no Masakado's grave to cleanse themselves. They had <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> first during {{the development of the}} first Shin Megami Tensei; after one of the staff members got robbed, they decided to do it regularly. The inspiration to do this came from Go Nagai, who was said to have exorcised a spirit with the help of Hariti while writing the manga Devilman.|$|E
25|$|Ashwin is {{also the}} third Indian cricketer to be awarded the Man of the Match (MoM) on debut. Other Indians to have <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> him were Narendra Hirwani, Pravin Amre, R.P. Singh. Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan {{achieved}} this feat after Ashwin. Ashwin registered the second best bowling on debut by an Indian bowler with 9/128, behind Hirwani's 16-wicket world record debut performance. Ashwin became the fastest Indian to record 50 wickets in Test matches as he overhauled the milestone in his ninth game. He achieved it when he dismissed the England opener Nick Compton on 16 November 2012 during {{the second day of}} the first Test at Ahmedabad. The previous record holder was the legendary Anil Kumble, who had reached the milestone in his tenth Test. On 8 December 2012, Ashwin completed 500 runs in his 11th Test cricket match when batting against England scoring 91*. With this he shares the record of becoming the fastest player along with Australia's Jack Gregory and England's Ian Botham, who also took 11 Tests to reach the mark of completing the all-round double of 500 runs and 50 wickets. Incidentally, the quickest Indian to reach 500 runs and 50 wickets before Ashwin was Salim Durani who did so in his 14th Test.|$|E

Before {{the premiere of}} the episode, OfficeTally—the largest fan site for the series—was given a message by the show's producers that urged fans to watch [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] due to the major reveal {{at the end of}} the episode. Reportedly, the producers had never <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by 4.19 million viewers and received a 2.0 rating/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.0 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The Office ranked third in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.0/8 percent rating, and an installment of the Fox series Glee which received a 2.6/7 percent rating. The Office was the highest-rated NBC television program on the night it aired. 2.04 million viewers watched the episode through DVR playback, bringing the total viewership to 6.24 million.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Drood {{is unusual}} {{in part because of}} Holmes' feat of writing the book, music, lyrics, and full orchestrations for the show. [...] Though Holmes {{believed}} no Broadway creator had <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> and despite frequent mentions of this feat in articles and reviews of the show, the practice was not entirely uncommon {{in the early days of}} musical theater.

2500|$|Originally, Magneto made a brief {{appearance}} in a cutscene in [...] {{lying on the}} floor next to Professor X, both having been defeated by Doctor Doom. However, the new Xbox 360 downloadable content features him (with his classic costume, 1980s costume, Ultimate costume, and Xorn as alternate costumes) as a playable character with Richard Green reprising his role. Magneto has special dialogue with Professor X and Fin Fang Foom. He also have a special dialogue with Arcade while triggering a disco ball in the Fun House of Murderworld, which was never used in the game. Additionally, there are unconfirmed rumors, which turns out to be a PC mod patch, created by a modder that if one uses Magneto in Mephisto's Realm after defeating Blackheart, he can save both Jean Grey and Nightcrawler, rather than letting one fall into the Void, in which other telekinetic users like Doctor Strange and Invisible Woman should have <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There were {{hopes that}} England {{could make the}} 405 runs for victory on the now flat pitch, but these were soon dispelled when Amiss, Lloyd and Cowdrey were out with 10 runs {{on the board and}} Lillee 2/0. Lillee (4/69) and Walker (3/83) were able to swing the ball and Amiss picked up his second pair against Australia, having <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> at Old Trafford in 1968. Cowdrey was taken by a low left-handed catch by Mallett in the gully [...] "that those who were not present would not believe". Ian Chappell decided to feed Denness's {{favourite}} cut and stationed Jenner at fly-slip while Lillee bowled outside off-stump, the captain duly cut and was out for 14. The lanky Greig played over a low ball from Walker {{and by the end of}} the day England were 94/5, thanks mainly to Fletcher's 39. The following day Fletcher and Knott took 15 runs off Lillee's first over and their fifty partnership came up in 51 minutes against the spin of Jenner and Mallett. Lillee had Fletcher lbw on his return when a yorker hit the Essex-man's toe and he was reluctantly out for 63 at 144/6. Knott made his fourth fifty of the series and he and Titmus made 50 runs in even time. Jenner went round the wicket and bowled googlies at Titmus as if he were an off-spinner and rapped him on the pads three times in a row without playing a stroke, the third producing a lbw decision from the umpire. Mallett bowled a spell of 2/1 off 8 overs; Underwood caught at grass level by Ian Chappell and Arnold bowled, both making pairs like Amiss. This left England 217/9 and Knott quickly cut his way to a century, the first by an England keeper against Australia since Les Ames at Lords in 1934, Ames being at Adelaide to congratulate his fellow Man of Kent. He made an unbeaten 106 when Willis was out and England were dismissed for 241.|$|E
