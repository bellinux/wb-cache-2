5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of <b>drawing</b> <b>down</b> U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s and 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} in Neodruidism {{as well as}} the rise of Germanic neopaganism and Ásatrú in the United States and in Iceland. In the 1970s, Wicca was notably influenced by feminism, leading to the creation of an eclectic, Goddess-worshipping movement known as Dianic Wicca. The 1979 publication of Margot Adler's <b>Drawing</b> <b>Down</b> the Moon and Starhawk's The Spiral Dance opened a new chapter in public awareness of paganism.|$|E

Only two additional Army pilots were killed flying the mail after the resumption of operations, on March 30 and April 5.|$|E
25|$|Hekhalot ("Heavenly Palaces") are not {{a single}} text. Rather, they are a genre of {{writings}} with shared characteristics. These texts primarily focus either on how to achieve a heavenly ascent through the Heichalot (heavenly palaces) and what to expect there, or on <b>drawing</b> <b>down</b> angelic spirits to interact and help the adept. There are several larger documents of the heichalot, such as Hekhalot Rabbati, in which six of the seven palaces of God are described, Hekhalot Zutarti, Shiur Komah and 6th-century 3 Enoch, as well as hundreds of small documents, many little more than fragments.|$|E
25|$|As a full band, Beherit {{released}} one full-length {{album and}} many demos and compilations of raw and minimalistic black metal. They disbanded {{soon after the}} release of the experimental 1993 album <b>Drawing</b> <b>Down</b> the Moon, which is now considered a classic of the genre. Laiho, the group's frontman, continued as a solo project and released two more albums under the band's name, H418ov21.C in 1994 and Electric Doom Synthesis in 1995. These albums are usually categorized as dark ambient. Although they were completely electronic, the albums carried the atmosphere of the band's black metal recordings. Original members Nuclear Holocausto and Sodomatic Slaughter reformed the band in 2008, now a four-piece featuring new members Ancient Corpse Desekrator and Abyss.|$|E

25|$|The FDIC {{announced}} its intent, on September 29, 2009, {{to assess the}} banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums {{in an effort to}} avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of <b>drawing</b> <b>down</b> banks' statutory capital abruptly, {{at the time of the}} assessment.|$|E
25|$|Operation Barbarossa {{was planned}} as a blitzkrieg {{intended}} {{to last a}} few weeks. By the autumn of 1941 {{it was clear that}} this the operation would not accomplish its goals, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly Murmansk. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times. Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by <b>drawing</b> <b>down</b> shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps {{in the hope that the}} Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany.|$|E

500|$|Bull of Heaven was {{positively}} reviewed by Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White in The Pomegranate academic journal, who {{asserted that the}} book was [...] "eloquently and engagingly written", and was important for documenting the life not only of Buczynski, but also of other important figures in the New York Pagan scene, like Herman Slater and Leo Martello. He praised Lloyd's research as [...] "thorough and far-reaching", although was critical of the poor quality of the images. Noting that the book's scope would invite comparison with Chas S. Clifton's Her Hidden Children and Adler's <b>Drawing</b> <b>Down</b> the Moon, he labelled it a [...] "must read" [...] {{for those interested in}} the history of American Paganism and gay liberation, summing it up as [...] "the finest independent Pagan studies scholarship to have been produced in the United States to date."

It {{was released in}} 1993 as the band's first official LP. The album was named after an ancient ritual, [...] "drawing down the Moon". The album was highly experimental within the black metal scene, as the band used whispers and space-like electronic and synth sounds to strengthen its hypnotic atmosphere. <b>Drawing</b> <b>Down</b> the Moon was reissued by Candlelight Records in 2006.|$|E

Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended <b>drawing</b> <b>down</b> the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.|$|E
