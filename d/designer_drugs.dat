5000|$|... 3,4-Dimethylmethcathinone (3,4-DMMC) is a {{stimulant}} drug {{first reported}} in 2010 as a <b>designer</b> <b>drug</b> analogue of mephedrone, apparently produced {{in response to}} the banning of mephedrone, following its widespread abuse in many countries in Europe and around the world. 3,4-DMMC has been seized as a <b>designer</b> <b>drug</b> in Australia.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the high}} {{priority}} {{given by the}} Dutch government to fighting illegal drug trafficking, the Netherlands continue {{to be an important}} transit point for drugs entering Europe. The Netherlands is a major producer and leading distributor of cannabis, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and other synthetic drugs, and a medium consumer of illicit drugs. Despite the crackdown by Interpol on traffic and illicit manufacture of temazepam, the country has also become a major exporter of illicit temazepam of the jelly variety, trafficking it to the United Kingdom and other European nations. The Netherlands' special synthetic drug unit, set up in 1997 to coordinate the fight against <b>designer</b> <b>drugs,</b> appears to be successful. The government has intensified cooperation with neighbouring countries and stepped up border controls. In recent years, it also introduced so-called 100% checks and bodyscans at Schiphol Airport on incoming flights from Dutch overseas territories Aruba and Netherlands Antilles to prevent importing cocaine by means of swallowing balloons by mules.|$|E
500|$|Mephedrone {{is one of}} {{hundreds}} of <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> or legal highs that have been reported in recent years, including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as methylhexanamine. These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label of <b>designer</b> <b>drugs.</b> According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by Saem de Burnaga Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, under the name [...] "toluyl-alpha-monomethylaminoethylcetone", but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003, when it was [...] "re-discovered" [...] and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website, working under the pseudonym [...] "Kinetic". Kinetic posted on the site, [...] "I’ve been bored {{over the last couple of}} days and had a few fun reagents lying around, so I thought I’d try and make some 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-methylaminopropanone hydrochloride, or 4-methylmethcathinone." [...] before going on to describe that after taking it, the user had a [...] "fantastic sense of well-being that I haven’t got from any drug before except my beloved Ecstasy." [...] In interviews Kinetic was described as [...] "a mathematician who used to design sleeping pills for a major pharmaceutical company" [...] and he stated that he was based in Israel when he rediscovered mephedrone.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Xenomania's News Blog {{reported}} that Annie {{was back in}} the studio recording her follow-up to 2009's [...] "Don't Stop". Annie started recording in August 2010 with Brian Higgins at Xenomania's studios in Kent, England.

By the second half of 2011, Annie began working on The Night Within Us!, an EP that was slated for an early 2012 release. The Skatebård-produced title track and soon-to-be single [...] "The Night Within", is the theme song for an homonymous short film by Hildegunn Waerness and part of an interdisciplinary project by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard. The installation and set of paintings, exhibited on the Guido W. Baudach gallery in Berlin from 26 November 2011 to 25 February 2012, are based on the lyrics and theme of the song, which [...] "deal with love and loss", and capture [...] "the existential need for human tenderness, trust and partnership on one hand, and the painful realisation of lies, deceit and abandonment", all of which have been somewhat present on Melgaard's work. A video has been done for the song, based almost entirely on the exhibition.|$|E

2500|$|Very {{little is}} known about how bath salts {{interact}} with the brain and how they are metabolised by the body. Scientists are inclined to believe that bath salts have a powerful addictive potential and can increase users' tolerance. They are similar to amphetamines in that they cause stimulant effects by increasing the concentration of monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in synapses. under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, but other <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> such as naphyrone appeared soon after and some products described as legal contained illegal compounds. To avoid being controlled by the Medicines Act, <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> such as mephedrone have been described as [...] "bath salts", or other misnomers such as [...] "plant food" [...] despite the compounds having no history of being used for these purposes.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bath salts" [...] (also called [...] "psychoactive bath salts" [...] or [...] "PABS") is a {{term used}} in North America and Europe to {{describe}} a number of recreational <b>designer</b> <b>drugs.</b> The name derives from instances in which the drugs were sold disguised as true bath salts. The white powder, granules, or crystals often resemble true bath salts such as Epsom salts, but are very different chemically. The drug's packaging often states [...] "not for human consumption" [...] {{in an attempt to}} circumvent drug prohibition laws. Bath salts have also been similarly disguised as plant food, hookah cleaner, and other products.|$|E

2500|$|Synthetic cathinones such as mephedrone, {{which are}} {{chemically}} similar to cathinone, naturally {{found in the}} plant Catha edulis (khat), were first synthesised in the 1920s. They remained obscure until {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, when underground chemists rediscovered them and began to use them in <b>designer</b> <b>drugs,</b> as the compounds were legal in many jurisdictions. In 2009 and 2010 there was a significant rise in the abuse of synthetic cathinones, initially in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, and subsequently in the United States. Drugs marketed as [...] "bath salts" [...] first came to the attention of authorities in the US in 2010 after reports were made to US poison centers. In Europe, the drugs were predominantly purchased from websites, but in the US they were mainly sold in small independent stores such as gas stations and head shops. In the US, this often made them easier to obtain than cigarettes and alcohol. [...] Bath salts have also been sold online in small packets.|$|E
