50|$|Condor {{agrees with}} Col. Fargo's {{plan to move}} forward with a SLBM and bomber attack. Harpoon disagrees and {{attempts}} to hide his nuclear authentication codes, but they are forcibly taken by Col. Fargo. Fargo and Condor contact Alice, giving the authentication codes and ordering him to <b>execute</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the attack plan. Alice advises against this course of action, but obeys his orders and begins to organize the bombers for the attack.|$|R
50|$|Stone {{surrendered}} {{after he}} was promised mercy. Following hostilities, however, the war council issued death sentences for Stone and nine others. Four of the prisoners were <b>executed,</b> but the <b>remainder</b> were saved when the women of Providence begged that their lives be spared.|$|R
25|$|The Regiment {{continued}} on duty at Trenton till 12 November 1862, when Colonel Rinaker {{was ordered to}} take {{the right wing of}} the Regiment, companies A, D, and F, and proceed to Humboldt, Tennessee, and relieve the Eighty-first Illinois Infantry, and to take command of the post and troops remaining there, consisting of four companies: Fifty-fourth Illinois Infantry, a part of Fourth Illinois Cavalry, Seventh Wisconsin Battery. This order was at once <b>executed.</b> The <b>remainder</b> of the Regiment was left at Trenton under command of Lieutenant Colonel J. F. Drish.|$|R

It is not known if any members of the Inca royal family survived this final purge. Amaru's body parts were strewn across the towns loyal to him as ordered, his houses were demolished, their sites strewn with salt, his goods confiscated, his relatives declared infamous, and all documents relating to his descent burnt.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of Sophia Alekseyevna in 1689, the {{government}} of Peter the Great engaged {{in a process of}} gradual limitation of the streltsy’s military and political influence. In order to counter their power Peter began to raise a new regular army, still armed with muskets but disciplined, uniformed and organised along West European lines. In spite of these measures, the streltsy revolted yet again while Peter was on his Great Embassy in Europe. The four regiments involved were disbanded and 1,200 of the mutineers were <b>executed.</b> The <b>remainder</b> were exiled, had their property confiscated and were banned from future military employment. The entire corps was technically abolished in 1689; however, after having suffered a defeat at Narva in 1700, the government retained some streltsy units in service.|$|R

5000|$|The MSZDP {{made their}} peace with Miklós Horthy's {{government}} in 1921 with the Bethlen-Peyer pact. More radical elements were suppressed, and {{trade union activity}} was increasingly driven underground during the 1930s. After 1939, the party {{became known as the}} SZDP, dropping the [...] "Magyarországi" [...] moniker. The environment became increasingly hostile during the Second World War and activity virtually drained to a halt. With the Nazi takeover of Hungary in 1944, the party was declared illegal. Many of the leadership were <b>executed,</b> with the <b>remainder</b> imprisoned or driven underground.|$|R
50|$|Felipillo was {{the leader}} of a sixteenth-century maroon band in Panama. Felipillo was a Spanish {{speaking}} (Ladino) slave who managed a boat for the pearl fisheries on the Pearl Islands on Panama's Pacific side. In 1549, he led a revolt in which slaves fled the islands as well as cattle ranches on the mainland, and then fled into the mountains. From their base Felipillo and his followers raided Spanish ranches and travelers until 1551 when he and 30 of his followers were surprised and captured by Captain Francisco Carreño. Felipillo was subsequently <b>executed</b> and the <b>remainder</b> of his followers sold as slaves.|$|R

At the Yalta Conference, the British committed themselves to return Soviet citizens to the Soviet Union. After consulation with Harold Macmillan Keightley proceeded to hand over these prisoners and their families regardless of their nationality, including people with French, German, Yugoslav, or Nansen passports. The prisoners were delivered by deceit and force to SMERSH at Judenburg; many were <b>executed</b> immediately, the <b>remainder</b> sent to the Gulag.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the civilians killed by German troops on 22 August at Tintigny, a further group was taken prisoner and interrogated by a German officer who afterwards had forty of the men shot. [...] Another group of civilians were marched towards Rossignol, where, upon hearing the sound of gunfire, four were <b>executed,</b> the <b>remainder</b> were taken back to Tintigny and used as human shields against French artillery fire on 23 August. [...] In all 63 of the inhabitants of Tintigny {{were killed by the}} German forces and the hamlet itself almost completely destroyed. [...] Subsequent to the battle the rumour spread around German troops that the French at Rossignol had been assisted by civilians. [...] In {{addition to}} those executed by German courts-martial at nearby Arlon, 122 civilians (108 of which were from Rossignol) were accused of involvement and executed on the orders of Colonel Richard Karl von Tessmar by telephone from Luxembourg. [...] Two francs-tireurs captured at Les Bulles by the 157th Infantry Regiment on 23 August were shot.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Kiwi system {{achieves}} co-design {{by allowing}} nominated regions of C # programs to be targeted at FPGAs while the <b>remainder</b> <b>executes</b> on unmodified.

Using C # attributes, certain methods are identified for separate compilation and collections of methods are mapped to multiple FPGAs or to workstations {{connected to a}} common Ethernet switch. Individual methods become RPC-callable entities for the top-level C # thread running on one workstation, while server threads may run continually on other workstations or FPGAs. We illustrate the concept using minimal modifications to an Adobe Photoshop plug-in where the processing for each colour channel is farmed over the Ethernet to one or three remote entities which may each be either an FPGA or a workstation.

25|$|Markets and fairs were a {{key element}} in the town's economy in medieval times. The Market Square came to {{prominence}} in 1235 when Henry III ordered that the selling of goods in the churchyard of All Saint's should be relocated to the Market Square. Street names in the town give an indication of trades and market centres; Corn Hill, Malt Hill, Mercer Row, Gold Street, Sheep Street and Horse Market. Cloth and wool were very important but these industries declined. In the 13th century, Northampton had a large Jewish population centred on Gold Street. In 1277two years after Edward I passed the Statute of the Jewrysome Jewish residents were <b>executed</b> while the <b>remainder</b> were driven out of town. Archaeological sites include a medieval Jewish cemetery and the Northampton Medieval Synagogue.|$|R
30|$|We {{envisage}} our cell-based broad-phase microarchitectures fabricated {{as part of}} an IC {{that would}} also <b>execute</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the interactive application program loop. Using a single platform would allow for the elimination of data transfer overheads. This concept has been successfully adopted to integrate a CPU and GPU within some Intel Core processors [42] as well as AMD accelerated processing units (APUs) [43], such as those in the PlayStation 4. Within the spectrum of platforms readily available today, our microarchitectures could naturally reside within the fixed-function logic of GPUs, as there is already a significant focus on relocating many elements of the interactive application program loop to these platforms [44]. The remainder of the program loop could utilise the programmable elements of the GPU. Adding one of the microarchitectures would not compromise GPU programmability, as all GPUs include some fixed-function logic such as rasterisation. This is unlikely to change due to power-density limits as well as the lacklustre throughput achieved when traditionally fixed-function elements have been reimplemented using the programmable elements of a GPU [45]. Moreover, it is not prohibitively expensive to include one of the microarchitectures, as the large production volumes of commodity platforms amortises the cost [27]. Therefore, there exists sufficient motivation for the fabrication of our logic as part of a future GPU.|$|R
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 545 Allied airmen who were {{captured in the}} Japanese home islands (excluding the Kuril and Bonin Islands), 132 were executed and 29 were killed by civilians. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately left in a prison in Tokyo during the 25/26May raid on the city. Between six and eight US airmen shot down on 5May were subjected to vivisection at the Kyushu Imperial University; Professor Fukujirō Ishiyama and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel {{responsible for the deaths}} of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials following the war. Several of those found guilty were <b>executed</b> and the <b>remainder</b> were imprisoned.|$|R
500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} agricultural production, the kolkhozes (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. Kolkhoz leaders used this {{as an excuse to}} expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly 12,000people were sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin. He also worked to impose collectivization on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process. The partisans, many of whom fought as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 [...] "bandits" [...] and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946. About 600,000Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third <b>executed</b> and the <b>remainder</b> imprisoned or exiled to the east.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Crawford's {{business}} {{had been to}} declare himself the lover of Fanny, make decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle, who seemed {{to stand in the}} place of her parents; and he had done it all so well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas, feeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his niece's mind, conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself. He talked, therefore, for several minutes without Fanny's daring to interrupt him. She had hardly even attained the wish to do it. Her mind was in too much confusion. She had changed her position; and, with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows, was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a moment he ceased, but she had barely become conscious of it, when, rising from his chair, he said, [...] "And now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission, and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory, I may <b>execute</b> the <b>remainder</b> by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself, I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to.

50|$|On May 5, 1945, an American B-29 bomber {{was flying}} {{with a dozen}} other {{aircraft}} after bombing Tachiaral Air Base in southwestern Japan, beginning the return flight to Guam. Kinzou Kasuya, a 19-year-old Japanese pilot flying one of the Japanese fighters {{in pursuit of the}} Americans, rammed his aircraft into the fuselage of the B-29, destroying both planes. No one knows for certain how many Americans were in the B-29 as its crew had been hastily assembled on Guam. Villagers in Japan who witnessed the collision in the air saw about a dozen parachutes blossom. One of the Americans died when the cords of his parachute were severed by another Japanese plane. A second was alive when he reached the ground. He shot all but his last bullet at the villagers coming toward him, then used the last on himself. The other nine B-29 airmen who were captured by the Japanese after landing were subjected to vivisection at the Kyushu Imperial University. Professor Ishiyama Fukujirō and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early-June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations.

500|$|The {{leaders of}} the Gaelic kindreds {{in the north and}} west were summoned by James ostensibly to a sitting of {{parliament}} in Inverness. Of those assembled the king arrested around 50 of them including Alexander, the third Lord of the Isles, and his mother, Mariota, Countess of Ross, around 24 August. A few were <b>executed</b> but the <b>remainder,</b> with the exception of Alexander and his mother, quickly released. During Alexander's captivity James attempted to split Clann Dòmhnall—Alexander's uncle John Mór was approached by an agent of the king to take the clan leadership but his refusal to have any dealings with the king while his nephew was held prisoner led to John Mór's attempted arrest and death. [...] The king's need for allies in the west and north led him to soften his approach towards the Lord of the Isles and, hoping that Alexander would now become a loyal servant of the crown, he was given his freedom. Alexander, probably under pressure from his close kinsmen Donald Balloch, John Mór's son, and Alasdair Carrach of Lochaber, led a rebellion attacking the castle and burgh of Inverness in spring 1429. The crisis deepened when a fleet from the Lordship was dispatched to bring James the Fat back from Ulster 'to convey him home that he might be king'. With James's intention to form an alliance with the Ulster O'Donnells of Tyreconnell against the MacDonalds, the English became distrustful of the Scottish king's motives and they themselves tried to bring James the Fat to England. Before he could become an active player, James the Fat died suddenly releasing James to prepare for decisive action against the Lordship.|$|R
40|$|Robots {{can act as}} proxies {{for human}} {{operators}} in environments where a human operator is not present or cannot directly perform a task, such as in dangerous or remote situations. Teleoperation is a common interface for controlling robots {{that are designed to}} be human proxies. Unfortunately, teleoperation may fail to preserve the natural fluidity of human motions due to interface limitations such as communication delays, non-immersive sensing, and controller uncertainty. I envision a robot that can learn a set of motions that a teleoperator commonly performs, so that it can autonomously execute routine tasks or recognize a user's motion in real time. Tasks can be either primitive activities or compound plans. During online operation, the robot can recognize a user's teleoperated motions on the fly and offer real-time assistance, for example, by autonomously <b>executing</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the task. I realize this vision by addressing three main problems: (1) learning primitive activities by identifying significant features of the example motions and generalizing the behaviors from user demonstration trajectories; (2) recognizing activities in real time by determining the likelihood that a user is currently executing one of several learned activities; and (3) learning complex plans by generalizing a sequence of activities, through auto-segmentation and incremental learning of previously unknown activities. To solve these problems, I first present an approach to learning activities from human demonstration that (1) provides flexibility and robustness when encoding a user's demonstrated motions by using a novel representation called a probabilistic flow tube, and (2) automatically determines the relevant features of a motion {{so that they can be}} preserved during autonomous execution in new situations. I next introduce an approach to real-time motion recognition that (1) uses temporal information to successfully model motions that may be non-Markovian, (2) provides fast real-time recognition of motions in progress by using an incremental temporal alignment approach, and (3) leverages the probabilistic flow tube representation to ensure robustness during recognition against varying environment states. Finally, I develop an approach to learn combinations of activities that (1) automatically determines where activities should be segmented in a sequence and (2) learns previously unknown activities on the fly. I demonstrate the results of autonomously executing motions learned by my approach on two different robotic platforms supporting user-teleoperated manipulation tasks in a variety of environments. I also present the results of real-time recognition in different scenarios, including a robotic hardware platform. Systematic testing in a two-dimensional environment shows up to a 27 % improvement in activity recognition rates over prior art, while maintaining average computing times for incremental recognition of less than half of human reaction time. by Shuonan Dong.
