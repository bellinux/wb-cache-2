5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've <b>got</b> <b>only</b> 18 percent of the electorate. They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E

5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you <b>got</b> <b>only</b> one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders <b>got</b> <b>only</b> two or three days' notice.|$|E

5|$|Dougan {{stood as}} an {{independent}} 'Former Captain NI Football Team' candidate for the East Belfast constituency in the 1997 UK general election, but <b>got</b> <b>only</b> 541 votes and finished seventh out of the nine candidates. In April 2000, he was cleared of aggravated burglary following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court; the incident had been alleged {{to have taken place}} at the home of Patricia Thompson, a former lover. He was also cleared of assaulting a Vietnam War veteran with a pool cue, who had been at the home with Patricia Thompson {{at the time of the}} alleged burglary incident. In another court case, again in April 2000, Dougan failed to attend a hearing where he had been charged with driving carelessly and failing to comply with a red traffic signal; he said he had been unable to attend because he had a dental appointment.|$|E
5|$|President Carlos Menem {{sought a}} {{constitutional}} amendment to allow his re-election, and Alfonsín opposed it. The victory in the 1993 midterm elections strengthened the PJ, which approved the bill in the Senate. Menem proposed a referendum on the amendment, to force the radical deputies to support it. He also proposed a bill for a law that would allow {{a constitutional amendment}} with a simple majority of the Congress. As a result, Alfonsín made the Pact of Olivos with him. With this agreement, the UCR would support Menem's proposal, but with further amendments that would reduce presidential power. The Council of Magistrates of the Nation reduced the influence of the executive power over the judiciary, the city of Buenos Aires would become an autonomous territory allowed to elect its own mayor, and the presidential term of office would be reduced to four years. The presidential elections would include the two-round system, and the electoral college would be abolished. Alfonsín was elected to the constituent assembly that worked for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. A faction of the UCR, led by Fernando delaRúa, opposed the pact, but the party as a whole supported Alfonsín. The UCR <b>got</b> <b>only</b> 19% of the vote in the elections, attaining third position in the 1995 presidential elections behind the Frepaso, when Menem was re-elected. Alfonsín resigned the presidency of the party in that year.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} loss in World War II was the deportation of the 1221 Jewish citizens to Auschwitz. The city was {{freed from the}} Nazis by the Red Army on March 28, 1945.

25|$|Although the United Russia {{became the}} leading party in each region, in {{different}} regions of the Russian Federation, election results vary considerably. While in metropolitan areas of Moscow and Saint Petersburg with 50-55% turnout United Russia <b>got</b> <b>only</b> about 50% of the votes, the national republics, especially in North Caucasus, provided much stronger voter turnout and support for the ruling party.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the {{opposition}} now had 250 votes, just {{one over the}} 249 needed to oust Brandt. To everyone's surprise, the motion failed: Barzel <b>got</b> <b>only</b> 247 votes out of 260 ballots. There were also 10 votes against the motion and three invalid ballots. Most SPD and FDP deputies did not {{take part in the}} voting, as not voting had the same effect as voting for Brandt.|$|E

25|$|Although Bunker was {{eventually}} released, he continued {{a life of}} crime. In the early 1970s, Bunker ran a profitable drug racket in San Francisco; he was arrested again when the police, who had put a tracking device on his car, followed him to a bank heist. (The police expected Bunker to lead them to a drug deal and were rather shocked by their stroke of luck.) Bunker expected a 20-year sentence, {{but thanks to the}} solicitations of influential friends and a lenient judge, he <b>got</b> <b>only</b> five years.|$|E
25|$|Underhill {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to escape from}} the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and finally succeeded on July 14, 1931. Twelve days later, Underhill purchased a car in Cherryvale, Kansas under the name Ralph Carraway and robbed a local theater of $300 that same day. The following month he recruited his young nephew, Frank Underhill, to join him on a new crime spree. On August 12, they robbed a Wichita gas station but <b>got</b> <b>only</b> $14.68. While leaving the scene of the robbery, Underhill crashed into another car and had to have it towed to a nearby garage and checked into a hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} {{of troops in}} the front line on a forward slope guaranteed that it would face the bulk of an artillery bombardment, directed by ground observers, on clearly marked lines. Digging and wiring of a new third line began in May, civilians were moved away and stocks of ammunition and hand-grenades were increased in the front-line. By mid-June Below and Rupprecht expected {{an attack on the}} 2nd Army which held the front from Noyon to beyond Gommecourt, although Falkenhayn was more concerned about an offensive in Alsace-Lorraine and then a possible attack on the 6th Army, which held the front from near Gommecourt to St. Eloi close to Ypres. In April, Falkenhayn had suggested a spoiling attack by the 6th Army but lack of troops and artillery engaged in the offensive at Verdun, made it impractical. Some labour battalions and captured Russian heavy artillery were sent to the 2nd Army, Below proposed a preventive attack in May and a reduced operation from Ovillers to St. Pierre Divion in June but <b>got</b> <b>only</b> one extra artillery regiment. On 6 June, Below reported that air reconnaissance indicated an offensive at Fricourt and Gommecourt.|$|E
