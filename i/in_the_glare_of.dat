5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes {{because it is so}} close to Neptune that it is lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E

The target was located at either a foveal or a peripheral (10 ° right) location, glare was adjacent to the foveal location, simulating the headlamps of an oncoming vehicle, and extraneous light sources were at either foveal or peripheral (10 ° right or left) locations. Contrast threshold for a foveal target without glare was affected mainly by the surrounding local luminance distribution. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>glare</b> and also for the peripheral target (both with and without <b>glare)</b> <b>the</b> global luminance distribution matters. <b>Glare</b> increased <b>the</b> contrast needed for detection of the foveal target, but this effect was reduced {{by the presence of}} extraneous light sources that were peripheral to the target.

40|$|The 2004 Greek {{election}} {{provides an}} interesting case study for examining {{the impact of}} party leaders on the vote. A change in governing party leadership {{a few months before}} polling day had two important implications.

Regarding the first question, the findings indicate that even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most favourable environment the impact of leadership evaluations on the overall electoral outcome is only slight. Regarding the second, it seems that the change of leader at the start of an election campaign can be a mixed blessing.

How should they get the best out of players with different strengths, how do you achieve the best recruitment, development, retention of these staff and when do you decide against trying to stop them from leaving? How do you motivate those who are not in your starting line up? What is your role as leader in this type of situation, how do you think longer term when the pressures are all judged by short-term measures?
