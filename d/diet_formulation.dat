Apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, pearl millet, oat groats, sorghum, and soybean meal {{was measured in}} barrows using the difference method of <b>diet</b> <b>formulation.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} difference method of <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> represents a viable application for assessing amino acid digestibility of feedstuffs in pigs. True digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and wheat by-products (bakery meal, red dog, wheat middlings) used in duck <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> was assessed. Cecectomized and intact ducks were subjected to precision feeding and collection methodologies to evaluate the influence of hindgut microflora on nutrient digestibility. The results suggest that variation in amino acid digestibility between cecectomized and intact ducks is considerable for low-protein ingredients, but differences in digestibility are less pronounced with higher amino acid intakes. Similar precision feeding and collection methodologies were employed to characterize the metabolizable energy (ME) of several cereal grains (corn, barley, pearl millet, sorghum, triticale). The study demonstrated the potential utility of pearl millet and sorghum in feed formulation for ducks based on comparable ME to corn. Some agricultural wastes are characterized by high nitrogen {{and phosphorus}} contents. Swine and duck nutrient balance assays were employed to evaluate co-products from a pork processing plant and a commercial microbial fermentation unit. The fermentation co-product was observed to have no feeding value due to poor ability to support nitrogen retention in pigs and ducks. Antinutritional compounds restrict the use of certain ingredients in <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> by exerting negative effects on nutrient availability. The effect of new xylanase and phytase preparations on performance of young pigs was investigated. Xylanase in a corn-soybean meal diet failed to influence pig performance, but improvements in growth and feed efficiency were effected by phytase addition to diets. In conclusion, incorporation of nutrient digestibility and exogenous enzyme research findings in commercial <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> will aid efforts to reduce the negative environmental impact of animal production. ...|$|E

Three groups of 12 pigs were fed a standard corn–soybean meal diet over a 13 -wk period. Urine and feces were collected at each feeding and transferred to 12 manure storage tanks. Manure chemical characteristics and headspace gas concentrations were monitored for NH 3, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), volatile fatty acids, phenols, and indoles. Microbial analysis of the stored manure included plate counts, community structure (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis), and metabolic function (Biolog). All odorants in manure and headspace gas concentrations were significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) correlated for length of storage using quadratic equations, peaking after Week 5 for all headspace gases and most manure chemical characteristics.

The United States is a global leader in pig production, and the United States swine industry is centered in Iowa. Feed is the largest individual input in pig production, but the energy consumption of the Iowa swine feed production chain has yet to be critically examined. This analysis examines nonsolar energy use and resulting 100 -yr global warming potential (GWP) associated with the swine feed production chain, beginning with cultivation of crops and concluding with <b>diet</b> <b>formulation.</b> The nonsolar energy use and accompanying 100 -yr GWP associated with production of 13 common swine feed ingredients are estimated. Two <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> strategies are considered for 4 crop sequence × ingredient choice combinations to generate 8 crop sequence × <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> scenarios. The first formulation strategy (simple) does not include synthetic AA or phytase. The second strategy (complex) reduces CP content of the diet by using L-lysine to meet standardized ileal digestibility lysine requirements of pigs and includes the exogenous enzyme phytase. Regardless of crop sequence × <b>diet</b> <b>formulation</b> scenario, including the enzyme phytase is energetically favorable and reduces the potential excretion of P by reducing or removing inorganic P from the complete diet. Including L-lysine reduces the CP content of the diet and requires less nonsolar energy to deliver adequate standardized ileal digestible lysine than simply feeding soybean meal. Replacing soybean meal with full-fat soybeans is not energetically beneficial under Iowa conditions. Swine diets including dried distillers grains with solubles and crude glycerol require approximately 50 % more nonsolar energy inputs than corn-soybean meal diets or corn-soybean meal diets including oats.

The sterile insect technique (SIT) {{is being developed}} as a sustainable approach to management of Q-fly. New larval diets are needed for economical production of millions of artificially reared sterile flies that are required for use in SIT. Solid diets that incorporate biological bulking agents present problems of variable quality and waste disposal. Liquid diets emerged as a promising alternative, but these also suffer drawbacks, including separation of components, fermentation and need for cleaning and regular replacement of substrates that support developing larvae. The present study considers whether two promising liquid <b>diet</b> <b>formulations</b> might be improved by incorporating agar (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 %) to create semiliquid or gel diets that maintain consistent composition, suppress fermentation, negate the need for supporting substrates and minimize waste.
