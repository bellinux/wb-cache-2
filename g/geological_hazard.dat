40|$|We {{live in a}} {{constantly}} changing environment, characterized by climate changes, extreme weather events and the occurrence of more frequent <b>geological</b> <b>hazards</b> that have a strong {{negative impact on the}} territory and society, interrupting services, damaging buildings and infrastructure and jeopardizing the life of millions of people worldwide. For this reason, there is the need to build a society resilient to natural-hazards, which can understand how the natural system behaves and responds to natural and human-induced modifications and can adapt to these changes. The monitoring of the territory is necessary to comprehend the triggering factors and the mechanisms of <b>geological</b> <b>hazards</b> and to plan the most suitable actions to prevent and mitigate the risk. The monitoring of <b>geological</b> <b>hazards</b> with conventional ground-based techniques such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and levelling is usually expensive and time consuming, which limits the number of measured points and the overall duration of the surveys. One of the best way to overcome to these problems is to use remote-sensing techniques to monitor large portion of territory reducing operating costs and time. Advanced Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (A-DInSAR) {{is one of the best}} tool to monitor and study ground displacements over very large portions of territory in a cost-effective way. In this Doctoral Thesis, we applied A-DInSAR to the monitoring of the geological instabilities occurring in different areas characterized by unique geological and environmental features. The selected areas include different environments such as vegetate territories, low and steep topography, coastal areas, salty deserts, urbanized land, each of them affected by hazards of natural and anthropic origin such as landslides, subsidence and karstic activity. In each case study, the monitoring activity presented its own challenges that were overcome adopting specific technical solutions in the data processing and management. The aim of this work is to give an overview of the potential of A-DInSAR techniques when applied to the study of <b>geological</b> <b>hazards</b> in different environments. This can be useful to show to local Authorities that A-DInSAR can be fully integrated as part of the activities carried out to manage the territory and to prevent and mitigate the risk related to <b>geological</b> <b>hazards...</b>|$|R

2500|$|On 26 October {{the head}} of the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and <b>Geological</b> <b>Hazard</b> Mitigation, Surono, {{repeated}} his earlier statements that the greatest concern was the pressure building behind a massive lava dome that has formed near the tip of the crater. [...] "The energy is building up. ... We hope it will release slowly," [...] he said. [...] "Otherwise we're looking at a potentially huge eruption, bigger than anything we've seen in years". Surono also said that said the distension of the mountain's slopes was much more rapid this time around, indicating a higher-pressure build-up of gas and hence a much more explosive eruption and speculated that Merapi may erupt explosively, as it did in 1930, and not just eject gas as in 2006 eruptions.|$|E

2500|$|The Center for Volcanology and <b>Geological</b> <b>Hazard</b> Mitigation {{observation}} outposts at Mount Merapi began observing at 00:00 {{and concluded}} at 06:00 and reported no significant visible activity. Merapi spewed hot {{clouds in the}} afternoon. Sulfatara smoke was visible from several posts and avalanches were observed. Mount Merapi erupted at 10:10 local time Monday morning spewing hot clouds and dark fog masses in easterly direction punctuated by loud explosions. Lt Col Soekoso Wahyudi, chief of the Boyolali district military command, was reported by Antara news as saying the explosions this time were louder than those of Sunday evening 31 October. The hot clouds descended on part of the mountain slopes and moved in easterly direction. Local military and police commands deployed personnel on roads in areas around the mountain to regulate traffic which had become clogged by vehicles and people rushing to leave the danger zones. Reports from Klaten, Sleman and Boyolali districts suggested the volcanic explosions were so loud they caused panic and a rush to seek refuge. Merapi's heat and hot ash clouds continued to erupt throughout the day. A thick eruptive ash cloud was reported to rise [...] into the air. The Darwin VAAC reported that a possible eruption on 1 November produced an ash plume that rose to an altitude of [...] a.s.l., according to ground-based reports, analyses of satellite imagery, and web camera views. The WHO reported that Mount Merapi spewed out hot clouds of gas and ash again on Monday morning, 1 November 2010 at around 10:05 local time. Clouds of hot ash and gas billowed up to [...] into the atmosphere, before cascading back down up to [...] around the slopes of Merapi. An uninterrupted stream of smoke clouds were sent into the air for 40 minutes, heading southward toward a nearby river in Sleman regency, and took with it an estimated 2million cubic metres of rock and earth from the peak.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Geological</b> <b>hazards</b> {{especially}} for the dynamic disasters are proven {{to be the most}} difficult problems encountered in the deep underground projects. This paper attempts to deal with the geological problem faced by Shizhuyuan multi-ploy metallic mine base on the results of mechanics tests and numerical simulation. In order to understand the mechanism dynamic disasters, a new energy index, the Local Energy Release Rate (LERR), is put forward in the simulating process. By tracking the peak and valley values of elastic strain energy intensity before and after brittle failure, the LERR is set as an index to ascertain the scope of the high dangerous region. The results showed that LERR can satisfactorily predict the dangerous region, and it will be more accurate with some necessary monitoring method. The study indicates the potential of LERR for evaluating <b>geological</b> <b>hazards</b> in deep underground excavations...|$|R
