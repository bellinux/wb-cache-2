500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I think if you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.|$|E

40|$|Papal {{letters were}} issued for the {{specific}} purpose of authorizing and encouraging the Albigensian crusade; their purpose was never to inform the reader or listener {{about the nature of}} Cathar beliefs or their origins.

In order to find detailed information on what this prominent group of heretics, popularly called 'Cathars', did and did not believe, who they were and where their beliefs and practices originated, we must look for answers not in papal documents but in other primary sources from the period...|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{before these}} events, in 1908, {{he went to}} Istanbul and, very certainly, met there with the sultan's brother Rachîd or the sultan Abdûl-Hamid himself. On the other hand, he {{returned}} several times to Paris and met with his brother Rachîd Moutran, obviously constructing political connections between certain groups of the Young Turks and the conservative groups around the sultan. During his financial difficulties, {{in the beginning of}} 1907, he also became the object of false accusations and calumny by the French actress Mme Carlier. Perhaps, this was part of a political intrigue against him, because he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the Young Turks movement.|$|R

60|$|The skipper {{followed}} his host {{into the little}} bungalow and sat down heavily in the chair which the other motioned him to take. While Neilson went out to fetch whisky and glasses he took a look round the room. It filled him with amazement. He had {{never seen so many}} books. The shelves reached from floor to ceiling on all four walls, and they were closely packed. There was a grand piano littered with music, and a large table on which books and magazines lay in disorder. The room made him feel embarrassed. He remembered that Neilson was a queer fellow. No one <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> him, although {{he had been in the}} islands for so many years, but those who knew him agreed that he was queer. He was a Swede.|$|R

2500|$|The series' main {{characters}} {{live in a}} blended family, a premise the creators considered underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining the family background [...] "not important to the kids' lives. They are a great blended family and that's {{all we need to}} know." [...] The choice of a platypus as the boys' pet was similarly inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance. The platypus also gives them freedom to [...] "make stuff up" [...] since [...] "no one <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them." [...] An additional reason for choosing a platypus allowed them to own that [...] "mental real estate", so that if a person thinks [...] "platypus", they'll associate it with [...] "Agent P", just as an ogre is now commonly associated with Shrek.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the doctor}} has taken a blood sample Hancock blithely assumes that that {{is all that is}} needed and prepares to depart. When the doctor tells him it was only a smear and that he must donate a pint of blood, he protests, [...] "I don't mind giving a {{reasonable}} amount, but a pint! That's very nearly an armful!" [...] The doctor finally persuades Hancock to donate the full pint by telling him he has a rare blood type, which appeals to Hancock's snobbery. Having boasted of his lack of squeamishness, he faints while giving blood. Recuperating afterwards, Hancock has a chat about blood with a fellow patient (Lloyd), but since neither of them <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> blood the conversation is not very informative. As he prepares to leave Hancock is horrified to discover that the other patient has stolen his wine gums. ("If you can't trust a blood donor, who can you trust?") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've been crying," [...] remarked Josie, with {{aggravating}} pity. [...] "I suppose you're homesick--some {{people have}} so little self-control in that respect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so long. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem ALL red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable around, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla'd load you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd {{have gone to the}} park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards same place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was.

50|$|Although Ina {{was listed}} as Society Editor, Chronicle-News in the Trinidad, Colorado City Directory of 1907, she also {{reported}} on sports, particularly baseball, and was named sporting editor of the paper in 1906. At the time, Trinidad was a thriving mining town and attending a baseball game was a popular pastime for the populace of ~10,000. None of the reporters at The Chronicle-News <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> baseball or how to keep a box score but Ina was an expert because she had played baseball and learned all about the game from her little brother Robert. Thus, Ina became the paper's baseball reporter and her box scores were judged to be perfect. Alfred Damon Runyon, who himself had been the sporting editor of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado tried to establish a professional baseball league in Colorado in 1907 by attracting talented amateurs {{from around the country}} to play against some of the established teams in the state. Over Labor Day weekend in 1907, an All Star team from Denver consisting of at least two players from Chicago, Illinois, played a three-game series against Trinidad's baseball team. 1500 people (~15% of the town) attended the final game. In the photograph to the right taken before the final game on Labor Day, it is believed that Ina Eloise Young is sitting {{in the center of the}} front row, above the white dog, with her mother and father seated on her left. This was a good location to keep a box score and report on the game. Although there is no byline, Ina Eloise Young, as sporting editor, certainly wrote the article that appeared in The Chronicle-News on September 3, 1907 about this three-game series. Damon Runyon is possibly standing on the far left with the other dignitaries in the front-center of the photograph. This event illustrates the popularity of baseball in Colorado at the time and shows Ina Eloise Young and Damon Runyon right in the middle of it.|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} so few people either <b>know</b> or care <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> New Zealand may {{occasion}} same passing regret and even a little frustration among its inhabitants. But {{it is not the}} national obsession that some make it out to be. Recent efforts to exploit interest in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, filmed in New Zealand, do not simply reflect the understandable, if pathological, desire of a small island nation to be noticed. They have rather {{more to do with the}} hard-headed hope that Frodo and friends will further boost the tourism that plays an increasingly important role in an export sector still dangerously dependent on primary production. Likewise, the attention paid to the America's Cup (a regular gathering of rich men messing about in expensive boats) has as much to do with bringing dollars into downtown Auckland and its super-yacht industry as with the desire to show the world a thing or two in spite of the decline of the once-dominant All Blacks...|$|R

[...] "I want you to try and realise, father, if you can, that I have passed into a larger world than you or this little village {{community}} here <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b> I have written books and been praised for them by men whose praise is worth having.

6000|$|... "From {{the looks}} of {{the place where they}} stayed last night, I should say that they don't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> camping out," [...] {{continued}} Bob. [...] "They just hitched the horses to a tree, and laid down on the ground, with a few boughs under them, instead of putting up a shelter, which wouldn't have taken ten minutes. I found pieces of newspaper, in which had been food, scattered around. So I fancy their arrangements for the journey were made very hurriedly and incompletely. I don't think they had hay or grain for the horses, for I couldn't find any signs of either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose that}} they <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, Harry. He comes off and on, {{generally}} arriving at night, and leaving {{a few hours}} afterwards. I hear about these things because everyone knows that old Peter Langley is not the chap to put his nose into other people's business. I don't like these goings on, I must say, and consider they will end badly. However, it is no business of ours, lad. We get our brandy cheap in Hayling--nowhere cheaper, I should say--and that, after all, is the matter that concerns us most. The wind's rising fast; I think we're in for a gale." ...|$|E
60|$|I do not <b>know</b> {{anything}} <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{the movements}} in America that {{aim at the}} improvement of the public health and at the removal of public ignorance upon vital things. In Britain {{we have a number of}} powerful organizations active in disseminating knowledge to counteract the spread of this or that infectious or contagious disease. The War has made us in Europe much more outspoken and fearless in dealing with lurking hideous evils. We believe much more than we did in the curative value of light and knowledge. And we have a very considerable literature of books on--what shall I call it? on Sex Wisdom, which aim to prevent some of that great volume of misery, deprivation and nervous disease due to the prevailing ignorance and secrecy in these matters. For in these matters great multitudes of modern people still live in an ignorance that would have been inconceivable to an ancient Hebrew. In England now the books of such a writer as Dr. Marie Stopes are enormously read, and--though they are by no means perfect works--do much to mitigate the hidden disappointments, discontents, stresses and cruelties of married life. Now I believe that it would be possible to compile a modern Leviticus and Deuteronomy to tell our whole modern community decently and plainly--just as plainly as the old Hebrew Bible instructed its Hebrew population--what was to be known and what had to be done, and what had not to be done in these intimate matters.|$|R
40|$|One of the less-anticipated {{outcomes}} {{from the}} past decade of genomics is how poorly the complexity of organisms correlates with their gene number. Even allowing for a large measure of anthropocentrism, it remains puzzling that humans have only about 20, 800 protein-coding genes, whereas water fleas have about 30, 900 and the rice plant has 40, 000 or so. Working with this pedestrian number of genes, the human body nonetheless gives rise to more than 400 specialised cell types (Vickaryous and Hall, 2006), and the remarkable diversity of these cell types in terms of form and function arises from different sets of genes (known as modules) being co-expressed at different times. We understand quite {{a lot about how}} genes themselves evolve and diversify, but we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> less <b>about</b> the evolution of the proc-esses that regulate the expression of genes. Are modules stable over evolutionary timescales, or are they assembled opportunistically as required? Are duplicate copies of genes retained in the ancestral module or are they reassigned to another module? And if they are reassigned, do they tend to be reassigned to the same module or to different modules, and does this happen shortly after duplication or does it continue over a much longer time? Does it matter whether the dupli-cates were generated sporadically or via whole-genome duplication? Is regulatory evolution driven by natural selection, and does it corre-late with changes in lifestyle or the copy number of chromosomes? Indeed, are there general principles of modular gene regulation, or is the story of gene regulation one of contingency and anecdote...|$|R
40|$|Perhaps to no one’s surprise, {{a recent}} survey found that most Americans know far more about {{television}} hits than they know about the United States Constitution. For instance, 52 % of Americans surveyed could name at least two characters from The Simpsons, and 41 % could name at least two judges from American Idol. Meanwhile, a mere 28 % could identify {{more than one of}} the rights protected by the First Amendment. Surveys such as this help clear up one of the apparent mysteries of the last five years: How did we change so quickly from a nation in which the rule of law seemed deeply entrenched to a nation that has seen an astonishingly successful executive power grab? The answer, is that many Americans—including those who serve in Congress—neither <b>know</b> nor care <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> our constitutional system. Although the subject of constitutional checks and balances is a matter of endless interest to {{most of the people who}} populate America’s law schools, the rule of law and the protection of constitutional rights turn out to be matters of extreme indifference to quite a few of our fellow citizens...|$|R
