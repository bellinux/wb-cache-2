40|$|The GTAP model, {{versions}} 4. 1 and lower, {{suffers from}} some defects {{in the implementation}} of the regional household <b>demand</b> <b>system.</b> Most seriously, the upper level of the <b>demand</b> <b>system</b> assumes that each regional household faces a fixed price for utility from private consumption. But with a private consumption <b>demand</b> <b>system</b> of the CDE form, the price of utility from private consumption depends on the level of private consumption expenditure. With no fixed price for utility from private consumption, the familiar Cobb-Douglas <b>demand</b> <b>system</b> does not apply. Accordingly, the upper-level demand equations are in error. Furthermore, utility and equivalent variation are wrongly computed in simulations with non-standard settings for the CDE expansion parameters. Even with the standard settings, in multi-step simulations the utility and equivalent variation computations are inexact. The welfare decomposition inherits the defects of the equivalent variation computation. In removing these defects we revise in passing some minor misfeatures of the old treatment: Firstly, we treat the entire final <b>demand</b> <b>system</b> as the <b>demand</b> <b>system</b> of a representative household, rather than a conglomeration of representative and region-wide <b>demand</b> <b>systems</b> (subsection 2. 6).
