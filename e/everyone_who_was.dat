The ship immediately started to break up and sank within five minutes. Some of those remaining aboard managed to reach a liferaft that the Chief Officer had released only minutes before.|$|E

25|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{the single}} most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the UK's version is part of National Insurance; the U.S.'s version is Social Security (SS)—specifically, several parts of SS including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are the safety net that catches <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.|$|E
25|$|The Assiniboine had {{a system}} of a Sioux Kinship. In this kinship <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> born belonged to it, but outsiders could {{become part of the}} kinship through relationships. In terms of spiritual beliefs, the band had strong ties to the spiritual world. Their {{religious}} ideas and practices formed the basis of their life. They had powerful connections with animals and natural phenomena. They believe that animals and natural phenomena had spiritual power that could be acquired for personal advantage through a vision quest. In this quest they would go to a secluded area of the forest where they would fast and pray until a spiritual guardian came to them in a dream.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{began at}} Al-Azhar {{in the month}} of Ramadan, 975. According to Syed Farid Alatas, the Jami'ah had faculties in Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic. The Fatimids gave {{attention}} to the philosophical studies at the time when rulers in other countries declared those who were engaged in philosophical pursuits as apostates and heretics. The Greek thought found a warm reception with the Fatimids who expanded the boundaries of such studies. They paid much attention to philosophy and gave support to <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> known for being engaged in the study of any branch of philosophy. The Fatimid Caliph invited many scholars from nearby countries and paid much attention to college books on various branches of knowledge and in gathering the finest writing on various subjects and this in order to encourage scholars and to uphold the cause of knowledge. These books were destroyed by Saladin.|$|E

25|$|Kristiansen's mother testified {{during the}} trial that she saw her son {{arriving}} and walking in the backyard {{on the evening of}} the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since the cell phone alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over. Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls right before the crime. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. He did not see a second man, and it's unlikely that the witness saw Kristiansen instead of Andersen since Kristansen is a short and thin while Andersen is tall and big. Despite extensive public outreach for <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. This witness, a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people that heard or saw relevant activity that did not fit the timeline created by the police were not called as witness to the court either.|$|E

As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E

[...] "The Stowaway" [...] continues the tradition of a Christmas song from [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] ("Song for Ten") and [...] "The Runaway Bride" [...] ("Love Don't Roam"). The song was influenced by Irish folk music, and contrasts the upbeat [...] "under deck" [...] feeling with melancholy lyrics about unrequited love. The episode features {{a new version of the}} theme tune during its credits, comparable to Peter Howell's version from the 1980s, which contains a new bass line, drums, and piano.|$|E

500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> present with tears in their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E

[...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened?

After killing a nobleman, he took away his {{identity}} document proving that he is Tobei Kihara, but his real name is unknown. Everyone who came to meet him told him {{over and over again that}} he should [...] "just die" [...] and [...] "go to hell". He was often abused and tortured by the townsfolk. As he grew up he learned he had to steal things, including lives, or he wouldn't survive. Eventually, he ended up going into murderous rages and killed <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in his way. He was soon caught after killing so many people and was beheaded at sixteen. Since his death, Tobei had been living in Hell for 300 years, tortured by Ose so he can [...] "repent for his sins". Tobei has tried to escape Hell numerous times, but was always caught by Ose. One day he was offered by Lady Ema that if he could collect 108 sins in 108 days then he could be free to return to the earth.
