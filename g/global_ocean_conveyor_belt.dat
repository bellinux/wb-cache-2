40|$|The western South Atlantic forms a key {{location}} in the <b>global</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> Different water masses formed in remote {{areas of the world}} extend into that area and generate a highly complex vertical stratification structure. In the upper ocean, this structure is dominated by the encounter of southward flowing Brazil Current and northward-flowing Malvinas-(Falkland) Current generating one of the most energetic regions of the world ocean; the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC). In the deep ocean, the vertical stratification structure is dominated by contributions from intermediate- and deep water masses, including the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) which represents an active player in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The western South Atlantic is thus critical in understanding global ocean-climate changes. However, a detailed insight into the past remains a significant challenge in climate research {{due to the lack of}} high temporal resolution climate archives. The presented research of this thesis focuses on the surface- and intermediate water circulation in the western South Atlantic during the Holocene with special emphasize on sedimentation processes in the Mar del Plata Canyon. Results of this research highlight the extraordinary potential of a submarine canyon for reconstructing paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic changes with high temporal resolution, and clearly demonstrate that a good knowledge of sediment transport phenomena is an indispensable precondition for understanding paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic changes, particularly in such highly energetic current regimes as the western South Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|The Argentine margin {{contains}} important sedimentological, paleontological {{and chemical}} records of {{regional and local}} tectonic evolution, sea level, climate evolution and ocean circulation since {{the opening of the}} South Atlantic in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous as well as the present-day results of post-depositional chemical and biological alteration. Despite its important location, which underlies the exchange of southern- and northern-sourced water masses, the Argentine margin has not been investigated in detail using scientific drilling techniques, perhaps because the margin has the reputation of being erosional. However, a number of papers published since 2009 have reported new high-resolution and/or multichannel seismic surveys, often combined with multi-beam bathymetric data, which show the common occurrence of layered sediments and prominent sediment drifts on the Argentine and adjacent Uruguayan margins. There has also been significant progress in studying the climatic records in surficial and near-surface sediments recovered in sediment cores from the Argentine margin. Encouraged by these recent results, our 3. 5 -day IODP (International Ocean Discovery Program) workshop in Buenos Aires (8 – 11 September 2015) focused on opportunities for scientific drilling on the Atlantic margin of Argentina, which lies beneath a key portion of the <b>global</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> of thermohaline circulation.

40|$|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of the <b>global</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> acting as a zonal link among the major ocean basins but, to some extent, limiting meridional exchange and tending to isolate the ocean south of it from momentum and heat income. In this work we investigate {{one of the most}} important mechanisms contributing to the poleward transfer of properties in the Southern Ocean, that is the eddy component of the dynamics. For this particular purpose, observations obtained from near-surface drifters have been used: they represent a very useful data set to analyse the eddy field because of their ability to catch a large number of scales of motion while providing a quasi-synoptic coverage of the investigated area. Estimates of the eddy heat and momentum fluxes are carried out using data taken from the Global Drifter Program databank; they refer to Surface Velocity Program drifter trajectories collected in the area south of 35 &#x 00 B 0;S between 1995 and 2006. Eddy kinetic energies, variance ellipses, momentum and heat fluxes have been calculated using the pseudo-Eulerian method, showing patterns in good agreement with those present in the literature based on observational and model data, although there are some quantitative differences. The eddy fluxes have been separated into their rotational and divergent portions, the latter being responsible for the meridional transports. The associated zonal and depth-exponentially integrated meridional heat transport exhibits values spanning over a range between - 0. 4 PW and &#x 2013; 1. 1 PW in the ACC region, consistent with previous estimates...|$|E

40|$|Persistent geostrophic {{currents}} {{interacting with}} sea-floor topography and available sediment sources {{are capable of}} eroding, transporting and depositing fine-grained particles into mounded and elongated sediment drifts. These drifts show enhanced accumulation rates when compared to pure pelagic sequences and are thus attractive targets for high resolution paleoceanographic studies. Several expeditions of the IODP/ODP (e. g. 162, 172, 303, 306, 339, 342) therefore have successfully targeted giant contourite drifts. An unexplored area {{in this context is}} a prominent contourite depositional system (CDS) located in the southernmost sector of the extensional Argentine margin. Here the thermohaline circulation is characterized by the interaction of northwardflowing Antarctic water masses (Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; Circumpolar Deep Water, CDW; Antarctic Bottom Water, AABW) and southward-flowing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The transfer of heat and energy via these water masses constitutes an important component in maintaining the <b>global</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> We investigate an extensive set of high quality seismic reflection profiles from the Argentine continental margin to detect, characterize and map sedimentary features related to bottom current activity and to reconstruct past changes in the abyssal circulation. Typical margin-parallel morphosedimentary features such as (1) a set of four terraces on the slope and rise, (2) channels separating the terraces, (3) a giant buried sediment drift, and (4) sheeted drifts on the abyssal plain indicate that along slope (contour current) transport dominates over downslope (turbiditic) processes at the southern Argentine margin. Along the central Argentine margin the relative importance of the permanent, steady bottom currents and the shorter-duration, unsteady mass wasting processes on sediment deposition was variable in time and space. Based on a detailed investigation of a continental slope terrace at the southern margin and the mapping of depocenter geometries of four major seismic units at the central margin a chronology of the depositional processes during the Cenozoic was derived: While the Paleocene/Eocene (65 – 34 Ma) is characterized by hemipelagic sedimentation under relatively sluggish bottom water conditions, strong AABW circulation led to widespread erosion on the slope and growth of a large detached sediment drift during the Oligocene and early Miocene (34 – 17 Ma). After deposition of an aggradational seismic unit interpreted to represent low bottom current activity during the Mid-Miocene climatic optimum (17 – 14 Ma), a current reorganization through the emergence of Lower CDW took place at approx. 14 – 12 Ma when the Valentin Feilberg Terrace started growing. Current controlled sedimentation under moderate flow speed commenced at the southern Argentine margin during the middle to late Miocene (12 – 6 Ma) {{but at the same time}} gravitational down-slope sediment transport increased at the central Argentine margin possibly related to tectonic uplift in South America. The Pliocene to Holocene unit at the southern Argentine margin indicates strengthening of bottom flow after 6 Ma possibly due to a general change in deep water mass organization following the closure of the Panamanian gateway. At the central Argentine margin this unit is very heterogeneous and formed by interactions of down-slope and along-slope sediment transport processes as indicated by the evolution of canyons, slope plastered drifts and channels. The available multichannel seismic profiles constitute a high-quality site survey and the results from our project may be used as background information for future ocean drilling in the region which would reveal important aspects of the deep water history and provide better age constraints. We here suggest a transect of drill sites on continental slope terraces in different water depths at the southern Argentine margin. Inferred sedimentations rate of > 8 cm/ 1, 000 years would make these drill sites suitable for high-resolution paleoclimatic studies of the Cenozoic. ...|$|E
40|$|Yan, Xiao-HaiThe {{emission}} {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) from human economy and social activity, such as burning of fossil fuel, cement industry, deforestation and so on, contribute to continuously increasing of GHGs, CO 2 for example. The increased GHGs concentration leads to the energy imbalance {{at the top of}} atmosphere and heat cumulating within the earth climate system. Understanding the ocean’s role in Earth’s energy budget is fundamental to evaluate climate variability and change, including the rate of global warming and the recent 18 -years’ so-called Global Surface Warming Hiatus (GSWH). Progress has been made continuously on this topic: studies show that the GSWH is related to external forcing changes, internal variability induced by trade wind and wind-driven circulation adjustment with the resulting heat redistribution within the climate system, and the warming up in subsurface and deeper ocean. There are a wide range of opinions among climate scientists and no unanimous conclusion has been drawn about the mechanism of the global warming hiatus. In this dissertation, the spatio-temporal variations of the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) were investigated to reveal the physical mechanisms of the global warming hiatus and the regional climate response in East Asia. Firstly, methods were developed to estimate temperature anomaly for subsurface and deeper layer from sea surface parameters provided by remote sensing, to generate new data sets for decadal climate variability research. A Self-Organizing Map Neural Network (SOM) was developed from Argo gridded data sets in order to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) from remote sensing data. The SOM maps were trained using anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST), height (SSH) and salinity(SSS) data from Argo gridded monthly anomaly data sets, labeled with Argo STA data for 2005 ∼ 2010 and then used to estimate the STAs at different depths in the North Atlantic from the sea surface data. The estimated STA maps and time series were compared with Argo STAs including independent data sets for validation. In the Gulf Stream Path areas, the STA estimations from the SOM algorithm show good agreement with in situ measurements taken from the surface down to 700 m depth, with a correlation coefficient lager than 0. 8. Sensitivity of the SOM, when including salinity shows that with SSS anomaly data in the SOM training process, reveal the importance of SSS information, which can improve the estimation of STA in the subtropical ocean by up to 30 %. In subpolar basins, the monthly climatology SST and SSH can also help to improve the estimation by as much as 40 %. STA time series for 1993 ∼ 2004 in the mid-latitude North Atlantic were estimated from remote sensing SST and altimetry time series using the SOM algorithm. Limitations for the SOM algorithm and possible error sources in the estimation are briefly discussed. Secondly, OHC spatio-temporal variations were analyzed using the empirical orthogonal function analysis. A meridional dipole has dominated the variation of the ocean heat content in the upper layer, and the warming in the upper layer of the Indian Ocean has been in “hiatus” since early 1980 s. Further, a very new and sophisticated causal analysis method revealed that the warming in the southern subtropical Indian Ocean contributed to the pre-conditioning and warming in the southern and tropical Atlantic since 1980 s and to the heat sequestration at the deeper layer in the Southern Ocean during the global surface warming hiatus period. In addition, zonal ocean heat content anomaly were found to shift westwards in a way that resembles Rossby wave, with a period of about 30 years, and phase speed of 1. 8 - 2. 5 cm/s. It takes about 60 years for the anomaly signal to travel from east Pacific to the Western Atlantic via the Indian Ocean. The redistribution of OHC in upper layer follows the surface branch of the <b>Global</b> <b>Ocean</b> <b>Conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> to travel westward from Pacific to the Atlantic via Indian Ocean. With an embedded atmospheric bridge linking the Atlantic SST with the Pacific trade winds, the global ocean and atmosphere forms a closed loop. This finding explains not only the occurrence of global warming hiatus, but also sheds light on the multi-decadal climate variability. Thirdly, the decadal variation of vertical OHC distribution and its impact on air-sea interaction in Western North Pacific were studied to reveal regional climate respond to global warming hiatus. The decadal variation of rapid intensification of Tropical Cyclones (TCs) in Western Northern Pacific were studied using TC best track datasets. The intensity and frequencies of intense TC peaked in 1960 s, and have not increased in a global warming climate. Compared to previous tropical cyclone (TC) studies that focus on the frequency of rapid intensification (RI), a new index (RITC) is proposed to measure the RI-level for category 4 - 5 TCs (Saffir–Simpson scale) in the western North Pacific. RITC is the maximum increase in the sustained-wind-speed per 24 -hour during the lifetime of a TC. The results show that the PDO modulation of the interannual ENSO-RI relationship is better represented with the new RITC than with the RI number. The interannual relationship between ENSO and RITC is strong and statistical significant in warm PDO while not significant in cold PDO, mainly attributed to the variation of zonal wind speed. On decadal time scales, the PDO’s modulations of ENSO’s effects on RITC are mainly attributed to the variations of upper ocean heat content and vertical wind shear. Our results have significant implications for the prediction of RI and long-term projections of major TC activity. In summary, OHC was used as tracer to study the decadal heat redistribution, horizontal and vertical, in Indian Ocean, Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Indian Ocean was found to be the accelerator for the global surface warming hiatus through supplying heat to the southern Atlantic Ocean. The redistribution of OHC in upper layer explains not only the global warming hiatus, but also the multi-decadal climate variability. The decadal variation in rapid intensification of intense TCs provides {{a better understanding of the}} decadal variation of the TC in Western North Pacific and a new perspective for the regional climate responding to the decadal variability of OHC under the changing climate.

40|$|Iron (Fe) is an {{essential}} trace element for marine life. Extremely low Fe concentrations limit primary production and nitrogen fixation in {{large parts of the}} oceans and consequently influence ocean ecosystem functioning. The importance of Fe for ocean ecosystems makes Fe one of the core chemical trace elements in the international GEOTRACES program. Despite the recognized importance of Fe, our present knowledge of its supply and biogeochemical cycle has been limited by mostly fragmentary datasets. Here, we present highly accurate dissolved Fe (DFe) values measured at an unprecedented high intensity (1407 samples) along the longest full ocean depth transect (17, 500 kilometers) covering the entire western Atlantic Ocean. DFe measurements along this transect unveiled details about the supply and cycling of Fe. External sources of Fe identified included off-shelf and river supply, hydrothermal vents and aeolian dust. Nevertheless, vertical processes such as the recycling of Fe resulting from the remineralization of sinking organic matter and the removal of Fe by scavenging still dominated the distribution of DFe. In the northern West Atlantic Ocean, Fe recycling and lateral transport from the eastern tropical North Atlantic Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) dominated the DFe-distribution. Finally, our measurements showed that the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), the major driver of the so-called <b>ocean</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> contains excess DFe relative to phosphate after full biological utilization and is therefore an important source of Fe for biological production in the <b>global</b> <b>ocean...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, the sub-thermocline waters of the {{southern}} tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean experienced a sharp cooling.

The models simulate a slow-down in the sub-thermocline cooling followed by a rapid warming towards the mid twenty-first century.

40|$|The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) was {{the most}} rapid and {{sustained}} increase in marine Phanerozoic biodiversity. What generated this biotic response across Palaeozoic seascapes {{is a matter of}} debate; several intrinsic and extrinsic drivers have been suggested. One is Ordovician climate, which in recent years has undergone a paradigm shift from a text-book example of an extended greenhouse to an interval with transient cooling intervals – at least during the Late Ordovician. Here, we show the first unambiguous evidence for a sudden Mid Ordovician icehouse, comparable in magnitude to the Quaternary glaciations. We further demonstrate the initiation of this icehouse to coincide with the onset of the GOBE. This finding is based on both abiotic and biotic proxies obtained from the most comprehensive geochemical and palaeobiological dataset yet collected through this interval. We argue that the icehouse conditions increased latitudinal and bathymetrical temperature and oxygen gradients initiating an Early Palaeozoic Great <b>Ocean</b> <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Belt.</b> This fuelled the GOBE, as upwelling zones created new ecospace for the primary producers.

Our compilation shows how the export of Southern Ocean and Mediterranean waters after the Younger Dryas 11. 6 kyr ago simultaneously triggered two dispersal events in the western and eastern Atlantic respectively. Each pathway injected larvae from refugia into ocean currents powered by a re-invigorated AMOC that led to the fastest postglacial range expansion ever recorded, covering 7500 km in under 400 years.

The model consists of three reduced gravity layers with an inviscid Sverdrupian interior and a western boundary layer. The net north-south exchange is made possible by setting appropriate western boundary conditions, so {{that most of the}} transport is confined to the western boundary layer, while the interior is the Sverdrupian solution to the wind stress. The flow across the equator is made possible by the change of potential vorticity by the Rayleigh friction in the western boundary layer, which is sufficient to permit water and the <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Belt</b> to cross the equator. The cross-equatorial flow is driven by a weak meridional pressure gradient in opposite direction in the two layers on the equator at the western boundary. The model is applied to the World Ocean with a realistic wind stress. The amplitude of the <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Belt</b> is set by the northward Ekman transport in the Southern Ocean and the outcropping latitude of the NADW.

40|$|The last 5500 {{years of}} climate change and {{environmental}} response in the northern Benguela Coastal Upwelling are reconstructed by means of three sediment cores from the inner shelf off central Namibia. The study is based on nutrient (δ 15 N, δ 13 C) and productivity proxies (accumulation rates of total organic carbon; AR TOC). Reconstructed sea surface temperatures (alkenone-derived SST) and temperatures at subsurface depths (T δ 18 O; based on tests of planktonic foraminifers) reflect the physical boundary conditions. The selection of proxy indicators proved a valuable basis for robust palaeo-climatic reconstructions, with the resolution ranging from multi-decadal (NAM 1) over centennial (core 178) to millennial scale (core 226620). The northern Benguela experienced pronounced and rapid perturbation during the middle and late Holocene, and apparently, not all are purely local in character. In fact, numerous correlations with records from the adjacent South African subcontinent and the northern hemisphere testify to global climatic teleconnections. The Holocene Hypsithermal, for instance, is just as evident as the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Roman Warm Period. The marked SST-rise associated with the latter is substantiated by other marine and terrestrial data from the South African realm. The LIA (at least its early stages) manifests itself in intensified winds and upwelling, which accords with increased rainfall receipts above the continental interior. It appears that climate signals are transferred both via the atmosphere and ocean. The combined analysis of SST and T δ 18 O proved a useful tool in order to differentiate between both pathways. SSTs are primarily controlled by the intensity of atmospheric circulation features, reflecting changes of upwelling-favourable winds. T δ 18 O records {{the temperature of the}} source water and often correlates with <b>global</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>conveyor</b> speed due to varying inputs of warm Agulhas Water.

After five years of development, including the design of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> and the speed of operations, Shiraishi opened the first <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> sushi Mawaru Genroku Sushi in Higashiosaka in 1958, eventually expanding to up to 250 restaurants all over Japan. However, by 2001, his company had just 11 restaurants. Shiraishi also invented a robotic sushi, served by robots, but this idea has not had commercial success.|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} a clear impact of aerosol {{particles}} on the radiation balance, whether and how aerosol particles influence precipitation is controversial. Here we use the ECHAM 6 -HAM global climate model coupled to an aerosol module to analyse whether an impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the timing and amount of precipitation can be detected in North Pacific warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> are the strongest precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones and are identified here with a Lagrangian technique, i. e. by objectively identifying the most strongly ascending trajectories in North Pacific cyclones. These <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> have been identified separately in 10 -year ECHAM 6 -HAM simulations with present-day and pre-industrial aerosol conditions. Then, the evolution of aerosols and cloud properties has been analysed in detail along the identified warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. The results show that, under present-day conditions, some warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are strongly polluted (i. e. high concentrations of black carbon and sulfur dioxide) due to horizontal transport from eastern Asia to the oceanic region where warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> start their ascent. In these polluted trajectories a weak delay and reduction of precipitation formation occurs compared to clean warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. However, all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of both polluted and clean trajectories at the time they start their ascent, and the typically more abundant clean trajectories strongly reduce the aerosol impact from the polluted trajectories. The main conclusion then is that the overall amount of precipitation is comparable in pre-industrial conditions, when all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are clean, and in present-day conditions, when warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of a mixture of clean and polluted trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Large {{quantities}} of commodities in different sizes transported on <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> should often be mea-sured automatically {{by two or}} three <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales. Continuous measurement can be dynamically performed by multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales, so that the masses of discrete objects on <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> can be determined in sequence according to the different lengths. <b>Belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 130 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minutes and more. The output signals from the multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor and the object to be measured in motion. This measuring system consists of the three-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales with load-cells, and the photo-electro switches which detect the measuring lengths of the objects and distance between each object in sequence. The experimental results on the multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales suggest that the algorithms proposed in this paper are effective enough to practical applications...|$|R

Dangerous phenomena which can be in direct connection with the use of <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> are the ones regarding: - sparks influence over the coating layer and/or resistance internal structure of the stopped conveyor belt; - propagation of a flame along the length of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> that was exposed to a energy source relative high like a fire or due to blockage of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> as a result of the driving mechanism still operating, that generate a local heating of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> in contact with the driving drum, rollers or any other heating source generated by friction. Determining the safety parameters characteristic of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> by employing test methods allows assessment of the safety level as well as certification of their explosion protection quality when used in environments with explosion danger...|$|R
