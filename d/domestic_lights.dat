60|$|In this noble modesty, in this {{beautiful}} simplicity, in this serene avoidance {{of the least}} attempt to 'improve' an occasion which might be supposed to have sunk of its own weight into my heart, I seemed to have happily come, in a few steps, from the churchyard with its open grave, which {{was the type of}} Death, to the Christian dwelling side by side with it, which was the type of Resurrection. I never shall think of the former, without the latter. The two will always rest side by side in my memory. If I had lost any one dear to me in this unfortunate ship, if I had made a voyage from Australia to look at the grave in the churchyard, I should go away, thankful to GOD that that house was so close to it, and that its shadow by day and its <b>domestic</b> <b>lights</b> by night fell upon the earth in which its Master had so tenderly laid my dear one's head.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTriatoma dimidiata {{is one of}} {{the primary}} vectors of Chagas disease. We {{previously}} documented the spatio-temporal infestation of houses by this species in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, and found that non-domiciliated triatomines were specifically attracted to houses. However, the factors mediating this attraction remained unclear. Artificial light has been {{known for a long time}} to attract many insect species, and therefore may contribute to the spread of different vector-borne diseases. Also, based on the collection of different species of triatomines with light traps, several authors have suggested that light might attract triatomines to houses, but the role of artificial light in house infestation has never been clearly demonstrated and quantified. Here we performed a spatial analysis of house infestation pattern by T. dimidiata in relation to the distribution of artificial light sources in three different villages from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. In all three villages, infested houses were significantly closer to public street light sources than non-infested houses (18. 0 ± 0. 6 vs 22. 6 ± 0. 4 m), and street lights rather than <b>domestic</b> <b>lights</b> were associated with house infestation. Accordingly, houses closer to a public street lights were 1. 64 times more likely to be infested than houses further away (OR, CI 95 % 1. 23 - 2. 18). Behavioral experiments using a dual-choice chamber further confirmed that adult male and females were attracted to white light during their nocturnal activity. Attraction was also dependent on light color and decreased with increasing wavelength. While public lighting is usually associated with increased development, these data clearly show that it also directly contributes to house infestation by non-domiciliated T. dimidiata...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{are taking}} an {{increasing}} {{place in the}} market of <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> because they produce light with low energy consumption. In the EU, by 2016, no traditional incandescent light sources will be available and LEDs may become the major <b>domestic</b> <b>light</b> sources. Due to specific spectral and energetic characteristics of white LEDs as compared to other <b>domestic</b> <b>light</b> sources, some concerns have been raised regarding their safety for human health and particularly potential harmful risks for the eye. To conduct a health risk assessment on systems using LEDs, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), a public body reporting to the French Ministers for ecology, for health and for employment, has organized a task group. This group consisted physicists, lighting and metrology specialists, retinal biologist and ophthalmologist who have worked together for a year. Part of this work has comprised the evaluation of group risks of different white LEDs commercialized on the French market, according to the standards and found {{that some of these}} lights belonged to the group risk 1 or 2. This paper gives a comprehensive analysis of the potential risks of white LEDs, taking into account pre-clinical knowledge as well as epidemiologic studies and reports the French Agency's recommendations to avoid potential retinal hazards...|$|R

40|$|About 68 million {{households}} in India rely on kerosene as a fuel for <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting.</b> Kerosene-based lighting devices, {{not only for}} poor quality of light, {{but also for the}} risks of indoor air pollution and fire hazards, etc. are not a desired option for <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> purposes.

The basis of comparison is the acceptable daily costs or rental to the user {{as well as to the}} owner of the charging station. Further, the paper studies the impact of likely escalation in kerosene price on the acceptable daily rental and estimates the amount of subsidy required to make the charging station model viable for disseminating solar lanterns among rural households.

25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is produced}} from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing compounds; it forms {{when there is}} not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion engine in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. Coal gas, which was widely used before the 1960s for <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting,</b> cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as iron smelting, still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.|$|R
2500|$|Solid-state or {{semiconductor}} dimmers {{were introduced}} to solve some of these problems. [...] Semiconductor dimmers switch on at an adjustable time (phase angle) {{after the start of}} each alternating current half-cycle, thereby altering the voltage waveform applied to lamps and so changing its RMS effective value. Because they switch instead of absorbing part of the voltage supplied, there is very little wasted power. Dimming can be almost instantaneous and is easily controlled by remote electronics. [...] This development also made it possible to make dimmers small enough to be used in place (within the pattress) of normal <b>domestic</b> <b>light</b> switches.|$|R
