5|$|Moscow <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a {{military}} that consumed {{as much as}} 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Evans was {{occasionally}} {{replaced by}} the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which {{also contributed to the}} band's ill feeling toward Evans. By the middle of 1974, the band <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, the Kingdom of England formed part of the Angevin empire {{spreading}} across Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, Henry II, who <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> this vast network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the English Channel to the territories of Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou in north-west France, onto Poitou and Gascony in the south-west. For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and then his sons Richard and John, to dominate France.|$|E

5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing {{that of the}} United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E

Working as an official in the Zanzibar and Pemba Paint Workers' Union and as an activist in the ASP, Okello had built himself a following and almost from the moment that he arrived on Zanzibar had been organizing a revolution {{that he planned to}} take place shortly after independence.

5|$|Sir Oliver Popplewell {{published}} his {{inquiry into the}} fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed {{the cause of the}} fire was from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up.</b> A number of police officers and 22spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E
5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for Â£16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo, although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to defuse the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque. He <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a large private library to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{maintained}} his pole position lead {{into the first}} corner. One lap later, Newman passed Montoya for the second position. After starting the race in twelfth, Martin had lost four positions to run eighteenth by lap 4. By the 10th lap, Johnson <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a 1.2 second lead over Newman. Bowyer, who began the race {{at the rear of}} the grid, had moved up thirteen positions to twenty-ninth by lap 15. Two laps later, Raines drove to his garage. On lap 18, Kurt Busch passed Vickers for ninth, as Kahne claimed fourth position from Biffle, two laps later. On lap 25, the competition caution came out.

5|$|Kurt Busch and Montoya {{moved into}} fourth and ninth {{positions}} respectively on lap 141. By the 150th lap, Johnson <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a 2.7 second lead over Hamlin. On lap 162, Johnson's lead of 3.4 seconds {{was reduced to}} nothing when debris was spotted on the track, causing a caution. During the caution, some of the leaders elected to make pit stops. Johnson remained the leader on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Hamlin. Two laps later, a multi-car collision occurred on the front straightway as Earnhardt lost control of his car, and collected Logano, Scott Speed, Hornish, Bobby Labonte, Kenseth, Stewart, Vickers and Keselowski. The damaged cars headed to the pit road during the caution as crews cleaned up debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate deicing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that <b>had</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E
