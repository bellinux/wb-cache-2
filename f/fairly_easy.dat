Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to grow {{in areas}} with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} coefficient Correlation coefficients {{are used to}} measure the strength of the relationship or association between two quantitative variables. For example, Table 1 shows height, muscle strength and age in 41 alcoholic men. We will begin with the relationship between height and strength. Figure 1 shows a plot of strength against height. This is a scatter diagram. Each point represents one subject. If we look at Figure 1, it is <b>fairly</b> <b>easier</b> to see that taller men tend to be stronger than shorter men, or, looking at the other way round, that stronger men tend to be taller than weaker men. It is only a tendency, the tallest man is not the strongest not is the shortest man the weakest. Correlation enables us to measure how close this association is. The {{correlation coefficient}} is based on the products of differences from the mean of the two variables. That is, for each observation we subtract the mean, just as when calculating a standard deviation. We then multiply the deviations from the mean for the two variables for a subject together, and add them. We call this the sum of products about the mean. It is very like the sum of squares about the mean used fo...|$|R
5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to cross. Local inhabitants {{were able to}} maintain fields on the other side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> {{to grow in}} a {{mediterranean}} climate with good drainage and a light (sandy) soil; however, with medium to high susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, it is unreliable in conditions that favour {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mould, such as summer humidity or poor drainage. The use of phosphite fungicides does reduce the spread of Phytophthora. It generally does poorly in eastern Australia, although it is grown commercially in southeastern South Australia as a cut flower crop. It is also grown in California and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
50|$|Most motor {{vehicles}} have internal combustion engines. They are <b>fairly</b> cheap, <b>easy</b> to maintain, reliable, safe and small. Since these engines burn fuel, {{they have long}} ranges but pollute the environment. A related engine is the external combustion engine. An {{example of this is}} the steam engine. Aside from fuel, steam engines also need water, making them impractical for some purposes. Steam engines also need time to warm up, whereas IC engines can usually run right after being started, although this may not be recommended in cold conditions. Steam engines burning coal release sulfur into the air, causing harmful acid rain.|$|R

50|$|The ghost ring sight is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the fastest type of aperture sight. It is <b>fairly</b> accurate, <b>easy</b> to use, and obscures the target less than nearly all other non-optical sights. Because of this, ghost ring sights are commonly installed on combat shotguns and submachine guns (and to a much lesser extent, rifles). The ghost ring is a fairly recent innovation, and differs from traditional aperture sights in the extreme thinness of the rear ring, and the slightly thicker front sight. The thin ring minimizes the occlusion of the target, while the thicker front post makes it easy to find quickly.|$|R
5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the Burmese had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. The Burmese had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he swung open the gates of the city and dared the Burmese King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E

50|$|This species {{occurs in}} pairs during the {{breeding}} season and bigger groups, {{as many as}} 12, at other times. It walks nimbly or hops with help from its wings in the canopy or sub-canopy of the forest, especially in trees with flowers or fruit that it eats. To cross clearings it sets off with fast wingbeats and then glides, giving another flurry of wingbeats if needed to maintain its height.

50|$|Reliance Industries {{and other}} textile {{manufactures}} set up synthetic fibre plants in India significantly reducing {{the price of}} synthetic fibre and the Indian middle class jumped at {{the opportunity to be}} well dressed in a fabric which though unsuited to India's climate was <b>fairly</b> cheap, <b>easy</b> to maintain and long-lasting. The safari suit continued to be the de facto business attire, particularly in government/public sectors and the SMB arena in India, through the late-1990s. With India's growth over the 1990s, liberalization and with the middle class suddenly having more disposable income, the younger generations began to gravitate towards more modern western fashions such as suits and other business attire. Although it is still visible in some parts of India, the Safari suit is now indelibly associated with the so-called License Raj - the slow, inefficient Indian bureaucracy of the 1970s and the 1980s.|$|R

However, the final match produced the shock of the round where Argentina upset Ireland 28–24 in Lens.|$|E
50|$|Microdermabrasion is a <b>fairly</b> simple, <b>easy,</b> painless, non-invasive, skin {{rejuvenation}} procedure using {{a combination}} of a fine abrasive tip or crystals and vacuum suction applied to the skin. Typically there are no needles or anesthetics required for microdermabrasion. The vacuum pressure and speed are adjusted depending on the sensitivity and tolerance of the skin. Microdermabrasion is often compared to the feeling of a cat licking the skin- a rough but gentle texture. Typical microdermabrasion sessions can last anywhere from 5-60 minutes. Minimal to no recovery time is required after microdermabrasion and most people immediately return to daily activity after a session. Makeup and non-irritating creams can usually be applied within a few hours or right after microdermabrasion. Since there is an often immediate increased minor skin sensitivity after microdermabrasion, irritating products like glycolic acids, Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Retinoid products or fragranced creams and lotions are typically avoided right after the procedure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantages}} of a focometer over other methods for use in developing countries are that it is lightweight, compact, relatively inexpensive, <b>fairly</b> quick, and <b>easy</b> to use with minimal training.

25|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still <b>fairly</b> <b>easy</b> to cross. Local inhabitants could cross to maintain fields {{on the other}} side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Those who were unable to obtain passes could usually bribe the border guards or sneak across. Refugees from the east, many of them Germans expelled from other countries in central and eastern Europe, were guided across the boundary by villagers in exchange for hefty fees. Other locals on both sides smuggled goods across to supplement their meagre incomes. The number of border migrants remained high despite the increase in East German security measures; 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
