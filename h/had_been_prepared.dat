5|$|Both Tigers {{suffered}} early mechanical failures, {{and neither}} finished the race. The engines <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> by Shelby {{but had not}} been properly developed, {{and as a result}} overheated; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes. All three of the Le Mans Tigers have survived.|$|E
5|$|In any case, the Cần Vương revolt {{started on}} July 5, 1885 when Thuyet {{launched}} a surprise {{attack against the}} colonial forces after a diplomatic confrontation with the French. Thuyet took Hàm Nghi northwards to the Tan So mountain base near the border with Laos after the attack failed. The campaign was launched when the emperor issued the Can Vuong edict that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> by the regent.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{crystalline}} nanoparticles from Y-Zr 02 and FeOx <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> by microemulsion {{with subsequent}} solvothermal treatment and by precipitation processes. In both cases, aqueous based intermediates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> surface-modified by carboxylic acids and ammosilane. The surface modification prevents {{the formation of}} hard agglomerates of the nanoparticles (6 - 8 ran) completely and provides complete redispersibility. Low sintering compacts and nanocomposites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared,</b> and first results for using the FeOx nanoparticles for medical applications <b>have</b> <b>been</b> obtained...|$|R
40|$|In 2010 – 2012, {{scientists}} of Riga Technical University {{have developed the}} hydrogeological model of Latvia (LAMO). In 2013, the first practical results <b>have</b> <b>been</b> provided by LAMO. The set of hydrogeological maps and groundwater flow balances <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> to update the current water management plan for the Gauja River basin district in Latvia. For aquifers, distributions of groundwater heads and infiltration flows <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> In the maps of heads, directions of groundwater flows and connections of aquifers with rivers are shown. A set of geological profiles <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> A profile represents geological stratigraphy, isolines of groundwater head and directions of groundwater flows. Groundwater flow balances <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for the whole territory of Latvia and for the Gauja River basin district...|$|R
5|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} of food crops, many civilians were forced to leave the hills and surrender to the TNI. Often, when surviving villagers came down to lower-lying regions to surrender, the military would execute them. Those who were not killed outright by TNI troops were sent to receiving centers for vetting, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> in advance in the vicinity of local TNI bases. In these transit camps, the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated. Those who were suspected of being members of the resistance were killed.|$|E
5|$|From {{his newly}} {{established}} command post, {{in the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for demolition, the explosives had not been attached. Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the code words 'Ham' and 'Jam' then brought Fox's platoon across the canal bridge, positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E

Methylthiomethyl, o-thioanisyl and thienyl oxazolines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> in one step, and o-diphenylphosphinophenyl oxazolines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> in two steps in good yields from commercially available starting materials...|$|R
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their riposte {{against the}} central column. Herff—who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo {{during the afternoon}} of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{gauge of}} the new line was not yet determined, {{although}} the estimates <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> {{on the basis that}} it would not exceed 6feet. Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had been to a gauge of 4ft6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4ft6½in (1,384mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5ft6in (1,676mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the gauge of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E
5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire, and one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession even though he had no hand in starting the fire.|$|E
25|$|Several groups <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>preparing</b> {{to protest}} near the convention.|$|R

5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|In both respects, {{little was}} {{achieved}} this day. The planned counterattack by the Light Division against the airborne troops on IJsselmonde failed. In {{the nick of}} time the bridge over the river Noord <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for defence by the German paratroopers, and it proved impossible to force it. Several attempts to cross the river by boat managed only to establish a few isolated bridgeheads, and at 10:15 the Light Division was given permission to break off the crossing at this point and ordered to shift its axis of attack by reinforcing Dutch troops on the Island of Dordrecht, where it arrived that night. After clearing the Island of Dordrecht of enemy troops the division was to advance into IJsselmonde over the Dordrecht bridge in order to reach Rotterdam.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{wished to}} secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was {{interest}} in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt {{that would have to}} be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.|$|E
50|$|Problems {{with the}} {{composition}} are encountered during synthesis. Two phases exist—the hexagonal SnSe2 phase and the orthorhombic SnSe phase. Specific nanostructures can be synthesized, but few 2D nanostructures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> Both square SnSe nanostructures and single-layer SnSe nanostructures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> Historically, phase-controlled synthesis of 2D tin selenide nanostructures is quite difficult.|$|R

5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared.</b> The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E
5|$|Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw {{were people}} who, {{after the end}} of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising and the {{subsequent}} planned destruction of Warsaw by Nazi Germany, decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city. The period of hiding spanned as long as three and a half months, from the day of the capitulation of the uprising, October 2, 1944, until the entry of the Red Army on January 17, 1945. Most of the Robinsons were Jews, although a considerable number of non-Jewish Poles were also present. The hideaways lived in the ruins of houses, basements, and bunkers which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> ahead of time. They lived in extremely dire circumstances, while the city was being destroyed around them. Some managed to escape Warsaw, many were captured and killed by the Germans, while others survived until the withdrawal of German troops.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{the town}} was {{disarmed}} and order restored, with the gambling equipment and weapons confiscated, and the saloons closed down. Hobbs then left Lawson in charge and caught the 4:00 p.m. train out of town that same day. The residents did not openly resist Hobbs or the militia, although nearly all were armed and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> to offer non-violent resistance. She stopped at the county seat in Baker City to officially remove the town's officials {{in front of a}} judge before returning to the state capitol in Salem. The Baker County Circuit Court quickly enjoined the militia from holding the town under martial law; Sheriff Rand began assembling a posse to carry out the court order. Governor West requested a hearing, seeking Rand's temporary removal from office, and appointed Hobbs to represent the State as special counsel.|$|E
5|$|A report <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> for {{the parish}} council in 1903 which noted the {{population}} in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
