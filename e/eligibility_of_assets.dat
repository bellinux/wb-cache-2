40|$|Several {{states are}} {{pursuing}} policies to foster renewable energy {{as part of}} efforts to restructure state electric power markets. The primary policies that states are pursuing for renewables are system benefits charges (SBCs) and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs). However, the <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> biomass under state RPS and SBC policies is in question in some states.

Using a regression discontinuity framework, I find that Medicare <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> an older wife {{increases the likelihood that}} a Medicare-ineligible husband is uninsured. Spousal Medicare eligibility also has large impacts on the source of coverage for privately-insured, Medicare-ineligible spouses, but has no effect on the health care use or labor market participation of ineligible spouses...|$|R
