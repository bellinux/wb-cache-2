40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{completing}} the final project report, {{with regard to the}} USIZO LOMUSA Feeding Scheme business engineering model, the relevant student had to focus on the development of an economic feasible solution that can be validated. The criteria for the final project report is primarily linked to the ECSA one- and ECSA three exit-level outcomes, which involve the application of problem solving tools and techniques to the project specific environment. It is of utmost importance that creative-, procedural- and/or non-procedural engineering designs are incorporated within the final project report to demonstrate competence. The USIZO LOMUSA Feeding Scheme business engineering model project was instigated by three independent volunteers who are currently preparing two meals per day for a group of specially identified children of Blaauwbosch Primary School, situated within the Osizweni community that is based in Northern KwaZulu Natal. The individuals contacted Mr Mntambo, a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) committee member and environmental manager employed at ArcelorMittal Newcastle works, requesting company assistance related to a mobile <b>kitchen</b> <b>unit.</b> The volunteers intend to use the mobile <b>kitchen</b> <b>unit</b> to generate an additional income in order to subsidize the second meal of each day, since the first is funded by the Department of Education. In several cases it is the only two meals that are provided to the children on a daily basis. The primary objective of the USIZO LOMUSA Feeding Scheme project was to develop a business engineering model that is related to the requested mobile kitchen. However, it was recommended that the relevant comprehensive business engineering model have to be applicable to all schools situated within the Southern African border in need of a feeding scheme. Thus, a business engineering model that is applicable to any school environment was developed and will be validated at the Blaauwbosch Primary School as a first iteration early next year. The first iteration of the USIZO LOMUSA Feeding Scheme, which will be implemented at Blaauwbosch Primary School and the three model specific secondary schools that were identified, promises to provide food to three thousand and thirty four (3034) children. During the execution period of the USIZO LOMUSA Feeding Scheme business engineering model final project report, thorough research was conducted, followed by a detailed investigation of the problem. The concept of the business engineering model was explored and clearly defined before the student attended to the advanced development, engineering design and evaluation of the project. In conclusion, the student considered numerous aspects related to the and post development of the project. The final project report will be summarised in a user manual format, for the future expansion of the USIZO LOMUSA Feeding Scheme business engineering model. When one candle lights another, it will not lose any of its power to produce light. Although a feeding scheme as proposed will not deliver visible profit margins as a business enterprise should, the result of this venture lead to a healthier and better educated work force that will only positively be experienced in years to come. The potential financial gain the country will experience {{at that point in time}} will be immeasurable. Many candles (feeding schemes) will undoubtedly enlighten the lives of several children in need and will eventually lead to a brighter and prosperous future. Thesis (B Eng.

40|$|IKEA offer a 25 year {{warranty}} {{with most}} of their kitchen articles, {{which has led to}} more extensive testing conducted according to current European and international standards. An assembled <b>kitchen</b> <b>unit</b> is used in all the tests but a translation into the effect on the individual parts of the unit is needed. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the test methods, to prioritize which kitchen units to test and to find a test closer to the manufacturing process of particle boards for the over-opening test of pivoting doors. A way to prioritize in the range was made possible by creating risk factors based on usage frequency in combination with mechanical calculations on load cases of doors and drawers. User behavior in the kitchen was studied in contextual interviews and these showed that most behavior is tested by IKEA with the most important exception of forces applied to knobs and handles. An analysis of usage frequency and test methods showed that the amount of cycles in the durability tests of doors and drawers could be revised. The technical properties of particle boards were compared to test results from over-opening tests, without finding any correlations. This lead to experiments on the break-off scenario of hinges with the result that a correlation was found between the deformation of the holes used for attaching the hinges and the over opening break-off load. Since the experiments were made on a small scale it is recommended that the correlation is investigated on a larger scale. Optimally a correlation could be found between hole deformation and a technical property of the particle board. the consequence would be that the over-opening test could be replaced or supported by a demand on the technical property of the particle board. ...|$|E
