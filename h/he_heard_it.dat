5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Haydn {{appreciated}} the opera greatly, writing {{to a friend}} that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> in his dreams. In summer 1790 Haydn attempted to produce the work with his own company at Eszterháza, but was prevented from doing so {{by the death of}} his patron, Nikolaus Esterházy.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{his hands}} and serious {{diminution}} of his eyesight apparently resulted in Heim acquiring an eidetic, acoustic memory. He was claimed to rarely forget a formula if <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> recited, and was said to be able to learn a language in a matter of days. He married a former concert singer from Prague in 1950 named Gerda.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Bogdanovich resurfaced with The Cat's Meow. Returning {{once again}} to a {{reworking}} of the past, this time the supposed murder of director Thomas Ince by Orson Welles's bête noire William Randolph Hearst, The Cat's Meow was a modest critical success but made little money at the box office. Bogdanovich says he was {{told the story of}} the alleged Ince murder by Welles, who in turn said <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> from writer Charles Lederer.|$|E
25|$|With the {{termination}} of the monopoly of the East India Company's charter in 1833 through the Government of India Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85), the trade in long ells to China declined, and Thomas Fox developed the production of flannel, which was sold in the home market and to America. Following his Quaker beliefs, Thomas Fox refused to sell flannel to the East India Company when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> would {{be used in the}} manufacture of cartridges.|$|E

500|$|So I {{went home}} and called my dog, E Base, who plays a lot of {{instruments}} up at Baseline [...] for me and [...] Just Blaze. [...] came through. I programmed the drums in 10 minutes, and then he played all the different parts. This version is all live bass, live guitars, [...] chords on it.

500|$|For {{all their}} {{attempts}} at secrecy, Townshend learned of Moon's move. [...] Beck recalled, [...] "I remember [...] Townshend looking daggers {{at me when}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it...</b> {{because it was a}} bit near the mark. He didn't want anybody meddling with that territory [...] at all". Townshend also took to referring to Beck and Page as [...] "flashy little guitarists of very little brain" [...] for their perceived subterfuge (Page responded with [...] "Townshend got into feedback because he couldn't play single notes"). In a later interview, Townshend explained ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ingredients}} {{are given in}} verse by a Cornishman from Bodmin, during William Sandys' 1846 tour around Cornwall. Sandys also includes a story of Christmas-time in Cornwall which includes the pie served with mashed potatoes and pilchards. In [...] "Verses Occasioned by Ben Tyrrell's Mutton Pies", published in 1772, Thomas Warton also confirmed that the squab pie was mutton based and came from Cornwall. The Devon author, William Crossing, writing in 1911, discusses a short folk rhyme about squab pie: [...] "Mutton, onions, apples and dough, Make a good pie as any I know." [...] He does not say, however, from where <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> In the [...] song [...] "Glorious Devon" [...] written by Sir Edward German in 1905, several Devonshire dishes receive praise: [...] "Squab pie, junket and cider brew, Richest cream of the cow, What 'ud Old England without 'em do?" ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{opened to}} {{critical}} acclaim. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly deemed [...] "Speak Now" [...] one of Swift's best songs yet. He also said, [...] "Her expressive {{delivery of the}} lyrics makes up for any shortcomings as a technical vocalist" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "expertly catchy". He concluded that he was unable to stop playing the song after <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> Bill Lamb of About.com said the song was [...] "brilliant". He continued, [...] "The song is sweet, funny, bratty, and edgy all at the same time. Taylor Swift remains one of our most gifted young lyricists." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine thought that [...] "Speak Now" [...] exemplified Swift's inability to [...] "write authoritatively about anything other than how great boys are or how much boys suck or how dreams about boys will take her somewhere better than where she is now." ...|$|E
500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated wisps of Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man who could get {{any one of us}} out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E
500|$|Delius later {{liked to}} {{represent}} his house at Solano Grove as [...] "a shanty", {{but it was}} a substantial cottage of four rooms, with plenty of space for Delius to entertain guests. Ward sometimes stayed there, as did an old Bradford friend, Charles Douglas, and Delius's brother Ernest. Protected from excessive summer heat by river breezes and a canopy of oak trees, the house was an agreeable place to live in. Delius paid little attention to the business of growing oranges, and continued to pursue his musical interests. Jacksonville had a rich, though to a European, unorthodox musical life. Randel notes that in local hotels, the African-American waiters doubled as singers, with daily vocal concerts for patrons and passers-by, giving Delius his introduction to spirituals. Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. [...] "Delius never forgot the singing as <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; {{it is hard to imagine}} conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges—or more conducive to composing." ...|$|E

60|$|And then <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Lydgate's {{account of}} the {{troubles}} which Rosamond had already depicted to him in her way.

500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E
500|$|Manager and label owner Gudinski {{visited the}} US in December 1974 {{to promote his}} {{recording}} artists, including Skyhooks, Daddy Cool, and Madder Lake, to major labels there. At that time only Ayers Rock were successful, with Gudinski signing them to A Records within days. He told Tony Wilson of The Sun, [...] "Jerry Moss, the president of A Records USA, flipped when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> so A will release it (Big Red Rock) world-wide." [...] This {{was a surprise to}} the Australian media, since many other artists were more commercially successful locally than Ayers Rock. Skyhooks were Australia's most popular band; their first album (Living in the 70's, released in October 1974) sold 226,000 units, the best-selling album by a local artist in Australia to date. However, Living in the 70's was rejected by A and not released outside Australia. Ayers Rock were the first Mushroom Records artists to sign a recording contract with an international label. From the mid-1970s, and into the 1990s, Mushroom were successful with many other artists including Split Enz, Kylie Minogue, and Yothu Yindi, turning the label into Australia's largest independent record company.|$|E
500|$|Through his {{association}} with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded. He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, [...] "gave him a model for an orchestral sound". Bridge also led Britten {{to the music of}} Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: [...] "The real musicians are so few & far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs & Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?" [...] – adding, as an afterthought: [...] "Shostakovitch – perhaps – possibly". By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English pastoral school represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the [...] "brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger"; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements. Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought Brigg Fair [...] "delicious" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> in 1931. Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he found [...] "bewildering and terrifying", {{yet at the same time}} [...] "incredibly marvellous and arresting". The same composer's Symphony of Psalms, and Petrushka were lauded in similar terms. [...] However, he and Stravinsky later developed a mutual antipathy informed by jealousy and mistrust.|$|E

500|$|Michael Lydon, {{another of}} Charles' biographers, {{summarized}} {{the impact of}} the song: [...] "'What'd I Say' was a monster with footprints bigger than its numbers. Daringly different, wildly sexy, and fabulously danceable, the record riveted listeners. When 'What'd I Say' came on the radio, some turned it off in disgust, but millions turned the volume up to blasting and sang 'Unnnh, unnnh, oooooh, oooooh' along with Ray and the Raelets. [...] became the life of a million parties, the spark of as many romances, and a song to date the Summer by." [...] The song's impact was not immediately seen in the U.S.; it was particularly popular in Europe. Paul McCartney was immediately struck by the song and knew when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> {{that he wanted to be}} involved in making music. George Harrison remembered an all-night party he attended in 1959 where the song was played for eight hours non-stop: [...] "It was one of the best records I ever heard." [...] While the Beatles were developing their sound in Hamburg, they played [...] "What'd I Say" [...] at every show, trying to see how long they could make the song last and using the audience in the call and response, with which they found immense popularity. The opening electric piano in the song was the first John Lennon had ever heard, and he tried to replicate it with his guitar. Lennon later credited Charles' opening of [...] "What'd I Say" [...] to the birth of songs dominated by guitar riffs.|$|E
