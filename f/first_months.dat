40|$|Abstract Background In this {{exploratory}} study, {{the contribution}} of delivery type to the weight gain pattern for full-term infants with exclusive breastfeeding in the <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of infancy was determined. In addition, breastfeeding success among cesarean section (C-section) delivery mothers based on their neonate's weight gain {{at the end of}} the <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of infancy was evaluated. Methods A cohort of 92 neonates born in Shiraz, from July 10 to August 10, 2007 was followed longitudinally. The data were collected during the <b>first</b> <b>month</b> postpartum at three occasions: 3 to 7 days postpartum, 10 - 21 days postpartum and 24 - 31 days postpartum. Results Among 92 mothers in this study, 35 (38 %) were delivered by C-section. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) showed that delivery type (p Conclusions Type of delivery contributes strongly to the weight gain pattern in the <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of infancy. In spite of greater weight loss among C-section birth neonates in the first days of life, {{at the end of the}} <b>first</b> <b>month</b> neonates showed a similar weight gain. Consequently, mothers with C-section delivery can successfully exclusively breastfeed. </p...|$|R

Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E

5|$|Over the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated {{repeatedly in}} the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden.

Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
