5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were {{deposited in the}} shield stage of the volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's post-shield stage. The rock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E

30|$|The average {{abundance}} of infrequent species {{did not significantly}} differ between habitats (Table 3). The average {{abundance of}} M. glareolus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meadow was lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> or advanced forest, and average abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> forest was lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advanced forest. The average abundance of Microtus voles, on the contrary, was at its lowest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advanced forest, i.e. lower than <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> <b>young</b> forest or meadow; their abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meadow and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> forest did not differ. Thus, <b>the</b> recorded changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> average abundances of small mammals between habitats could largely be attributed to <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most abundant species.|$|R

Circumstances and causes of transformation of fertility in this age group of women are based on usage of theoretical concepts related to fertility issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> age. <b>The</b> chosen period shows a number of changes in socioeconomic, political and legislative way. The transformation of <b>the</b> society <b>in</b> 20 th century had influence on fertility level and fertility timing. Form of motherhood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> age has changed also. Differences of characteristics of fertility in youngest age influenced by social evolution were shown on example of comparison of young women fertility evolution in Czech Republic, France and Romania. It approves that fertility level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> age can be the driver of the social progression. Keywords: fertility, Czech Republic, young mothe...|$|R
5|$|Several {{species were}} {{incorrectly}} assigned to Gorgosaurus {{in the twentieth}} century. A complete skull of a small tyrannosaurid (CMNH 7541), found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger,</b> late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana, was named Gorgosaurus lancensis by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1946. This specimen was renamed Nanotyrannus by Bob Bakker and colleagues in 1988. Currently, many paleontologists regard Nanotyrannus as a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. Similarly, Evgeny Maleev created the names Gorgosaurus lancinator and Gorgosaurus novojilovi for two small tyrannosaurid specimens (PIN 553-1 and PIN 552-2) from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia in 1955. Kenneth Carpenter renamed the smaller specimen Maleevosaurus novojilovi in 1992, but both are now considered juveniles of Tarbosaurus bataar.|$|E

He took a total of 1/35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped {{immediately}} afterwards. He did not play again for the Under-16s for two years, and in November 1999, {{less than a month after}} turning 15, he made his next appearance, this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra. He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3/41 in a victory, but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match, and spent the rest of the 1999–2000 season there. He bowled short spells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> division, taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches, averaging less than seven overs an innings. He had more success with the bat, scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
