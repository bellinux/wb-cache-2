5|$|The 1974 {{series in}} the West Indies was of five Tests. The West Indian team were {{regarded}} as the better side, and for them to only draw the series was a surprise. After they won the first Test <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> that the series would become a one-sided contest. This Test was notable for a controversial Alvin Kallicharran run out that triggered protests. England managed to secure draws {{in the next three}} Tests, thanks to Dennis Amiss' 262 in the second Test and Keith Fletcher's 129 in the third, while rain prevented a result in the fourth Test. The last match at Queen's Park Oval was a close game, with England winning by 26 runs, primarily due to Tony Greig taking 13 wickets bowling off-spin and Boycott scoring 212 runs in the match. England thereby levelled the series, which finished 1–1.|$|E
25|$|I do {{not know}} how many men I saw, but {{certainly}} during this one march not less than 5,000. Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> a very harmless joke then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> {{like the}} {{beginning}} of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, {{more than thirty years}} later, to realize that it was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk, the anticipation of dinner and a book...What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other. p98, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, even though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to be settled {{in favor of the}} church in 1619. Though the regents knew better than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
25|$|There were {{criticisms of}} his leadership, too, {{some of which}} he {{eventually}} acknowledged. Many Indo-Fijians criticised him for not doing more to thwart the 1987 coups which removed an Indo-Fijian dominated administration from office, and for giving his consent to a new constitution, drafted in 1990, which guaranteed indigenous Fijian supremacy and was widely regarded as racist, even drawing comparisons from some quarters with South Africa's apartheid system. Mara defended {{his role in the}} post-coup era of 1987 to 1992, arguing that he was doing the best he could in circumstances that he could not fully control, and that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> better at the time to connive in the writing of a discriminatory constitution than to risk civil war at the hands of ethnic Fijian extremists. In 1996, he publicly apologised to the Indo-Fijian community {{for his role in the}} drafting of the 1990 Constitution. Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Indo-Fijian community who in 1999 became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, said that he did not agree with, but understood, Mara's reasons for acting as he did, and accepted his apology for having done so. Other opponents, both Indo-Fijian and ethnic Fijian, were less forgiving, however.|$|E
25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season could be out of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> like a good pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and not so great if they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E

500|$|Talbot {{suggested}} Arthur Sifton, the province's chief justice. [...] Sifton was a Liberal, {{but as a}} judge he was {{remote from}} political mudslinging. [...] However, he had been offered the office of Premier in 1905, when <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> more desirable than it did now; would he have any interest?

500|$|Sherman's Atlanta Campaign {{concluded}} successfully on September 2, 1864, {{with the}} capture of the city, which Hood {{had been forced to}} abandon. [...] This success made Sherman a household name and helped ensure Lincoln's presidential re-election in November. [...] In August, the Democratic Party had nominated as its candidate George B. McClellan, the popular former Union army commander, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> likely that Lincoln would lose to McClellan. [...] Lincoln's defeat could well have meant the victory of the Confederacy, as the Democratic Party platform called for peace negotiations based on the acknowledgment of the Confederacy's independence. Thus {{the capture of}} Atlanta, coming when it did, may have been Sherman's greatest contribution to the Union cause.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies. In an interview after the race, Szisz {{reflected on the}} [...] "anxiety" [...] he had felt as he drove the final laps: [...] "I feared something small which would take away victory {{at the moment when}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to be won." [...] The prestige Renault gained from Szisz's victory led to an increase in sales for the company, from around 1,600cars in 1906 to more than 3,000 a year later, and increasing to more than 4,600 in 1908. But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty-three French cars that had started the race finished it.|$|E

500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
500|$|Sex is now {{considered}} a bold, post-feminist, work of art, besides being labeled a [...] "cultural book". Martin Amis from The Observer wrote an essay discussing the book's cultural meaning. Critical theorist Douglas Kellner affirmed that with Sex [...] "Madonna became herself, an artifact of pop culture". French academic writer Georges Claude Guilbert (author of three books about Madonna) described Sex {{as one of the}} most successful publicity stunts in history whereas Russell W. Belk, author of Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, mentioned that the book is a quality product in marketing. In 1992, Madonna had generated more than US$500million ($ in [...] dollars) to Time Warner in sales of both albums and the Sex book, despite the negative feedback. However, Taraborrelli commented in his book, , that those [...] "who knew Madonna well at that time, knew what was really going on with her: the Sex book—and the outrageous antics that preceded it and would follow it—was really just something she used as a barrier between her and the rest of the world." [...] For years <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to Madonna that both her personal and professional life was extremely scrutinized by the public and media, and although she had started this scrutinizing by her provocative works, she was tired of it. Being vexed at this interest in her personal life, Madonna fought back by creating the persona of a renegade, something so outrageous as to defy explanation, something found objectionable by most people. Taraborrelli said that in Madonna's view, [...] "she had no other way of fighting back". The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert analyzed the singer's provocative attempt in an article published in the newspaper: ...|$|E

[...] <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> obvious to many modern theorists that Uqair must be Gerrha and the identification seemed clinched by {{the fact that in the}} local dialect of the Arabic, the letter 'q' was pronounced as a 'g.'

2500|$|Zamenhof taught {{an early}} version of the {{language}} to his high-school classmates. [...] Then, for several years, he worked on translations and poetry to refine his creation. In 1895 he wrote, [...] "I worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, even though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to me in 1878 that it was already completely ready." [...] When he was ready to publish, the Czarist censors would not allow it. [...] Stymied, he spent his time in translating works such as the Bible and Shakespeare. [...] This enforced delay led to continued improvement. [...] In July 1887 he published his Unua Libro (First Book), a basic introduction to the language. This was essentially the language spoken today.|$|E
2500|$|Bouchard's raiders landed {{first at}} Refugio Canyon, where they pillaged and burned the ranch {{belonging}} to the Ortega family, killing cattle and slitting the throats of horses. However, after being alerted by messengers from Monterey, the Presidio dispatched a squadron of cavalry, who caught three stragglers from the ill-disciplined raiding party and dragged them back to Santa Barbara in chains. Bouchard sailed the remaining [...] to Santa Barbara a few days later, anchoring off of present-day Milpas Street, and threatened to shell the town unless his men were returned to him. [...] José de la Guerra y Noriega, the comandante of the Presidio, granted his request, but Bouchard {{did not realize that}} he had been tricked: the town was not as heavily defended as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to be; the hundreds of cavalrymen Bouchard had seen through his spyglass were but the same few dozen riding in large circles, stopping and changing costumes each time they passed behind a patch of heavy brush. Although Bouchard had recently destroyed Monterey, he departed without attacking the town.|$|E
2500|$|By March 1924 Puccini had {{completed}} the opera up to the final duet. However, he was unsatisfied with {{the text of the}} final duet, and did not continue until 8 October, when he chose Adami's fourth version of the duet text. On 10 October he was diagnosed with throat cancer and on 24 November went to Brussels, Belgium, for treatment. There he underwent a new and experimental radiation therapy treatment. Puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son. Puccini, however, seems to have had some inkling of the possible seriousness of his condition since, before leaving for Brussels, he visited Toscanini and begged him, [...] "Don't let my Turandot die". [...] He {{died of a heart attack}} on 29 November 1924, when <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> that the radium treatment was succeeding. His step-daughter Fosca was in fact joyfully writing a letter to an English friend of the family, Sibyl Seligman, telling her that the cancer was shrinking when she was called to her father's bedside because of the heart attack.|$|E

2500|$|A key {{concept of}} The Glass Bees is {{illustrated}} through the novel’s {{focus on the}} minuscule. Demonstrated both by {{the structure of the}} narrative and through Zapparoni’s forays into nanotechnology, it is seen that it is the minute that has the most meaning and influence in life, not the grand or conspicuous. Zapparoni’s tiny creations are the first lens through which Jünger plays with the theme of miniaturization - the title itself refers to one such creation. [...] The glass bees exemplify how it is the overlooked that often possesses the greatest meaning. At first an unappreciated aspect of Zapparoni’s garden, Richard eventually notices the intricacy and difficulty of creating something so small: “In the beginning, probably it was less difficult to create a whale than a hummingbird,” and comes to acknowledge that {{the true nature of the}} garden is “more significant than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> to me in my first consternation.” As such, the garden acts as a microcosm of the novel’s world: only upon reflection does the true nature and relevance of the overlooked become apparent.|$|E
