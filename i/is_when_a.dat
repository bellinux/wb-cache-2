40|$|The {{existing}} Linux disk schedulers are {{in general}} efficient, {{but we have}} identified two scenarios where we have observed a non-optimal behavior. The first <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> application requires a fixed bandwidth, and the second <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> operation performs a file tree traversal. In this paper, we address both these scenarios and propose solutions which both increase performance. ...|$|R

5|$|A hat-trick in cricket <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> bowler {{takes three}} wickets from {{consecutive}} deliveries. It {{is a relatively}} rare feat, and has occurred eighteen times {{in the history of}} women's international cricket. The first hat-trick was taken in a Test match between Australia and England in February 1958, by Australia's Betty Wilson. The most recent bowler to achieve the feat was the New Zealand off spiner, Anna Peterson, against Australia during a Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|A hat-trick in cricket <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> bowler {{takes three}} wickets on {{consecutive}} deliveries, dismissing three different batsmen. It {{is a relatively}} rare event in One Day International (ODI) cricket with only 43 occurrences in more than 3,800 matches since the first ODI, between Australia and England on 5 January 1971. The first ODI hat-trick was taken by Jalal-ud-Din of Pakistan, playing against Australia in Hyderabad, Sindh in September 1982 and the first world cup hat trick was taken by Chetan Sharma of India against New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> population {{contracts to}} a significantly smaller size over {{a short period}} of time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E

5000|$|Accidental versus Intentional. An {{accidental}} plan conflict <b>is</b> <b>when</b> {{carrying out}} <b>a</b> plan inadvertently prevents another actor from completing its plan. An intentional plan conflict <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> actor carries out a plan, {{knowing that it}} will prevent another actor’s plan from succeeding.|$|R
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for harvest is their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species have {{a range of}} genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform seeds are planted under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, especially when the seeds are mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees and banana plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. Another example <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E
