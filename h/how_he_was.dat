5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis {{had set up}} the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews {{had to give up}} their homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Churchill fully tooled-up—that is, installed, {{assembled}} and made ready for productive use—the Gatling Gun factory {{that opened in}} Birmingham in 1889. This was despite being an undischarged bankrupt. He had formed a partnership with his son, Charles Henry Churchill, and in 1888 he obtained another partner when John William Wright Gabriel disposed of his family's interest in a drugs manufacturer, Gabriel and Troke, and joined the Churchills. This partnership may explain <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to complete the work in Birmingham despite his financial status. Despite the assertion by biographer David Jeremy that J W W Gabriel disposed of the drugs manufacturing interest, a notice in The London Gazette for 1885 shows his father, John Wild Gabriel, ending a partnership with Troke, and that Troke then formed a similar arrangement with another person.|$|E

5|$|Collard relates <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{recruited}} {{into the}} IDSO by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, under whom Collard had worked. The book {{goes on to}} look at the activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.|$|E
5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> motivated {{to work on}} music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad Hatter (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related the story of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding {{did not take the}} man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E

5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF {{have been}} the subject of several films. Some {{examples}} are Swedish football documentaries Blådårar1 and Blådårar2, which portray the club from both supporter and player perspectives during the 1997 and 2000 seasons. Blådårar1 is set in 1997, when the club finished third in Allsvenskan. The film focuses on devoted fan Lasse, player Anders Andersson, former chairman Hans Cavalli-Björkman and other individuals. Blådårar2 is set in 2000, the year after the club had been relegated to Superettan, and follows the team as they fight for Malmö FF's return to Allsvenskan. The second film continues to follow Lasse, but also has a significant focus on Zlatan Ibrahimović, his progress and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eventually sold to AFC Ajax during the 2001 season.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{introduces}} Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator {{who has been a}} vampire for over fifty years. Mick meets Beth Turner, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, {{at the scene of the}} murder of a young woman. Mick and Beth begin investigating the crime together, helping each other to catch the killer. Flashbacks to 22 years ago show a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline Duvall over a kidnapped girl. Mick lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years.

5|$|Æthelberht was put {{to death}} by Offa of Mercia under unclear circumstances; the site of his murder was {{apparently}} the royal vill at Sutton Walls. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was beheaded. Mediaeval sources tell <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken captive whilst visiting his future Mercian bride Ælfthyth and was then murdered and buried. In Richard of Cirencester's account of the murder, which cannot be substantiated, Offa's evil queen Cynethryth poisoned her husband's mind until he agreed to have his guest killed. Æthelberht was then bound and beheaded by a certain Grimbert and his body was unceremoniously disposed of. The mediaeval historian John Brompton's Chronicon describes how the king's detached head fell off a cart into a ditch where it was found, before it restored a blind man's sight. According to the Chronicon, Ælfthyth subsequently became a recluse at Crowland and her remorseful father founded monasteries, gave land to the Church and travelled {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E

A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. The Manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> treated, states that they won't be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around Manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E
