40|$|This book {{introduces}} the theoretical description and properties of quantum fluids. The {{focus is on}} gaseous atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and, to a minor extent, superfluid helium, but the underlying concepts are relevant {{to other forms of}} quantum fluids such as polariton and photonic condensates. The book is pitched at the level of advanced undergraduates and early postgraduate students, aiming to provide the reader with the knowledge and skills to develop their own research project on quantum fluids. Indeed, the content for this book grew from introductory notes provided to our own research students. It is assumed that the reader has prior knowledge of undergraduate mathematics and/or physics; otherwise, the concepts are introduced from scratch, often with references <b>for</b> directed <b>further</b> <b>reading.</b> Comment: 132 pages.

50|$|Reading Benang, {{one could}} see that the {{narration}} could be seen as unreliable. Narration and writing style used are similar to that of stream of consciousness, factual information, history and memories. All of these help compose the complex and sometimes confusing narration of Benang. Writing styles can be compared to the novel Beloved by Toni Morrison, in the way the narrator speaks through his memories or stream of memories and facts. It is difficult to find what the narrator is going <b>for</b> but upon <b>further</b> <b>reading</b> all the memories, thoughts and emotions presenting in this novel finally come together.|$|R

30|$|The primary aim of our {{research}} was to try and establish whether a linear model trained only on a static training set of historical data can have good predictive performance, and if so, to analyze the models {{to find out about}} the structure of the market. In our goal of analyzing the financial models which take historical data as input and produce relatively good performance, we planned to focus on the characteristics and structure of the model being generated. Hence, we decided on SVR with linear kernels to be the choice of technique for generating models, since {{it would be easier to}} analyze a linear model as the parameters would relate to real and observable data values. <b>For</b> <b>further</b> detailed <b>reading</b> and material on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and SVM for Regression (SVR), please refer to [6, 7, 16, 17, 20].|$|R
