40|$|As an {{autonomous}} navigation method, X-ray pulsar navigation can provide position, timing and attitude information for various spacecrafts. Since the X-rays (1 - 20 keV) from the pulsar can not penetrate the earth atmosphere, an X-ray source in laboratory {{needs to be}} set up to test and calibrate the detector. In this paper an arbitrary X-ray pulse source to simulate the neutron pulsar signal is proposed. The main components of the simulation source are a <b>grid</b> <b>controlled</b> X-ray tube and arbitrary pulse generation electronics. With the arbitrary pulse voltage applied to the tube grid, the X-ray intensity is controlled. Through electron optics design, the tube electrode parameters are optimized A <b>grid</b> <b>controlled</b> X-ray tube is fabricated and tested. Using a micro-channel plate detector to detect and reconstruct the generated X-ray pulses, the similarity between the accumulated profile and the original pulsar profile is better than 95 %.

50|$|Another {{use of the}} {{thyratron}} was in relaxation oscillators. Since {{the plate}} turn-on voltage {{is much higher than}} the turn-off voltage the tube has hysteresis and with a capacitor across it could function as a sawtooth oscillator. The voltage on the <b>grid</b> <b>controlled</b> the breakdown voltage and thus the period of oscillation. Thyratron relaxation oscillators were used in power inverters and oscilloscope sweep circuits.|$|R
50|$|A tetrode is {{a vacuum}} tube (called valve in British English) having four active {{electrodes}}. The four electrodes in {{order from the}} centre are: a thermionic cathode, first and second grids and a plate (called anode in British English). There are several varieties of tetrodes, the most common being the screen-grid tube and the beam tetrode. In screen-grid tubes and beam tetrodes, the first <b>grid</b> is the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> and the second grid is the screen grid. In other tetrodes one of the <b>grids</b> is a <b>control</b> <b>grid,</b> while the other may {{have a variety of}} functions.|$|R

50|$|The {{control of}} the grid spacing has not been {{suggested}} till now. Nakamura and Edwards, <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> was accomplished using non uniform spacing. The parabolic grid generation shows an advantage over the hyperbolic grid generation that, no shocks or discontinuities occur and the grid is relatively smooth. The specifications of initial values and selection of step size to control the grid points is however time consuming, but these techniques can be effective when familiarity and experience is gained.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{privatisation}} of the UK electricity {{industry in}} 1989, {{ownership of the}} property passed to the National Grid Company. It was used to house the Leeds <b>Grid</b> <b>Control</b> Centre for the UK's electricity transmission network from 1958 until its operational closure in 1997. Advances in communications technology (including remote substation operation) during this period reduced the requirement for regional control centres. By {{the time of its}} operational closure in 1997, the entire electricity transmission network in England and Wales could be controlled from a single control room anywhere in the country. Later used as a control centre, it performed as one of the control centres for the Dinorwig hydroelectric storage facility in North Wales.|$|E

5000|$|Today, Dinorwig is {{operated}} not to help meet peak loads {{but as a}} STOR (Short Term Operating Reserve), providing a fast response to short-term rapid changes in power demand or sudden loss of power stations.

5000|$|At {{the centre}} was the National Control Room of the National Grid in London, which {{was part of}} the control {{hierarchy}} for the system. There were also both area and district <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> rooms, which were originally at Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, St Albans, East Grinstead and Bristol. The shift control engineers who worked in these control rooms would cost, schedule and load dispatch an economic commitment of generation to the main interconnected system (the 400/275/132kV network) at an adequate level of security. They also had information about the running costs and availability of every power producing plant in England and Wales. They constantly anticipated demand, monitored and instructed power stations to increase, reduce or stop electricity production. They used what was known as the [...] "merit order", a ranking of each generator in power stations based upon how much they cost to produce electricity. The objective was to ensure that electricity production was achieved at the lowest possible cost.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1963; its total {{electrical}} capacity was 720 MW comprising six 120 MW generating units. A 120 MW Unit comprised a coal-fired (later oil-fired) boiler supplying high-pressure steam to a GEC three-cylinder reheat steam turbine, {{which in turn}} powered a hydrogen-cooled 120 MW alternator. Each unit had its own control room interposed between the boiler and turbine manned by a unit operator and an assistant unit operator. They in turn were assisted by two auxiliary plant attendants, one for the boiler, the other for the turbine plant. The electrical output of each unit, and therefore the station, was co-ordinated by a single load dispatch office who were in contact with <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> at East Grinstead. The electrical output of the station was routed by cables and overhead conductors to two grid sub stations, Northfleet East and Northfleet West, where the station fed the national grid. At full load each boiler consumed 50 tonnes of coal per hour, which was delivered by ship, first to a coal yard then to bunkers that fed cylindrical ball mills to create pulverised fuel, which was then blown into the boiler furnace. The steam conditions were 510 Â°C at 1500 psi. The design of this station can be considered the founding development of ever larger boiler / turbine units. As a coal-burning station, it was converted to burn oil in the early 1970s. The station closed in 1991.In 2000 the Government gave permission to Scottish and Southern Energy plc to build a 110 MW gas-fired {{combined heat and power}} station to supply the heat and electricity needs of the Kimberly-Clark paper mill at Northfleet.|$|E

40|$|Electric {{power grid}} {{complexity}} is growing rapidly as {{we attempt to}} support technical, business, and societal goals for which power grids were not originally designed. To ensure grid stability and {{have the ability to}} remain reliable under highly dynamic destabilizing conditions requires that <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> systems evolve in ways that address transformational changes and the resultant operational problems. Ultra-large scale power system control architecture - a macro architecture for <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> that handles multi-objective, multi-constraint problems in a framework that can support coordinated control across utility organizational boundaries and, potentially, prosumer premises. The keys to this approach are three-fold: rectify the macro-structure of <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> to eliminate the emerging chaos; introduce two-axis distributed control; apply multi-level hierarchical optimization tools to <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> design. This paper describes emerging issues in <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> and provides reasons why the present path of <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> evolution is problematic and presents an ultra-large scale architecture for <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> that can solve today's problems and those expected over the next 30 years...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} grid-controlled extraction for a laser {{ion source}} using a KrF laser.
