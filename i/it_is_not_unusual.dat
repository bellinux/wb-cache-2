Luidia ciliaris has seven arms, members of the Solasteridae have ten to fifteen while the Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have up to fifty. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> in species that {{typically}} have five arms for some individuals to possess six or more through abnormal development.|$|E

5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> for the service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include Edgar Allan Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E

5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> for a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves {{in order to be}} regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

25|$|Washington and Lee's honor {{system does}} not have a list of rules that define {{punishable}} behavior—beyond the traditional guide of the offenses lying, cheating or stealing.

25|$|After {{the growth}} period, when the meristems are dormant, {{the leaves are}} sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing seed-bearing organs (such as fruit) are always sinks. Because of this {{multi-directional}} flow, coupled {{with the fact that}} sap cannot move with ease between adjacent sieve-tubes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> for sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.|$|E
