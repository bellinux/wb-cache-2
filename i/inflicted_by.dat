5|$|The enemy {{made many}} {{attempts}} to encircle the regiment, {{but each time}} they failed because of the many casualties <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> the 65th. Because the 65th held their positions, that enabled the U.S. Marines {{to withdraw from the}} Chosin Reservoir on December 1950.|$|E

5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem {{because of the lack}} of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E
5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} {{combat operations}} {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign during the Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> previous strikes and to scout targets for other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency {{calculated}} that the Allied naval bombardments {{and other forms of}} attack other than bombing had caused 3,282 casualties, representing 0.5 percent of all casualties <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> the Allies in the Japanese home islands. The casualties attributed to naval bombardments and other causes included 1,739 fatalities, 46 persons who were still classified as missing and 1,497 people who were wounded.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, an Indian {{family court}} in Mumbai {{ruled that a}} husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she had been killed by an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues {{said in an interview that}} the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the wounds}} <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> the blast were {{permanently}} debilitating, {{such as those}} caused by flying glass or by the flash of the explosion. Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly {{in the path of}} glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.|$|E

5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> machetes or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt. He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E

It was where the Satya Yuga reached its pinnacle. Prithu liberated his father Vena, from the hell called Pūt, hence all sons are called Putras. Practicing detachment, Prithu ruled according to the Vedas and the Dandaneeti.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a hiatus from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the other}} {{categories}} are structural violence, symbolic violence, and violence enacted by the government through laws or actions. Structural violence occurs when {{the structure of a}} society causes the violence. Examples of this include laws that create unequal access to public amenities or affect different citizens based on their status in society. Symbolic violence concerns socially accepted norms that are ingrained over time such as the roles of different classes, genders and ethnic groups. Finally political violence addresses the harm the government can <b>inflict</b> <b>by</b> their actions either through neglect or action. All of these forms of violence can also be characterized in urbicide.|$|R

5|$|The Crusaders' main home {{ground was}} the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch. However, they stopped playing {{there during the}} 2011 Super Rugby season due to damage <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> the February Christchurch earthquake.

Previous venues included Trafalgar Park in Nelson, and Alpine Energy Stadium in Timaru.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{launched}} a renewed effort {{to push through}} to Amiens on 5 April, two armies attacking {{across the front of}} the British Third Army. The New Zealanders experienced a heavy bombardment which began at 5:00am which cut off communications and later that day suffered two separate but disorganised attacks by infantry. The first was fended off but the second recaptured La Signy farm. An attempt to push on to the main trenches of the New Zealanders was rebuffed with heavy losses <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> the Wellington Company of the Machine Gun Battalion.|$|E

Edie soon takes Susan to a Hooters-type restaurant and accuses a waitress of being slutty. A fight soon ensues and Susan is forced to intervene when Edie is attacked by several waitresses. The following day, Edie thanks Susan for helping her and alerts her that she has hired a detective to learn who Karl has been spending his time with {{and not to be}} alarmed.|$|R
60|$|We {{are all of}} us imaginative in {{some form}} or other, for images are the brood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way in which others cajoled themselves, did not escape the {{fellowship}} of illusion. In writing the programme for his burial he certainly did not make clear to himself that his pleasure in the little drama of which it formed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the vexations he could <b>inflict</b> <b>by</b> the rigid clutch of his dead hand, he inevitably mingled his consciousness with that livid stagnant presence, and so far as he was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of gratification inside his coffin. Thus old Featherstone was imaginative, after his fashion.|$|R

5|$|The harm <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> cookiecutter sharks {{on fishing}} nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} and develop in any {{geographic}} location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes.

Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly <b>inflicted</b> <b>by</b> downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation.
