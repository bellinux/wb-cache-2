They transmigrate through the permeability of the soil and arrive into this pit where they find their way to come out in the air.

Following the announcement of the planned closure of the settlement, Romani rights organizations such as Associazione 21 luglio and the European Roma Rights Centre condemned plans to forcibly relocate the community to a new segregated camp, with Associazione 21 luglio expressing particular concern over the potential creation of a larger segregated [...] "mega-camp" [...] where further social marginalization could take place. On June 21, 2016, the entire camp, consisting of 75 families numbering approximately 300 residents, was forcibly evicted without written notice and relocated to a new camp in an industrial area near Giugliano. The new site is located at a former fireworks factory, which was destroyed in a 2015 explosion. According to human rights observers, the secluded site, which is surrounded by wild vegetation on three sides and a wall, is contaminated with what appears to be asbestos and unidentified potentially explosive substances, and is littered with sharp objects that pose a danger to children. Residents were not given any say in selecting a new site, and faced homelessness if they did not move to the new camp, which does not have any housing, sewerage, electricity, or adequate water supply. As of February 2016, the Ministry of Interior and Region Campania have secured funding for a new permanent, segregated replacement site with 44 prefabricated dwellings. No funding has been committed for <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> such as education, health, employment, or community programs, prompting the European Roma Rights Centre to describe the plan as [...] "a long term plan for segregation".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology to analyse total system costs and CO 2 emission consequences for energy efficiency measures at a process plant when biofuels are saved and {{sold on the}} energy market. Process <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> and energy market scenarios are linked for a rational treatment of for example electricity prices, fuel prices, and policy instruments. Promising process <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> are analysed using a set of energy scenarios in order to cover different possible future developments. For each scenario marginal biomass utilisation and marginal electricity production is identified, assuming that a process integration measure is a distortion to the baseline defined by each scenario. The scenarios used emanate from a large energy market model covering the Nordic countries from 1995 to 2050. The methodology is applied to a pulp plant located in Sweden. Results show that there are several options to find in-house process <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> at pulp mills to increase biofuel market supply at competitive costs. Even so, CO 2 emission consequences for the measures are very dependent on scenario used. In some cases CO 2 emissions may even increase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Central to {{the space}} syntax method (a {{technique}} for morphological analysis of urban areas) {{is the concept of}} integration. Unfortunately, the integration values are not independent of the size of urban areas. Consequently it is difficult to compare areas of different size, implying a need for standardisation of <b>integration</b> <b>measures.</b> In this paper three such standardised <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> are discussed. The properties of these measures are simulated for differently sized urban areas, with the assumption of a spatial structure with morphological constants. The results of these simulations suggest that a measure based on a comparison with an 'axial grid ' has most desirable properties.

40|$|Pulp mills use {{significant}} amounts of biofuels, both internal and purchased. Biofuels could contribute to reach greenhouse gas emission targets at competitive costs. Implementing process <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> at a pulp mill {{in order to achieve}} pulp production with less use of energy (biofuels) has not only on-site consequences but also off-site consequences, such as substitution of fossil fuels elsewhere by the saved pulp mill biofuels, and less on-site electric power generation. In this paper a method, a linking model, is suggested to analyse pulp mill biofuel saving measures when carbon dioxide (CO 2) external costs are internalised. The linking model is based on equilibrium economics and links information from CO 2 constrained energy market future scenarios with process <b>integration</b> <b>measures.</b> Pulp mill economics and marginal energy market CO 2 response are identified. In an applied study, four process <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> at a Swedish pulp mill were analysed using five energy market future scenarios emanating from a Nordic energy model. The investigated investment alternatives for biofuel savings all result in positive net annual savings, irrespectively of the scenario used.

Social <b>integration</b> <b>measures</b> included social support, closeness with family members and friends, attachment to the black gay community, openness about sexuality within religious communities, and MSM social network size.
