5|$|In 2002, Sony {{released}} the first useful and fully functioning operating {{system for a}} video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a network adapter to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors {{as well as a}} USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2.|$|E
2500|$|Expansion {{capabilities}} {{new to the}} Amiga line {{were the}} PCMCIA Type II slot and the internal 44-pin ATA interface both most commonly seen on laptop computers. Both interfaces are controlled by the 'Gayle' custom chip. The A600 has internal housing for one 2.5" [...] <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive connecting to the ATA controller.|$|E
2500|$|The Amiga 600, {{also known}} as the A600 (codenamed [...] "June Bug" [...] after a B-52s song), is a home {{computer}} that was introduced at the CeBIT show in March 1992. The A600 is Commodore International's final model based on the Motorola 68000 CPU and the ECS chipset. It is essentially a redesign of the Amiga 500 Plus, with the option of an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive and a PCMCIA port. A notable aspect of the A600 is its small size. Lacking a numeric keypad, the A600 is only slightly larger than a standard PC keyboard (14" [...] wide by 9.5" [...] long by 3" [...] high and weighing approximately 6 pounds). It shipped with AmigaOS 2.0, which was generally considered more user-friendly than earlier versions of the operating system.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E

5000|$|The Cromemco Z-2H {{computer}} {{was based on}} the Z-2D, but in addition had an 11 megabyte <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive. [...] While the Z-2 and Z-2D had 21 S-100 slots, the Z-2H was limited to 12 expansion slots due {{to the size of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b> Over 1000 Z-2H systems were sold in the first six months on the market. The 11-megabyte hard disks were also offered as a separate unit, the HDD, that could be used with a Z-2D computer. The HDD came with either one or two hard disks, for up to 22 megabytes of storage.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{principles}} of MythTV distributions and GeeXboX, Kodibuntu is designed to simplify a permanent installation of Kodi onto a computer {{to be used as}} a dedicated home theater PC in the living-room, as such the user can directly install XBMC from the bootable CD to either a USB flash drive or to an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive as it comes with a complete instant-on (Linux kernel-based) embedded operating system. When installed onto a USB flash drive or <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive, Kodibuntu has the ability to save settings and make updates to XBMC and the operating-system back onto the USB flash drive or hard disk drive that it is installed onto.|$|E
50|$|Mass storage {{options are}} either 91 or 327 MB <b>internal</b> SCSI <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> and a 1.4 MB 3.5 in floppy drive. A storage {{expansion}} box that holds two more disks can be mounted {{to the top}} of the chassis.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, laptop {{computers}} were becoming popular among business people. The COMPAQ SLT/286 debuted in October 1988, being the first battery-powered laptop to support an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive and a VGA compatible LCD screen. It weighed 14 lbs.|$|E
50|$|The Amiga {{helped to}} create and launch digital {{recorders}} coupled with an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> and a DVD drive for file transfer. One was Broadcaster Elite, {{one of the first}} digital video recorders, based on a SCSI system and a Zorro II Amiga expansion card.|$|E
50|$|From {{the debut}} of the Macintosh 128K through the Macintosh Plus, various {{third-party}} cooling add-ons were available to help increase airflow through the unit. Apple reorganized the compact Macintosh case to accommodate a fan {{with the release of}} the Macintosh SE, which included a heat-generating <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Fuel {{has four}} 64-bit 3.3V PCI slots for expansion, {{two of which}} run at 33 MHz and two of which run at 66 MHz. The system also has two {{internal}} Ultra160 SCSI busses, with space for two internal 5.25" [...] devices and three <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disks.</b> The Fuel usually shipped with 10,000 rpm SCSI disks, but it can take good advantage of 15,000 rpm models, with sustained bandwidths up to three times faster than is possible with Octane2's internal UW bus. The Fuel {{was also the first}} SGI system to support USB devices in IRIX, although audio and HID USB devices were the only ones supported.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{firmware}} {{is officially}} user-upgradable, {{since it is}} a Linux-based computer, as opposed to third-party [...] "patching" [...] of alternate receivers. All units support Dream's own DreamCrypt conditional access (CA) system, with software-emulated CA Modules (CAMs) available for many alternate CA systems. The built-in Ethernet interface allows networked computers to access the recordings on the <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> on some Dreambox models. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB MPEG transport streams on distributed file systems or broadcast the streams as IPTV to VideoLAN and XBMC Media Center clients. Unlike many PC based PVR systems that use free-to-air type of DVB receiver cards, the built-in conditional access allows receiving and storing encrypted content.|$|R
50|$|This unit is {{essentially}} an updated EVA8000. No big new file format support is added or needed, but the main addition is an <b>internal</b> 500GB <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> allowing for playback of content {{without the need for}} a computer, NAS or attached USB hard drive. At least one of these is required for the EVA700 and EVA8000 to play back content other than live over the internet. The <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> drive also buffers streaming content if desired.|$|R
50|$|The first camcorders {{that used}} MOD format {{appeared}} in 2003. JVC introduced the Everio GZ-MG30, which recorded directly to an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive. Panasonic unveiled the SDR-S100, which recorded to SD cards. The encoding scheme, data rate, frame rate and frame size closely matched parameters of DVD-video.|$|E
50|$|Since it {{was deemed}} that no user would {{ever want to}} operate a {{computer}} without at least one floppy disk drive, the hard disk controller was only configured to operate a single <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b> An external hard disk expansion port was available, but compatible external hard disks were never produced.|$|E
50|$|The PC Convertible had {{expansion}} capabilities {{through a}} proprietary ISA bus-based port {{on the rear}} of the machine. Extension modules, including a small printer and a video output module, could be snapped into place. The machine could also take an internal modem, but {{there was no room for}} an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early PC/ATs were {{plagued with}} {{reliability}} problems, {{in part because}} of some software and hardware incompatibilities, but mostly related to the <b>internal</b> 20 MB <b>hard</b> <b>disk,</b> and High Density Floppy Disk Drive.|$|R
5000|$|HyperDrive {{was unusual}} because the {{original}} Macintosh {{did not have}} any <b>internal</b> interface for <b>hard</b> <b>disks.</b> It was attached directly to the CPU, and ran about seven times faster than Apple's [...] "Hard Disk 20", an external <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> that attached to the floppy disk port.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{firmware}} {{is officially}} user-upgradable, {{since it is}} a Linux-based computer, as opposed to third-party [...] "patching" [...] of alternate receivers. Firmware is based on Enigma 2, which was originally designed for Dreambox by Dream Multimedia. All units support Conax conditional access (CA) system, with software-emulated conditional-access modules (CAMs) available for many alternate CA systems. The built-in Ethernet interface allows networked computers to access the recordings on the <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> and stream live picture from the tuners. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB MPEG transport streams on networked filesystems or broadcast the streams as IPTV to VideoLAN and XBMC Media Center clients. Unlike many PC based PVR systems that use free-to-air type of DVB receiver cards, the built-in conditional access allows receiving and storing encrypted content.|$|R
50|$|The Macintosh II had drive bays for an <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> (originally 40 MB or 80 MB) and an {{optional}} second floppy disk drive. It, {{along with the}} Macintosh SE, was the first Macintosh computer to use the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) introduced with the Apple IIGS for keyboard and mouse interface.|$|E
5000|$|Expansion {{capabilities}} {{new to the}} Amiga line {{were the}} PCMCIA Type II slot and the internal 44-pin ATA interface both most commonly seen on laptop computers.

50|$|Akai S2000 is a {{stripped}} down, economic {{version of}} s3000XL featuring only 2x16 character LCD display, no internal SCSI connector fitted and was usually sold with no options installed. Regardless, it is functionally identical and accepts the S3000XL options listed below (sans <b>internal</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk)</b> also including the IB-208P 8-channel output board, standard in S3000XL.|$|E
50|$|The MEGA STE {{is based}} on STE hardware. Physically, the 2 MB and 4 MB models shipped with a high {{resolution}} mono monitor, and an <b>internal</b> SCSI <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> (the 1 MB model included neither a monitor, <b>hard</b> <b>disk,</b> nor <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> controller). Despite offering better ST compatibility than the TT, it also included a number of TT features, from the ST-grey version of the TT case with separate keyboard and system unit, optional FPU, a VMEbus slot, two extra RS232 ports (all 9-pin rather than 25-pin as previous models had), a LocalTalk/RS-422 port (no AppleTalk software was ever produced) and a 1.44 MB HD floppy support. Support for a third/middle mouse button was included, too.|$|R
50|$|Optional {{hardware}} includes DualShock or DualShock 2 controllers, a PS2 DVD remote control, an <b>internal</b> {{or external}} <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive (HDD), a network adapter, {{horizontal and vertical}} stands, PlayStation or PS2 memory cards, the multitap for PlayStation or PS2, a USB motion camera (EyeToy), a USB keyboard and mouse, and a headset.|$|R
50|$|USB or FireWire {{connections}} are typically used to attach consumer class external hard drives to a computer. Unlike SCSI, eSATA, or SAS these require circuitry {{to convert the}} <b>hard</b> <b>disk's</b> native signal to the appropriate protocol. Parallel ATA and <b>internal</b> Serial ATA <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> are frequently connected to such chassis because nearly all computers {{on the market today}} have USB or FireWire ports, and these chassis are inexpensive and easy to find.|$|R
