25|$|British {{engineers}} quickly began {{digging in}} batteries on the hornwork hill, the first battery was finished on 22 September but {{hoping to get}} lucky again, Wellington ordered {{an attack on the}} night of 22/23 September before his guns had fired a shot. Men of the 1st and 6th Divisions rushed forward against the palisades with axes, followed by men with just five ladders to scale the 24 <b>foot</b> <b>wall,</b> they failed to receive the support of other troops and were easily repelled with 150 of the 400 men killed and wounded. The engineers then began digging a mine 60 feet to get under the fort's west wall. When this was detonated {{in the early hours of}} the 29 September, part of the wall collapsed, the advanced party of British dashed forward but were not supported and were soon driven back from the defences. It turned out that the mine was run under an ancient buried wall that was in front of the modern wall. Consequently, the main French defenses were unscathed by the explosion.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1999 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} in Nantou County, Taiwan, little information {{was available for}} estimating ground motion that resulted from large (greater than M7) thrust earthquakes, and whether the values seen in that event are commonplace remains unresolved. Foam rubber modeling, numerical modeling, and field {{studies have shown that}} intense ground motions close to 1g are possible on the [...] hanging wall side of the fault during some large thrust earthquakes. A common occurrence of shattered rock that has been observed on the hanging wall of thrust faults reinforces the existence of the strong motions, but precarious rock surveys have indicated that smaller ground motions are present on the <b>foot</b> <b>wall</b> side of the fault. Foam rubber modelling studies confirm that the ground motion on the <b>foot</b> <b>wall</b> side can be lower by a factor of up to five, and an example of this imbalance was displayed during the September 1999 M7.6 {{earthquake in}} Taiwan.|$|E

On the <b>foot</b> <b>wall</b> side, many precarious and semi-precarious rock formations were observed and allowed for peak ground acceleration to be estimated at [...]5g (within a kilometer of the fault trace) while rock shattering and a lack of precarious rocks on the hanging wall side suggested a value near 1g had been experienced {{at the time of the}} shock.|$|E

40|$|Graduation thesis {{consists}} of three parts. The first part is theoretical. General facts about shallow and deep foundations are presented {{with an emphasis on}} shallow foundations. Pocket foundations are explained in detail. The calculation of stresses below footing slab under different types of loads is given. In the second part the procedure for design of pocket foundation is explained. Two examples of design of pocket foundations are presented: pocket foundation with flat inner surface of <b>footing</b> <b>wall</b> and pocket foundation with ribbed inner surface of <b>footing</b> <b>wall.</b> The first step in designing pocket foundations is to determine the stresses under footing slab. Stresses depend on the size of footing slab, type of loading and type of ground soil The calculated stresses must be within allowable stresses in grounds. Stresses define the dimensions of footing slab or actions needed to implement the soil. Next step is to determine the bending and shear reinforcement in footing slab. The type of inner surface on <b>footing</b> <b>wall</b> has a great influence on the amount of reinforcement. Example shows that the needed shear reinforcement in a pocket foundation with flat inner wall surface is bigger than in foundation with ribbed surface. Next step is to determine the horizontal and vertical reinforcement in <b>footing</b> <b>wall.</b> As an example a reinforcement drawing of pocket footing is presented. The drawing was made in a computer program for drawing reinforcement drawings Armcad 2000. In the last part a computer program for designing pocket footings is explained. The program was written in a computer software C Sharp and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. The program designs the pocket foundation and calculates needed reinforcement...|$|R
60|$|At {{one spot}} was a hollow trench or dry ditch leading towards an {{outhouse}} which intervened between the locusts and the garden. No storming party was detailed {{to carry the}} point. Where the numbers were so vast as to cover the whole country, that was needless. They marched in columns, and the columns that chanced {{to come up to}} the point voluntarily and promptly undertook the duty. They swarmed into the ditch. Considine and a small Hottentot boy observed the move, and with admirable skill kept the advancing column in check until a fire was kindled in the ditch. It was roused to a pitch of fierce heat that would have satisfied Nebuchadnezzar himself, and was then left, for other points of danger in the walls claimed more vigorous attention. Onward hopped and crawled the enemy and stormed the fire. The leading files were roasted alive, those following tumbled over their dead bodies into the flames. Had the rest wished to take warning by the fate of their comrades--which they did not--they would have found it impossible to escape, for those behind pushed them on. The fire was filled with the dead, overwhelmed by the dying, fairly put out by both, and the victorious army marched over in triumph. Then the outhouse met them, but they scorned to turn aside, although there was a four <b>foot</b> <b>wall,</b> which one might have supposed more practicable. They walked straight up the outhouse and over it, and were triumphantly descending the other side in myriads before they were discovered and met, with shrieks of vengeance, by Mrs Marais.|$|E
60|$|At Aji Bipa the lode runs N. 38º E. (Mag.) in {{the centre}} shaft, and N. 40 E. in the {{southern}} shaft, a sort of fault occurring in the centre shaft. In the northern shaft I should put it at 38º, but from {{the way in which}} the neighbouring rock had cleaved it was difficult to get the strike accurately. The dip is the same in all three shafts, viz. 82º. The lode being so near vertical, it can be clearly traced for the whole depth of the shafts, and is very well defined. The hanging (eastern) wall is highly coloured with iron oxides, and contains many quartz crystals which are through-coloured with the same, and I do not think it at all unlikely that garnets and other gems may be found in it. One or two minute crystals showed a green colour, and might be tourmaline or emerald; but perhaps it was only a surface-colour caused by the presence of copper. The <b>foot</b> <b>wall</b> is very well marked by a strip of whitish yellow clay about an inch in thickness. The rock on both sides of the lode is gold-bearing, and is evidently, as well as the real lode, formed of the debris of old quartz and granites. Talcose flakes are frequent, and in some places it seems to be clearly gneiss. Although with a small plant it might not be profitable to treat this, still with large and suitable machinery it may be made to pay, and the trouble of separating the rich lode from the inferior stone avoided. One remarkable trait in the lode is the manner in which it splits into blocks and slabs, all the faces of the quartz pebbles being cloven in precisely the same plane.|$|E

50|$|Mount Snow {{is made up}} of four {{separate}} mountain areas: Main Face, North Face, Sunbrook, and Carinthia. Main Face can be divided into smaller areas named after its main chairlifts, including Sundance, Ego Alley, Grand Summit, and Canyon. At the base of Main Face is Launch Pad, a learning area adjacent to the main base area's clock tower and ski school. There is also a learning area by the Sundance Lodge. The North Face, fittingly located to the north of Main Face, is home to some of Mount Snow's most advanced terrain. Opposite of the North Face, on the southern face of the mountain, is Sunbrook which offers scenic trails, great on bluebird days. Carinthia, an entirely re-designed mountain face, accessed via Long John and Deer Run, is home to 12 terrain parks hosting 125+ features including a mini-pipe (10 <b>foot</b> <b>walls)</b> and its Legendary Superpipe boasting 18 <b>foot</b> <b>walls.</b> The parks range from expert to beginner level features so there is fun for the whole family.|$|R
