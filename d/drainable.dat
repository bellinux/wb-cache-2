50|$|The dyke was {{constructed}} in the 25 hectare farm of Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kannur in 2007 {{to solve the problem}} of water scarcity. The experience of KVK indicated that subsurface dyke was an efficient barrier to arrest the subsurface flow of water and conserve ground water. The rate of depletion of <b>drainable</b> water in the catchment area due to the typical undulating topography could be efficiently arrested by the dyke. The dyke resulted in the maintenance of higher water table in the catchment area for a longer period of time. There is an existing dug out pond with top length of 12 m, width 8m a depth 5m in the upstream side of the dyke. The pond is the only source of water in the KVK farm. The pond, which usually gets dried up in the summer is now maintaining a high water table throughout the year as the dyke ensures an incessant supply of water to the pond. Weekly data on the ground water level were recorded using water level recorder. The data showed that significantly higher level of water table was maintained in the catchment area (upstream area) compared to down stream area. Taking into account the mean depth of soil as 2 m the catchment area as 1.5ha (the actual area is 15 ha) and the <b>drainable</b> porosity as 10%, the total water storage capacity of the dyke would be 3000 m3. The crops cultivated in the catchment area would be benefited by way of constant capillary feeding of the rhizosphere. Kerala receives, on an average, more than 3000mm of rainfall per annum which is concentrated to the months of June to October. Due to the typical undulating topography of the state, the excess rain received is mostly lost through runoff. Immediately on cessation of rains subsurface water drains off along the slope resulting in poor retention of water in the catchment area. In spite of the heavy rainfall received in Kerala, the state experiences severe drought during summer months due to inefficient utilisation of rain water. In a state like Kerala, where the pressure on land is very high surface storage of water in large reservoirs with their adverse ecological impact is not an economic proposition. Alternatively, structures like subsurface dyke are most ideal for in situ conservation of rainfall received in a watershed.|$|E

Active {{use of these}} SSTs was phased out completely by November 1980, and {{the first step toward}} final disposal of the waste in the SSTs is interim stabilization, which involves removing essentially all of the <b>drainable</b> liquid from the tank. Stabilization can be achieved administratively, by jet pumping to remove <b>drainable</b> interstitial liquid, or by supernatant pumping. To date, 116 tanks have been declared interim stabilized; 44 SSTs have had <b>drainable</b> liquid removed by salt well jet pumping.

40|$|Storage {{of water}} within a river basin is often {{estimated}} by analyzing recession flow curves as it cannot be `instantly' estimated {{with the aid}} of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of `drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the `complete' recession flow curve (i. e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that recession curves are rarely `complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the wellknown Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q : -dQ/dt = kQ(alpha). However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis {{is that it is not}} suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute alpha considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when alpha >= 2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, alpha is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for <b>drainable</b> storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete recession curves from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted <b>drainable</b> storage matches well with observed <b>drainable</b> storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate <b>drainable</b> storage for `incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.

40|$|The Hanford Site has 149 single-shell tanks (SSTs) {{containing}} {{radioactive waste}} {{that is a}} complex mix of radioactive and chemical products. Of these, 67 are known or suspected to have leaked liquid into the surrounding soil, while 82 are considered sound (Hanlon 1999). To minimize the amount of material that potentially could leak into the surrounding soil, all of the SSTs are scheduled to have <b>drainable</b> liquid removed and to be designated as interim stabilized. Of the SSTs, 119 have been declared stabilized, and only 30 require further processing (Hanlon 1999). Many of the tanks have been declared stabilized administratively, with only 45 tanks having had <b>drainable</b> liquid removed. The pending consent decree between the Washington State Department of Ecology and the Office of River Protection. (U. S. District Court Eastern District of Washington, 1999) sets a milestone to complete interim stabilization by September 2004. While process equipment exists for removing <b>drainable</b> liquid, and its operation is well known from previous pumping campaigns, a number of safety issues associated with the release and potential ignition of flammable gases within the tanks needs to be addressed. The safety concerns associated with flammable gases stem from the observation {{that some of the}} waste in the SSTs generates and retains hazardous quantities of flammable gases, including hydrogen, nitrous oxide, and ammonia. Of the 30 SSTs remaining to be declared interim stabilized, 29 need to have <b>drainable</b> liquid removed by saltwell pumping (waste in tank 241 -C- 106 will be removed by sluicing), and 16 of these are on the Flammable Gas Watch List (FGWL) (Hopkins 1995; Hanlon 1999). Most of these tanks are in Facility Group 2 (Noorani 1997); that is, it is believed that tank operations may induce the release of significant quantities of flammable gas, but gas release does not occur spontaneously. In particular, saltwell pumping to remove the interstitial liquid from SSTs is expected to cause the release of much of the retained gas, both insoluble (principally hydrogen) and soluble (principally ammonia), posing a number of safety concerns (Peurrung et al. 1997; Meader 1996) ...|$|E

40|$|Kuttanad, the low-lying tract in Kerala State (South-west India), is {{a region}} where excess water has caused the {{agricultural}} production to remain low. This is even more severe in the potential acid sulphate soils of Kuttanad. Besides the problems inherent to these soils, the region also experiences floods, lack of fresh water and intrusion of saline water from the Arabian Sea. A subsurface drainage system consisting of 10 cm diameter clay tiles, each of 60 cm length, was installed in a pilot area to study the effect of drainage in alleviating the problems faced by these soils. The drains were installed {{at a depth of}} about 1 m with spacings of 15 m (replicated 5 times with a drain length of 75 m) and 30 m (replicated twice with a drain length of 100 m) in order determine the drainage parameters from the field data. The paper discusses on the evaluation of drainage parameters from field data obtained from a pilot area where subsurface drainage system was installed and the use these parameters for designing larger drainage systems. This particular study pertains to the polders of Kuttanad where the fields are always surrounded by water bodies. With the collected drain outflow and water table subsidence data, the drainage parameters namely the hydraulic conductivity and the <b>drainable</b> porosity were determined. A study conducted in subsurface drained field has shown that the hydraulic conductivity values were comparatively higher for the topsoil in the experimental area. It varied directly with the mid-spacing water table height for drains close to the outside water body and exponentially for drains away from the outside water body. The transition in the mode of variation took place at a distance of 60 m from the water body. The values also showed a decreasing trend with the distance of the field from the water body for the same mid-spacing water table heights. The average equivalent hydraulic conductivity computed was 0. 167 m/d for regions up to 60 m from the water body and 0. 055 m/d for regions beyond that. For areas near to outside water bodies, the <b>drainable</b> porosity increased as the mid-spacing water table height decreased. For areas that are away from the water bodies, the <b>drainable</b> porosity decreased with the mid-spacing water table height and became almost constant at lower mid-spacing water table heights.

40|$|Determination of {{overland}} {{sheet flow}} depths, velocities and celerities across the hillslope in watershed modeling is important towards estimation of surface storage, travel times to streams and soil detachment rates. It requires careful {{characterization of the}} flow processes. Similarly, determination of the temporal variation of hillslope-riparian-stream hydrologic connectivity requires estimation of the shallow subsurface soil hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention (i. e., <b>drainable</b> porosities) parameters. Field rainfall and runoff simulation studies provide considerable information and insight into these processes; in particular, that sheet flows are likely laminar and that shallow hydraulic conductivities and storage can be determined from the plot studies. Here, using a 1 m by 2 m long runoff simulation flume, we found that for overland flow rates per unit width of roughly 30 – 60 mm 2 /s and bedslopes of 10 %– 66 % with varying sand roughness depths that all flow depths were predicted by laminar flow equations alone and that equivalent Manning’s n values were depth dependent and quite small relative to those used in watershed modeling studies. Even for overland flow rates greater than those typically measured or modeled and using Manning’s n values of 0. 30 – 0. 35, often assumed in physical watershed model applications for relatively smooth surface conditions, the laminar flow velocities were 4 – 5 times greater, while the laminar flow depths were 4 – 5 times smaller. This observation suggests that travel times, surface storage volumes and surface shear stresses associated with erosion across the landscape would be poorly predicted using turbulent flow assumptions. Filling the flume with fine sand and conducting runoff studies, {{we were unable to}} produce sheet flow, but found that subsurface flows were onflow rate, soil depth and slope dependent and <b>drainable</b> porosities were only soil depth and slope dependent.
