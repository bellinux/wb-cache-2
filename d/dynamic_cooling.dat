40|$|An {{excessive}} {{cold tongue}} {{error in the}} equatorial Pacific has prevailed in several generations of climate models. However, the causes of this problem remain a mystery, partly owing to uncertainty and/or a lack of observational datasets. Based on the multimodel ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5), this study introduces a novel intermodel approach to identify the bias source by going beyond comparison with observational datasets. Intermodel statistics show that the excessive cold tongue bias could {{be traced back to}} a too strong oceanic <b>dynamic</b> <b>cooling</b> linked to a too shallow thermocline along the equatorial Pacific. A heat budget analysis suggests that the excessive oceanic <b>dynamic</b> <b>cooling</b> is balanced by the surface latent heat flux (LHF) adjustment. This is consistent with a variety of oceanic and atmospheric observations but at odds with the popular objectively analyzed air-sea heat fluxes (OAFlux) products. Further analyses suggest an alarming overestimation of OAFlux net surface heat flux (Q(net)) into the tropical Pacific, mainly ascribed to observational uncertainly in air specific humidity. Implications for intermodel statistics in assessing model processes, validating observational data, and regulating future climate projections are discussed...|$|E

Using the EUV 304 ˚A images from the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescope on the Solar TErrestrial RElation Observatory (STEREO) and the Ca II filtergrams from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) instrument on HINODE, we study the evolution of an EUV arch and the kinematics of cool coronal structures. The EUV 304 ˚A observations show that a missile-like plasmoid moves along an arch-shaped trajectory, with an average velocity of 31 km s − 1. About three hours later, a plasma arch forms along the trajectory, subsequently the top part of the arch fades away and disappears, meanwhile the plasma belonging to the two legs of the arch flows downward to the arch feet. During the arch formation and disappearance, SOT Ca II images explore <b>dynamic</b> <b>cool</b> coronal structures beneath the arch. By tracking these structures, we classify them into two types. Type I is threadlike in shape and flows downward with a greater average velocity of 72 km s − 1, finally it combines a loop fibril at chromospheric altitude. Type II is shape-transformable and sometimes rolling as it flows downward with a smaller velocity of 37 km s − 1, then disappears insularly in the chromosphere.

Objective To determine whether lower fluence and shorter cooling duration of the 1, 450 -nm diode laser improve acne effectively with minimal PIH in darker skin. Materials and Methods Twenty-six subjects (skin phototypes IV-V) with inflammatory facial acne received four treatments using the 1, 450 -nm diode laser with 6 -mm spot size 3 to 4 weeks apart. We used three passes with a fluence of 8 J/cm 2 with <b>dynamic</b> <b>cooling</b> of 25 ms to minimize PIH. Serial blinded assessment of acne lesion counts and sebum measurement were evaluated before and up to 6 months after treatment. Results Four weeks and 6 months after the last treatment, reduction of mean acne lesions was 29 % (p<. 01) and 40 % (p<. 03), respectively, from baseline in the group with moderate acne. Significant improvements of sebum production were noted. Four episodes of temporary PIH (3. 8 %) were observed out of all treatment sessions.

40|$|Chondrites are {{samples from}} {{undifferentiated}} asteroids that contain components that {{formed in the}} early solar system. One of the components found in chondrites is chondrules, which are small igneous spherules that formed from the melting of precursor dust ball assemblages during very short, high-temperature events in the solar nebula. Chondrules typically contain olivine and pyroxene, a glassy mesostasis, Fe-Ni metal, and sulfides. Type I chondrules contain FeO-poor and volatile-poor mineral assemblages. Approximately 10 % of type I chondrules, including type IA, IAB, and IB textures, also contain igneous plagioclase. While <b>dynamic</b> <b>cooling</b> experiments have put constraints on the formation conditions of chondrules based on olivine and pyroxene textures and morphologies, plagioclase has not been produced in previous experimental chondrule analogs. In this study, we investigated common chondrule textures in CO chondrites and determined mineral and bulk compositions for plagioclase-bearing type I chondrules in CO chondrites. We also performed one-atmosphere <b>dynamic</b> <b>cooling</b> experiments {{in order to establish}} formation conditions for type I chondrules. We attempted to optimize conditions for plagioclase nucleation and growth by conducting experiments at slow cooling rates, low quench temperatures, {{in the presence of a}} Na-rich atmosphere, and with anorthite seeds present in the starting material. Experimental run products closely resemble textures of type I chondrules in ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites. Olivine is commonly poikilitically enclosed in euhedral low-Ca pyroxene. Ca-pyroxene appears as overgrowths on larger low-Ca pyroxene grains. Compositions of olivine, pyroxene, and mesostasis from experimental charges are also very similar to those observed in natural chondrules. Therefore, peak temperatures (1500 - 1600 °C) and slow cooling rates (5 - 25 °C/hr) used are plausible conditions for type I chondrule formation. These conditions are also predicted by the shock wave model for chondrule formation. While our experiments were conducted at conditions that we considered optimized for plagioclase crystallization, plagioclase was not observed in any experiment. Defining the conditions necessary for plagioclase nucleation may place important constraints on chondrule thermal histories.

Our framework introduces <b>dynamic</b> <b>cooling</b> as one of the self-tuning parameters, in addition to supply voltage and clock frequency.

Our framework features three control policies: 1. Progressive-worst-case-aging (PWCA), which assumes worst-case aging at all times; 2. Progressive-onstate-aging (POSA), which estimates aging by tracking active/sleep mode, and then assumes worst-case aging in active mode and long recovery effects in sleep mode; 3.

To the south of the cool core, we find low temperature (~ 3 keV), diffuse ICM gas extending for distances of ~ 50 kpc spatially coincident with previously identified filaments of Hα emission. Gas at similar temperatures is also detected in adjacent regions without any Hα emission. The X-ray gas coincident with the Hα filament has been measured to be cooling spectroscopically at a rate of ~ 1 M[subscript ʘ] yr[superscript - 1], consistent with measurements of the star formation rate in this region as inferred from ultraviolet (UV) observations, suggesting that the star formation in this filament as inferred by its Hα and UV emission can trace its origin to the rapid cooling of dense, X-ray emitting gas. The Hα filament is not a unique site of cooler ICM, however, as ICM at similar temperatures and even higher metallicities not cospatial with Hα emission is observed just to the west of the Hα filament, suggesting that it may have been uplifted by A 1795 's central active galaxy.
