5|$|Color Air {{had only}} one seating class, offered no {{on-board}} beverages and had no frequent flyer program or lounges. Color Air had an agreement <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, {{as well as by}} phone and Internet. If bought at a travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of spectators}} had slept on wet {{pavements}} outside the stadium in rainy weather {{on the eve}} of the Test to queue <b>for</b> <b>tickets.</b> Bradman had announced his forthcoming retirement at the end of the season, so the public were anxious to witness his last appearance at Test level.|$|E
5|$|The tube station {{became one}} of the {{principal}} shelters during the Blitz. Following heavy raids on the East End on 7 September 1940, many sought refuge underground, and staff opened the gates to everyone at Liverpool Street without asking <b>for</b> <b>tickets.</b> Though technically illegal, it remained the most practical and safe shelter for local residents.|$|E

A public invitation for comments and ideas on topics was issued by the makers of the show.|$|E
5|$|After {{the match}} against Durham, Australia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. Barnes and Tallon {{returned}} from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy weather to queue <b>for</b> <b>tickets.</b> Bradman had already {{announced that he}} would retire {{at the end of the}} season, and the public were anxious to witness his last Test appearance.|$|E
5|$|Although the Luzhniki Stadium had a usual {{capacity}} of almost 85,000 spectators, that {{was reduced to}} 69,500 for the final. Of those tickets, approximately 21,000 were reserved for each finalist club, with a further 10,500 available for purchase {{by the general public}} via the UEFA website. Recipients of those tickets were determined by a random ballot following an online application process that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008. Tickets were available in three categories, priced at €80, €140 and €200 depending on their location in the stadium. UEFA received around 125,000 applications <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> from the general public {{over the course of the}} three-week application process.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{high demand}} and limited {{availability}} of the reserved tickets, some people planned to offer their tickets for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services. Sales offers <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> reached as high as $1,750 each for the reserved standing room section behind the Capitol Reflecting Pool, $5,500 each for the reserved standing room section {{in front of the}} Reflecting Pool and $20,000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds. In one case, a former legislative aide to Representative Ted Poe was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used Craigslist and e‑mail to offer five tickets to the buyer for $4,500.|$|E
5|$|Both stadia had {{approximately}} east-west alignment: the rugby {{ground to}} the north (Castle Street) end; the National Stadium to the south (Wood Street) end. The original capacity was 65,000 but {{this had to be}} reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity would have been much less than Twickenham and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> to major events.|$|E
5|$|Demand <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> by Alabama fans was {{so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

5|$|During the 1952 Winter Olympics, Rødkleiva {{hosted the}} men's slalom and the women's slalom, {{with the other}} events taking place at Norefjell. The {{organizing}} committee had set up 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who did not pay <b>for</b> <b>tickets.</b> The large popularity was to see Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen. Although leading after the first heat, {{he came out of}} balance in the second and finished second behind Austria's Othmar Schneider. The women's race held the following day was won by the American Andrea Mead-Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Riley {{made his}} last tour, making stops {{in most of}} the major cities in the United States. Advertised as his final performances, there was {{incredible}} demand <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program, but found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following {{the announcement of the}} matchup, ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand <b>for</b> <b>tickets,</b> prices in the secondary market plunged.|$|E

5|$|Mughal-e-Azam had {{the widest}} release of any Indian film {{up to that}} time, and patrons often queued all day <b>for</b> <b>tickets.</b> Released on 5 August 1960, it broke box office records in India and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, a {{distinction}} it held for 15 years. By some accounts, Mughal-e-Azam was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, adjusted for inflation. The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards at the 8th Filmfare Awards. Mughal-e-Azam was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured, and the first in any language {{to be given a}} theatrical re-release. The colour version, released in November 2004, was a commercial success.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E

5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E
5|$|The closing {{was criticized}} by two engineers, who {{stated that the}} company {{actually}} made a profit, but ended up paying 24% of their revenue in ticket commission to SJ and NSB. In 2003, the company had a revenue of SEK426.8 million, of which SEK411 million was from ticket sales. The company had a deficit of SEK33.8 million, of which NSB covered SEK8.1 million and SJ SEK25.6 million. However, NSB took a commission of SEK10.8 million and SJ SEK58.5 million. This gave a profit, before provisions, of SEK35.5 million. In comparison, Narvesen took a commission of 2.7% <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> sold by NSB.|$|E
5|$|The high US demand <b>for</b> <b>tickets</b> for the tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced secondary market. Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them straight into the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E
