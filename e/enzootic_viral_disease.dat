40|$|The European {{wild rabbit}} (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a species {{native to the}} Iberian Peninsula, where it was once {{extremely}} abundant. It is considered the most important prey item for the peninsula's assemblage of Mediterranean vertebrate predators, which includes two endangered specialist rabbit feeders, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). However, rabbit population trends in Spain have not been accurately documented. In the present study, we analysed trends in a population of European rabbits monitored over 23 years in the Doñana National Park, {{home to one of}} the most diverse and densest predator communities in Europe. Rabbit abundance and population trends were estimated using roadside counts. Results show that the rabbit population declined sharply by ∼ 60 % during the first wave of epizootic rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1990. Since then, rabbit numbers have declined at a relatively constant rate and the species has become progressively scarcer in the area. The current population is less than 10 % of that before the arrival of RHD. However, after the RHD epizootic we observed increasing intra-annual population recruitment. We hypothesise that density-dependent factors caused by <b>enzootic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diseases</b> (myxomatosis, RHD) and higher predation of rabbits are the main factors preventing recovery of rabbit numbers. The effects of a decline in the prey species on the ecology of sympatric rabbit predators are discussed, and measures to improve ongoing rabbit conservation efforts are suggested. © CSIRO 2007.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the skin and/or mucosa may be either {{a part of a}} systemic <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> or the only manifestation of a <b>viral</b> <b>disease.</b> The former is classified as generalized <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> involving the skin and mucosa and the latter localized <b>viral</b> <b>disease.</b> Since the mucosa serves as the site of entry for the majority of human <b>viral</b> <b>diseases,</b> the mucosal involvement described in this paper will be limited only to a small area of the body accessible by routine physical examination. Because of the easy accessibility, <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> involving the skin and mucosa are often the first ones to be chosen for chemotherapeutic studies of various antiviral agents. As a matter of fact, with a few exceptions, our successful attempts of antiviral chemotherapy have been largely limited to these areas. Thus, a review of chemotherapy of the <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> involving the skin and mucosa practically covers our present knowledge in antiviral chemotherapy in general. Generalized <b>Viral</b> <b>Diseases</b> Involving the Skin and Mucosa Generalized <b>viral</b> <b>diseases</b> involving the skin and mucosa represent a large section of <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> of childhood (Table 1). Clinically, we may classify them into three groups. The first group consists of clinically defined diseases in which the causal virus has been identified. Th...|$|R

40|$|Background: Viruses play {{a leading}} role in human {{pathology}} development, causing a large number of infectious diseases in acute, persistent or chronic forms. Although the number of deaths caused by viral infections have decreased significantly today, they continue to be a significant factor in reducing of the population overall productivity. <b>Viral</b> <b>diseases</b> cause additional losses in community related to the duration of the course or disease or its chronization, increased use of health care, loss of working hours, premature death etc. Introduction of the new antiviral drugs into medical practice is accompanied by the emergence of questions to assess its effectiveness and including into existing clinical protocols. So the aim of this work is the development of methodology of choosing and justification of optimal treatment strategy for <b>viral</b> <b>diseases</b> that could be included into certain clinical protocols for managing patients with certain <b>viral</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methodology justification: The methodology based on the method of pharmacoeconomic analysis "cost of illness", takes into account the economic burden of viral diseases: direct costs for treating of disease, indirect costs related to the disease and intangible costs. Algorithm of treatment scheme choice depends on the cost of treatment for the patient without <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> also as for patient with <b>viral</b> <b>disease.</b> It was proposed to use lower limit priori probability (critical prevalence) of <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> as decision rule in the choice of treatment scheme. Results: Examples of the proposed methodology use show that the choice of the optimal therapeutic scheme for patients with suspected <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> depends on the current prevalence of this disease among patients with similar clinical symptoms of the disease and its cost, depending on the chosen strategy of therapy. The proposed methodology determines the critical level of viral infection prevalence, which comparing to the current prevalence level is the criterion for inclusion of certain antiviral drug into treatment scheme. Conclusions: The implementation of developed methodology requires a dynamic and updated database of patients with similar clinical symptoms, which will include information of etiological agent, chosen treatment scheme, number of bed days and costs associated with <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> for each patient...|$|R
