50|$|The park {{later became}} the base for the American naturalist Dian Fossey to carry out her {{research}} into <b>the</b> <b>gorillas.</b> She arrived in 1967 {{and set up the}} Karisoke Research Centre between Karisimbi and Visoke. From then on she spent most of her time in the park, and is widely credited with saving <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> from extinction by bringing their plight {{to the attention of the}} international community. She was murdered by unknown assailants at her home in 1985, a crime often attributed to the poachers she had spent her life fighting against. Fossey's life later was portrayed on <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen in <b>the</b> film <b>Gorillas</b> in <b>the</b> Mist, named after her autobiography. She is buried in the park in a grave close to the research center, and amongst <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> which became her life.|$|R
