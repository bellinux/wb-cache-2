25|$|George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, won the 2000 Republican presidential {{nomination}} over Arizona Senator John McCain, former Senator <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Dole</b> and others.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} takes {{a rhetorical}} biographical approach in exploring the political life of <b>Elizabeth</b> Hanford <b>Dole.</b> Dole’s {{management of the}} conflicting demands {{of a number of}} tensions through a political style, which was Southern and feminine, was successful early in her career. As a Senator, she took on more serious hard-hitting political issues like the war in Iraq, terrorism, and immigration. During this time, her style was ill-suited to the world of electoral politics. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Dole’s</b> speeches and writings reveal a number of repetitive themes; including religion and moral values, the role of women, motherhood and childcare, and better schools. I employ Jamieson’s double binds, Hariman’s political styles, and Burkean pentadic ratios to explore Dole’s discourse. Beyond her own words, I also examine how both the elite press and political blogs characterized her as a political figure. Finally, I discuss the implications of Dole’s political style. I conclude that over the course of her thirty-year public life, Dole managed to construct a political image that balances a Ciceronian republican style and her own demure, feminine style in an effort to deal with the tensions and challenges female politicians face. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Dole</b> {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} in the US presidential election of 2000, but {{pulled out of the}} race in October 1999 before any of the primaries, largely due to inadequate fundraising even though a Gallup poll had her in second place in the presidential race at 11% behind George W. Bush at 60% as late as October 1999. Dole placed third—behind George W. Bush and Steve Forbes—in a large field in the Iowa Straw Poll (the first, non-binding, test of electability for the Republican Party nomination). The Iowa Straw Poll differed from the national polls where she was second only to Bush; Senator John McCain was in third place.|$|E
25|$|In North Carolina, {{there had}} been rumors that Senator <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Dole</b> would retire from the Senate and run for governor, but she said in 2006 that she {{intended}} to run for re-election. There was early speculation that North Carolina Governor Mike Easley might be pressured into running against her but this {{did not come to}} pass. The Democratic nominee was state Senator Kay Hagan, who defeated Jim Neal and Dustin Lassiter in the Democratic primary. A Rasmussen poll released May 11, 2008 showed Hagan leading Dole by a statistically insignificant margin, 48% - 47%, suggesting a competitive race. Hagan's poll numbers continued to best Dole's, however, and Hagan defeated Dole by a wider than expected margin of 53% to 44%.|$|E
