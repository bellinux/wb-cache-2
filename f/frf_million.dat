5000|$|The carrier began a steep decline {{during the}} decade, {{just after the}} ″Africanisation″ of the airline, i.e. Africans holding all top positions, was completed. Since that time, overbooked flights became frequent, tickets {{reserved}} for the member states were never paid, and schedules were missed {{to such an extent}} that some flights arrived half a day later or even departed ahead of schedule without any explanation. Losses mounted to <b>FRF</b> 68 <b>million</b> and <b>FRF</b> 6,8 <b>million</b> for 1983 and 1984, respectively; by contrast, the carrier made an <b>FRF</b> 17.6 <b>million</b> ( [...] million) profit during 1985. The number of passengers carried that year was 757,000, a 9.5% increase from the previous year. Largely due to the acquisition of new aircraft or wet-leasing planes from other companies, at early 1985 the carrier had a total debt of [...] million, with approximately a fifth of this amount being unpaid contributions from the member states. Director-general Koffi Aoussou also attributed the losses to the rise in fuel prices (Air Afrique spent [...] million in fuel in 1978 and almost [...] million in 1984), to overstaffing, to the increase in competition (mainly from UTA in the European routes), and to poor performance of the member countries' economies. During 1985, Auxence Ickonga, former head of the Congolese state-owned oil company Hydrocongo, succeeded Ivorian Aoussou Koffi as president and director general of the airline with plans to reduce salaries, shrink the 5,600-strong staff by 515, and to sell a Boeing 747 for [...] million in order to make the company economically viable. By , the debt-to-equity ratio was 8:1, with obligations rising to <b>FRF</b> 1,800 <b>million.</b> At the same time, the fleet comprised three A300s, two Boeing 727s (one chartered from Air France and the other from JAT), two DC-8s and three DC-10s; the Boeing 747 cargo that Ickonga intended to sell to alleviate the financial crisis was acquired by Korean Air Lines for [...] million.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{following}} the Tour de France, Crédit Agricole became the lead {{sponsor of the}} cycling team led by Roger Legeay, previously sponsored by Gan, an insurer. The initial investment was <b>FRF</b> 30 <b>million</b> a year. Over the years, the team won many stages in major cycling races {{as well as several}} national championships. In 2008, Crédit Agricole reviewed its sports sponsorship strategy and ended its partnership after ten years.|$|R
50|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24‑hour total was 26.8 inches (680 mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, {{the capital city}} of Fort-de-France reported 13.4 in (341 mm). There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24 hours; about 1 inch (26 mm) fell in 5 minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02 inches (153 mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67 mph (108 km/h), with gusts reaching 99 mph (160 km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186 homes and left 700 people homeless. The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32 <b>million</b> francs (1970 <b>FRF,</b> $5.8 <b>million</b> 1970 USD); a total of 3.75 mi² (9.72 km²) of banana crop was destroyed, and 2.16 mi² (5.6 km²) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190 <b>million</b> francs (1970 <b>FRF,</b> $34 <b>million</b> 1970 USD).|$|R
5000|$|The carrier {{was formed}} by the {{government}} of Tunisia as Société Tunisienne de l'Air in late 1948. The initial investment was <b>FRF</b> 60 <b>million,</b> with shareholding split between the government (35%), Air France (35%) and another interests (30%). Air France transferred some of its DC-3s and routes (which included Tunis-Bone-Algiers, Tunis-Ajaccio-Nice, Tunis-Bastia-Nice, Tunis-Rome and a cargo flight between Tunis and Marseilles) to the new airline for it to start operations; these commenced on [...] The first managing director of the company was Rene Lefevre.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Air Afrique had {{accumulated}} debts for over 200 billion CFA francs. The consortium members (Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo) sought assistance from France. On 2 March 1989, Rolland Billecart —a high-ranking {{official of the}} French government— entered the company, becoming the first non-African chairman and CEO of Air Afrique with plans to keep the company afloat that included {{the reduction of the}} workforce by 2,000. The company carried 710,498 passengers in 1988 and recorded an <b>FRF</b> 288 <b>million</b> net loss for the year, whereas an <b>FRF</b> 7.3 <b>million</b> ( [...] million) net profit was posted the following year, with 754,314 passengers carried. The workforce was cut by 1,600 in June 1989. The new management lobbied to restrict foreign airlines to serve the member countries in order for Air Afrique {{to take advantage of this}} situation. Agadez was made part of the route network in the fall of 1989. For a short period of time starting in late 1989, a 302-seater Lockheed L-1011, a 137-seater Boeing 737 and a Boeing 707 Freighter were leased from American Trans Air, Aeromaritime and Naganagani, respectively, in order to supplement the fleet.|$|R
50|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} enhance facilities and benefits for people with disabilities. A turnaround of the justice system was carried out, aimed at ensuring that a defendant really is innocent until proven guilty. The linking of benefit payments {{to the cost of}} living was introduced, together with a one billion franc emergency package for the unemployed. A <b>FRF</b> 500 <b>million</b> budget established to fund partly the training benefit payable to unemployed persons (1998).Improvements in the handicapped employment service, COTOREP, were carried out, while {{measures were}} introduced to upgrade handicapped access to public transport together with all types of buildings used by members of the general public.|$|R
50|$|In {{the four}} decades that followed, the {{facility}} was left essentially untouched. When France {{won the right}} to host the European Championship with Strasbourg as a venue, La Meinau was rebuilt from the ground up at a cost of just over <b>FRF</b> 120 <b>million.</b> It became a compact, fully rectangular stadium with quarter-corners between the four main stands (North, South, West and East), not unlike Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Inaugurated on April 18, 1984, two months before the Euro, La Meinau hosted a record 44,566 for the first-round match between West Germany and Portugal match (0-0). The stadium remained state-of-the-art through the 1980s and hosted the 1988 UEFA Cup Winners Cup final that saw K.V. Mechelen defeat Ajax Amsterdam 1-0.|$|R
50|$|Le Pen {{began his}} {{professional}} career with Rennes {{where he spent}} six years. In 110 games, he scored once. Either a winger or central midfielder, he is renowned for his passing. He moved to Laval where he scored 14 goals in 50 games within two seasons. In 2001, he moved to Lorient, where in two seasons he scored 14 times in 63 games, scoring every 4.5 games. He stayed with Lorient until November 2001. Despite interest from Rangers F.C He was then transferred to Ipswich Town for <b>FRF</b> 15 <b>million</b> (GBP 1.4 million). He only played once, but got injured almost immediately resulting in only 12 minutes of play for the club, despite making a further appearance in the FA and UEFA Cups he never played again in a league game for Ipswich; {{it is assumed that}} he and his family never really settled in England.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the tragic}} events of Heysel, Hillsborough and Furiani, safety {{regulations}} were reinforced, progressively {{limiting the number}} of standing places. This change severely affected La Meinau since the stadium had large standing-only terraces all around the pitch. Capacity dropped from the initial 45,000 to 26,000, all seated. Hence, in 1996, RC Strasbourg could not rely on a large attendance when they hosted AC Milan for the 1995-96 UEFA Cup. In 1993, La Meinau was considered as a strong potential candidate to host games for World Cup 1998 by Michel Platini, who organized the tournament, especially because of its proximity to Germany and Central Europe in general. However, {{at a time when the}} local team was performing erratically, the City of Strasbourg was unwilling to assume the cost of the works necessary to host the World Cup - estimated at <b>FRF</b> 200 <b>million</b> - citing other costly projects under way, especially the tram. (Since Metz also declined an invitation to host the cup, there were no games in 1998 in the whole Northeastern France.) ...|$|R
5000|$|There was a {{shock when}} a {{videocassette}} of businessman [...] was disclosed {{after his death in}} 1999, with Le Monde publishing its full contents in September 2000. In the tape, Méry gave details of kickback schemes in the Paris region; in particular, he said that he delivered <b>FRF</b> 5 <b>million</b> in cash to Michel Roussin, chief of staff of then prime minister Jacques Chirac, [...] "in Chirac's presence". [...] "We only work on Mr. Chirac's orders," [...] Méry said in the video. It was on these grounds that investigating magistrate Éric Halphen summoned president Jacques Chirac in March 2001 as witness, declaring that there were sufficients [...] "clues" [...] to warrant a full investigation. In September 2001, the Paris Appeal Court cancelled part of the proceedings on procedural vices, and removing the affair from judge Halphen's hands. In February 2005, investigating magistrate Armand Riberolles, who succeeded Halphen, abandoned charges against Jean Tiberi (who succeeded Chirac as mayor of Paris), who as former president of the OPAC (Office Public d'Aménagement et de Construction) of Paris, was prosecuted for [...] "complicity in corruption" [...] (complicité de traffic d'influence).|$|R
50|$|The name Grès was {{a partial}} anagram of her husband's first name and alias. He was Serge Czerefkov, a Russian painter, who left her {{soon after the}} house's creation. Grès enjoyed years of {{critical}} successes but, after Grès herself sold the business in the 1980s to Yagi Tsucho, a Japanese company, they hired Lloyd Klein as the artistic director for the entire house supervising 46 licencies between Paris and Japan, at the time Klein was offered {{one of the highest}} salaries of 150.000 FRF per month and an annual fee of 12 <b>Million</b> <b>FRF</b> after the death of Madame Grès, Lloyd Klein left the house to continue his collections in New York.
