5|$|During the Bristol Blitz in the Second World War a bomb {{exploded}} {{in a nearby}} street, throwing a rail from the tramway over the houses and into the churchyard of St Mary Redcliffe, where it became embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The rail is left there as a monument.|$|E
5|$|In Operation Deliberate Force, the NATO bombing {{campaign}} over Bosnia in 1995, six Jaguars, based in Italy, conducted 63 strike missions. The last Jaguars in French service were retired in 2005, being replaced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> attack roles by the Dassault Rafale.|$|E

5|$|Rove beetles: Charoxus spinifer is a rove beetle (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) whose adults enter late-stage syconia of F. aurea and F. citrifolia. Adults eat fig wasps; larvae develop {{within the}} syconia and prey on fig wasps, then pupate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{historic}} sites {{relating to the}} American Revolution period are preserved {{as part of the}} Boston National Historical Park because of the city's prominent role. Many are found along the Freedom Trail, which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

50|$|Lake Raadi is a lake on {{the edge}} of Tartu, Estonia. It was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of <b>the</b> 18th century Raadi Manor and it is still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> which are open to <b>the</b> public. <b>The</b> <b>grounds</b> were {{designed}} by the German landscape artist Peter Joseph Lenné.|$|R
500|$|The hall {{is open to}} {{the general}} public at advertised times. A series of events is held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall during the year. [...] There is a {{licensed}} tea room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds,</b> and <b>the</b> hall is also licensed for civil weddings. Ceremonies are conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Long Hall, and receptions can be held in a marquee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> During <b>the</b> summer months plays, concerts and other entertainments take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open-air theatre close to the hall.|$|R
5000|$|Bullingdon Green was a cricket <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> Oxford, Oxfordshire. <b>The</b> first {{recorded}} match on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was <b>in</b> 1843, when Oxford University played the Marylebone Cricket Club <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> first first-class. During {{that same year}} they played Cambridge University <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> second and final first-class match. [...] <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> continued to hold cricket fixtures until at least 1879, when the last recorded match on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> saw <b>the</b> Bullingdon Club play I Zingari.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Keyblade War begins and the player battles four Foretellers before {{collapsing}} in exhaustion. The war ends with numerous Keyblades planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> forming the Keyblade Graveyard {{and with the}} player's character laying {{in the middle of}} the graveyard (presumably dying) while Chirithy, Skuld, and Ephemer approach them.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E

5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to strike down nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E

5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil {{in the place of}} water.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests may be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign}} of threats.|$|E
5|$|Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' {{isolation}} and {{dependence on the}} bounty {{of the natural world}} meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> near the Stallir House on Boreray.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the £15,000 {{cost of the}} new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, {{one of his many}} influential changes was {{to take advantage of the}} lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E
