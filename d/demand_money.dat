5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had {{made it difficult for}} the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry {{ransomware}} attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Sly {{or one of}} {{the band}} members would often miss the gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use. This had an adverse effect on their ability to <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> for live bookings; live bookings also {{declined}} as a result. At many gigs, concert-goers rioted if the band failed to appear or if Sly walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group's promoter, and later their general manager, when other representatives wouldn't work with the band because of their erratic attendance. In January 1975, the band booked itself at Radio City Music Hall. The famed music hall was only one-eighth occupied, and Sly and company had to scrape together money to return home. Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved.|$|E

Unlike for the other two Phase 1 stations, rents for buildings in the station area had not reached their maximum.

500|$|A thirty-eight-day {{strike in}} 1958 hurt The Inquirer and, after the strike ended, so many reporters had {{accepted}} buyout offers and left that the newsroom was noticeably empty. Furthermore, many current reporters had been copyclerks {{just before the}} strike and had little experience. One of the few star reporters of the 1950s and 1960s was investigative reporter Harry Karafin. During his career Harry Karafin exposed corruption and other exclusive stories for The Inquirer, but also extorted money out of individuals and organizations. Karafin would claim he had harmful information and would <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> {{in exchange for the}} information not being made public. This went on from the late 1950s into the early 1960s before Karafin was exposed in 1967 and convicted of extortion a year later.

500|$|Most of the 1215 {{charter and}} later {{versions}} sought {{to govern the}} feudal rights of the Crown over the barons. Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, {{the rights of the}} King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. Feudal relief was one way that a king could <b>demand</b> <b>money,</b> and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands. Scutage was a form of medieval taxation; all knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King, but many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead; the Crown [...] often used the cash to pay for mercenaries. The rate of scutage that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial; clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.|$|E

2500|$|As with {{previous}} {{entries in the}} series, the game uses a turn-based combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to long-range and short-range weapons, {{in addition to being}} able to summon Personas. Personas, the manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche, are summoned through the mask each character wears. Beginning with an initial Persona, the party uses elemental, physical and magical attacks: most enemies have a particular weakness. If a character strikes an enemy's weak point, they are awarded an additional turn and knock down the enemy. When all enemies are knocked down, a [...] "Hold Up" [...] session is triggered. During Hold Up, the party can launch a devastating All-Out Attack, <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> or items, or enter Negotiation. Negotiation allows the protagonist to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded if the protagonist is of the right level and has sufficient room in their roster. If a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by the enemy Shadows, and will be unable to return to the party if the resultant Negotiation fails. Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the player immediately loses.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} among scholars that, unlike in Western Europe, Polish {{collaboration with the}} Nazis was insignificant. However, the Nazi terror combined with inadequacy of food rations, as well as German greed, along with the system of corruption as the only [...] "one language the Germans understood well," [...] wrecked traditional values. Poles helping Jews faced unparalleled dangers {{not only from the}} German occupiers but also from their own ethnically diverse countrymen including Polish-German Volksdeutsche, and Polish Ukrainians, many of whom were anti-Semitic and morally disoriented by the war. There were people, the so-called szmalcownicy ("shmalts people" [...] from shmalts or szmalec, slang term for money), who blackmailed the hiding Jews and Poles helping them, or who turned the Jews to the Germans for a reward. Outside the cities there were peasants of various ethnic backgrounds looking for Jews hiding in the forests, to <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> from them. There were also Jews turning in other Jews and non-Jewish Poles for profit, or in order to alleviate hunger with the awarded prize. The vast majority of these individuals joined the criminal underworld after the German occupation and were {{responsible for the deaths of}} tens of thousands of people, both Jews and the Poles who were trying to save them. The fear of denunciation not only deterred many Jews from attempting to find shelter among Poles, but also discouraged well-intentioned Poles who feared denunciators and slanderers.|$|E
2500|$|The Yepanchins' {{visit is}} rudely {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} Burdovsky, a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Myshkin's late benefactor, Pavlishchev. The inarticulate Burdovsky is supported by a group of insolent young men. These include the consumptive seventeen-year-old Ippolit Terentyev—a friend of Kolya's—who surprises everyone with his shrill, hysterical voice; the nihilist Doctorenko, who is Lebedyev's nephew; and Keller, an ex-officer who, with the help of Lebedyev, has written an article vilifying the Prince and Pavlishchev. They <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> from Myshkin as a [...] "just" [...] reimbursement for Pavlishchev's support, but their arrogant bravado is severely dented when Gavril Ardalionovich, who has been researching the matter on Myshkin's behalf, proves conclusively that the claim is false and that Burdovsky has been deceived. The Prince tries to reconcile with the young men and offers financial support anyway. Disgusted by the young men and the Prince's conciliatory attitude, Lizaveta Prokofyevna loses all control and furiously attacks both parties. This causes Ippolit to laugh and Lizaveta Prokofyevna seizes him by the arm. Ippolit breaks into a prolonged fit of coughing, but he suddenly becomes calm, informs them all that he is near death, and politely requests that he be permitted to talk to them for a while. He awkwardly attempts to express his need for their love, eventually bringing both himself and Lizaveta Prokofyevna to the point of tears. But as the Prince and Lizaveta Prokofyevna discuss {{what to do with the}} invalid, another transformation occurs and Ippolit, after unleashing a torrent of abuse at the Prince, leaves with the other young men. The Yepanchins also leave, both Lizaveta Prokofyevna and Aglaya deeply indignant with the Prince. Only Yevgeny Pavlovich remains in good spirits, and he smiles charmingly as he says good-bye. At that moment, a magnificent carriage suddenly pulls up at the dacha, and the ringing voice of Nastassya Filippovna calls out to Yevgeny Pavlovich. In a laughing, familiar tone she tells him not to worry about all the IOUs as Rogozhin has bought them up. The carriage departs, leaving everyone, particularly Yevgeny Pavlovich and the Prince, in a state of shock. Yevgeny Pavlovich claims to know nothing about the debts, and Nastassya Filippovna's motives become a subject of anxious speculation.|$|E

60|$|A fourth mode {{of making}} credit answer the {{purposes}} of money, by which, when carried far enough, money may be very completely superseded, consists in making payments by checks. The custom of keeping the spare cash reserved for immediate use, or against contingent demands, {{in the hands of}} a banker, and making all payments, except small ones, by orders on bankers, is in this country spreading to a continually larger portion of the public. If the person making the payment and the person receiving it keep their money with the same banker, the payment takes place without any intervention of money, by the mere transfer of its amount in the banker’s books from the credit of the payer to that of the receiver. If all persons in [New York] kept their cash at the same banker’s, and made all their payments by means of checks, no money would be required or used for any transactions beginning and terminating in [New York]. This ideal limit is almost attained, in fact, so far as regards transactions between [wholesale] dealers. It is chiefly in the retail transactions between dealers and consumers, and in the payment of wages, that money or bank-notes now pass, and then only when the amounts are small. As for the merchants and larger dealers, they habitually make all payments in the course of their business by checks. They do not, however, all deal with the same banker, and, when A gives a check to B, B usually pays it not into the same but into some other bank. But the convenience of business has given birth to an arrangement which makes all the banking-houses of [a] city, for certain purposes, virtually one establishment. A banker does not send the checks which are paid into his banking-house to the banks on which they are drawn, and <b>demand</b> <b>money</b> for them. There is a building called the Clearing-House, to which every [member of the association] sends, each afternoon, all the checks on other bankers which he has received during the day, and they are there exchanged for the checks on him which have come into the hands of other bankers, the balances only being paid in money; or even these not in money, but in checks.|$|E
