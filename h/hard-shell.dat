25|$|In 1985, Snell B85 was introduced, {{the first}} widely adopted {{standard}} for bicycle helmets; this has subsequently been refined into B90 and B95 (see Standards below). At this time helmets were almost all either <b>hard-shell</b> or no-shell (perhaps with a vacuum-formed plastic cover). Ventilation was still minimal due mainly to technical {{limitations of the}} foams and shells in use.|$|E

All helmets used in competition are required to be <b>hard-shell</b> helmets.|$|E

2500|$|Caught {{lobsters}} are graded as new-shell, <b>hard-shell,</b> or old-shell, {{and because}} lobsters which have recently shed their shells {{are the most}} delicate, an inverse relationship exists between the price of American lobster and its flavour. New-shell lobsters have paper-thin shells and a worse meat-to-shell ratio, but the meat is very sweet. However, the lobsters are so delicate, even transport to Boston almost kills them, making the market for new-shell lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded. <b>Hard-shell</b> lobsters with firm shells, but with less sweet meat, can survive shipping to Boston, New York, and even Los Angeles, so they command a higher price than new-shell lobsters. Meanwhile, old-shell lobsters, which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavour, can be air-shipped {{anywhere in the world}} and arrive alive, making them the most expensive. One seafood guide notes that an $8 lobster dinner at a restaurant overlooking fishing piers in Maine is consistently delicious, while [...] "the eighty-dollar lobster in a three-star Paris restaurant is apt to be as much about presentation as flavor".|$|E

Its ventral (lower) surface has large, white spots {{on a dark}} background, and its dorsal (upper) surface has black spots on yellow. [...] This {{is a form of}} countershading: from below, the white spots look like the lighted surface of the water above; and from above, the fish blends more with the coral reef below. The brightly painted yellow mouth may deter potential predators.|$|E

2500|$|While his ninja-outfit {{template}} {{from the}} first generation of games has remained relatively unchanged over time, the software technology of the post-Mortal Kombat 4 three-dimensional releases have allowed more detailed costuming for the characters, and Scorpion's costumes were duly enhanced with objects such as two katanas strapped to his back and his spear attached to a rope tied to his belt in Deadly Alliance, and a set of ornate shoulder epaulets in Deception, in which his alternate costume was a throwback to the two-dimensional MK titles. Scorpion's MK2011 costume is his most detailed to date and inspired by his namesake, such as the character's abdomen-shaped shoulder pads, the two stinger-handled swords crisscrossed on his back, and the exoskeletal pattern on his <b>hard-shell</b> face mask. Scorpion was included with Sub-Zero, Reptile and Ermac in a bundle of classic costumes {{from the first}} Mortal Kombat that was released as downloadable content for the 2011 reboot. For Injustice: Gods Among Us, he received a new costume designed by comic artist Jim Lee. In the original Mortal Kombats fighter-selection screen, Scorpion had regular human eyes, as his identity as a resurrected specter {{was meant to be a}} mystery, but he was given solid yellow or white eyes for every release thereafter starting with MKII, while actors portraying Scorpion in live-action media such as the feature films and the [...] web series were outfitted with opaque contact lenses in order to achieve this effect.|$|E

Fine ladies in slippers, and moccasined squaws; Northern speculators and Eastern philosophers; English, Irish, German, Scotch, Danes; Santa FÃ© traders in striped blankets, and Broadway bucks in cravats of cloth of gold; fine-looking Kentucky boatmen, and Japanese-looking Mississippi cotton-planters; Quakers in full drab, and United States soldiers in full regimentals; slaves, black, mulatto, quadroon; modish young Spanish Creoles, and old-fashioned French Jews; Mormons and Papists Dives and Lazarus; jesters and mourners, teetotalers and convivialists, deacons and blacklegs; <b>hard-shell</b> Baptists and clay-eaters; grinning negroes, and Sioux chiefs solemn as high-priests.

6000|$|Of {{the four}} it was Carl {{who seemed to}} have the {{greatest}} interest in religions. He blurted out such monologues as, [...] "I wonder if it isn't pure egotism that makes a person believe that the religion he is born to is the best? My country, my religion, my wife, my business--we think that whatever is ours is necessarily sacred, or, in other words, that we are gods--and then we call it faith and patriotism! The Hindu or the Christian is equally ready to prove to you--and mind you, he may be a wise old man with a beard--that his national religion is obviously the only one. Find out what you yourself really do think, and if you turn out a Sun-worshiper or a <b>Hard-shell</b> Baptist, why, good luck. If you don't think for yourself, then you're admitting that your theory of happiness is the old dog asleep in the sun. And maybe he is happier than the student.

"Writing as a <b>hard-shell</b> Darwinian evolutionist, a {{lover of}} the scalpel and microscope, and of patient, {{empirical}} observation, as one who dislikes all forms of supernaturalism, and who does not shrink from the implications even of the phrase that thought is a secretion of the brain as bile is a secretion of the liver, I assert as a biological fact that the moral law is as real and as external to man as the starry vault. It has no secure seat in any single man or in any single nation. It {{is the work of}} the blood and tears of long generations of men. It is not in man, inborn or innate, but is enshrined in his traditions, in his customs, in his literature and his religion. Its creation and sustenance are the crowning glory of man, and his consciousness of it puts him in a high place above the animal world. Men live and die; nations rise and fall, but the struggle of individual lives and of individual nations must be measured not by their immediate needs, but as they tend to the debasement or perfection of man's great achievement." ...|$|E

It was all the same to me, you may suppose; but I said I thought Adams was the fellow to consult. He was jawing away about watered copra and a sight of foolery. 'Look here,' I said, 'you're pretty sick. Would you like to see Galoshes?' He sat right up on his elbow. 'Get the priest,' says he, 'get the priest; don't let me die here like a dog!' He spoke kind of fierce and eager, but sensible enough. There was nothing to say against that, so we sent and asked Galuchet if he would come. You bet he would. He jumped in his dirty linen at the thought of it. But we had reckoned without Papa. He's a <b>hard-shell</b> Baptist, is Papa; no Papists need apply. And he took and locked the door. Buncombe told him he was bigoted, and I thought he would have had a fit. 'Bigoted!' he says. 'Me bigoted? Have I lived to hear it from a jackanapes like you?' And he made for Buncombe, and I had to hold them apart; and there was Adams in the middle, gone luny again, and carrying on about copra like a born fool. It was good as the play, and I was about knocked out of time with laughing, {{when all of a sudden}} Adams sat up, clapped his hands to his chest, and went into horrors. He died hard, did John Adams," [...] says Case, with a kind of a sudden sternness.|$|E
