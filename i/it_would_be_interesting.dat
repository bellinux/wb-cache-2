The captain decides {{that they should be}} exiled to Ceti AlphaV, a harsh world that Kirk {{believes}} would be a perfect place for Khan to start his kingdom. Khan claims he is up to the challenge of taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to see what Khan makes of Ceti AlphaV in 100years.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{also thought}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> {{for there to}} be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun againâ€”Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to see what unfolded between them.|$|E

5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E

Attention focuses on her part in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to know her role in this, as well as in Tiberius' divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus' insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar's wishes. The first divorce left Tiberius a fosterchild at the house of Octavian; the second left Tiberius with a lasting emotional scar, since he had been forced to abandon the woman he loved for dynastic considerations.|$|E

25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> and fun to work together.|$|E

According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to go out with someone named Hadassah. (Hadassah {{is the name of the}} Women's Zionist Organization of America). Since March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman has worked for Hill & Knowlton, a {{lobbying}} firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She has held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.|$|E
25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> {{to know if the}} inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order {{to increase the number of}} problems that can be solved.|$|E

25|$|Different cover artwork {{was created}} by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versionsthe PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was {{originally}} told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting.</b> The two characters were originally {{going to be in}} identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms. This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risque.|$|E

500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-upâ€“ one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E

Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode. Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Sakanaction {{was first}} formed in August 2005 in Sapporo, Hokkaido. It was {{originally}} a two-member unit, consisting of vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi and guitarist Motoharu Iwadera. Yamaguchi first worked together with Iwadera {{in the band}} Dutchman, that formed at their high school in 1998 and performed British rock-inspired music. In 2004, the band broke up, and Yamaguchi took the name for his solo project, where he created techno and club music.

It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Whitney.

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton in 1971, Berg decided {{to expand the}} thesis into a {{full-length}} biography, thinking it would take around nine months. He also formulated a career plan at this time, and later recalled: [...] "I did tell myself early on: I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting,</b> perhaps, to spend a career writing a half-dozen biographies of twentieth-century American cultural figuresâ€”each one, as I often use as my metaphor, a different wedge of the great apple pie." [...] The Perkins biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, took longer than Berg anticipated and was eventually published in 1978, winning a National Book Award in Biography. In 2016, The New Yorker credited Berg with [...] "almost single-handedly rescu Maxwell Perkins from the anonymity he desired." ...|$|E
500|$|Incorporating Nixon {{into the}} plot was accidental; Moffat {{wanted to set}} the story during the moon landing and looked up the United States {{president}} during the time.

However, he thought it [...] "didn't feel right for a story partly about real events" [...] and realized it could be fun to use Nixon. He believed there was something [...] "comically awkward" [...] about him, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> for the Doctor to have to work with someone he did not like.

500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the standard of the Roman legion, a symbol that represents the legion's unity. While the storyline detailing its theft was based on fiction, Heller believed that it showed how Caesar could turn [...] "misfortune into opportunity. He was always one step ahead of his enemies." [...] Certain characters were changed from their traditional images; for instance, while Brutus has been portrayed as the noblest Roman, Heller and historical consultant Jonathan Stamp thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to have him forced into his later role through his ancestry. Alluding to the fact that Brutus' great great great grandfather [...] "drove the last king out of Rome", Stamp said that [...] "his family history was pushing him in one direction, his emotions in another." ...|$|E
