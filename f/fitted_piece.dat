5000|$|A {{sanding block}} is a block {{used to hold}} sandpaper. In its {{simplest}} form, it is a block of wood or cork with one smooth flat side. The user wraps the sandpaper around the block, and holds it in place (by inserting a <b>fitted</b> <b>piece</b> of cardboard under the sandpaper, one can soften {{the impact on the}} wood and protect against tears or uneven wear on the sandpaper). Sanding blocks are helpful because they prevent the [...] "waves" [...] created by plain sandpaper.|$|E

40|$|The {{packing of}} {{rectangles}} with both dimensions i. i. d. ∼U(0, 1) onto a semi-infinite fixed-width strip is considered. The expected efficiency, {{expressed in terms}} of unused area on the strip is calculated for three simple procedures, all of which are level-algorithms: Next Fit, Rotatable Next <b>Fit</b> (where <b>pieces</b> are possibly orientated before packing, so that their width always exceeds their height), and Next <b>Fit</b> Decreasing (<b>pieces</b> are presorted by their height). It becomes evident that the single most important determinant of this efficiency is the variance of level heights, and the procedures can be ranked by their success in keeping this variance down. It is indirectly demonstrated that worstcase behavior of simple packing algorithms is a poor predictor of their expected performance. Results were obtained via analysis, computer (symbolic) integration, and simulation...|$|R

Aside {{from the different}} name, the North American market 710 received large separate bumpers rather than the curved, <b>fitted</b> <b>pieces</b> used in other markets to comply with United States bumper legislation in 1973. Early export market cars were fitted with tiny chrome cover plates to hide the holes left {{on top of the}} front fenders by the Japanese market rear view mirrors. The most powerful version offered in Japan was the fuel injected 1600 SSS-E with [...] JIS at 6200 rpm. In export markets the twin-carb 160J SSS claimed [...] DIN, five more than the regular 160J. In Japan, the 1800 cc engine arrived in October 1975 and was only available running on LPG, for taxi use.|$|R

50|$|The song 'Mammoth' {{is one of}} {{the very}} few pop singles to feature a barrel organ (or street organ). The organ, The Flamingo, was too big to get through the studio entrance.
