5|$|Ser Alliser Thorne convenes {{the other}} black {{brothers}} and takes responsibility for Jon's murder. Several black brothers accuse Thorne {{and the other}} officers of treason, but Thorne wins them over by citing Jon's actions and stating that Jon would have destroyed the Night's Watch by letting in the Wildlings. Alliser and the other mutineers then surround the store-room and promise Davos and Jon's friends amnesty if they surrender, but threaten to attack if they don't open the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E
5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted <b>door</b> <b>by</b> her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by the image of her step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E

The central portal has the Renaissance bronze <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Antonio Averulino (called Filarete) (1455), {{enlarged}} {{to fit the}} new space. The southern door, the Door of the Dead, was designed by 20th-century sculptor Giacomo Manzù and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.|$|E
25|$|The service {{continued}} with prayers and exhortations by the dean and archbishop. A newly composed choral anthem was sung by the choir. After {{the signing of}} the registers, William and Kate walked down the aisle, pausing briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen. They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families, being joined at the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> the two youngest flower girls.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{sliding doors}} {{are open and}} closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a <b>door</b> <b>by</b> turning a doorknob or pressing up against a bar on the door itself. Automatic sliding doors are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic sliding door.|$|E

They are met at the front <b>door</b> <b>by</b> their own two children, who have found their parents' double-barreled shotgun and want to play. Before either mother or father can react, the children shoot their parents to death. Thinking that mom and dad are playing dead, the young boy and girl rush off outside to find another game.|$|E
25|$|Freddy attacks Nancy once again. Realizing he {{is powered}} by his victim's fear, she calmly turns her back on him, {{reducing}} him to nothingness. She steps outside into a bright morning where all of her friends and mother are still alive. She gets into Glen's car {{to go to school}} when the top comes down and suddenly locks them in. As the car is driven uncontrollably down the street, Marge is grabbed through the window of their front <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Freddy's gloved hand and is dragged through it to her apparent death.|$|E
25|$|Adair {{also sought}} {{to work closely with}} Belfast-based dissidents such as Frankie Curry and Jackie Mahood, {{provoking}} further anger from the UVF. Another loyalist feud erupted, and ended with several men dead and scores evicted from their homes. The Rathcoole home of long-standing UDA member Sammy Duddy was raked by gunfire; although Duddy was not injured in the shooting attack, his pet chihuahua Bambi was fatally wounded by shots fired through the front <b>door</b> <b>by</b> masked gunmen from Adair's C Company. Adair later admitted in an interview he gave for journalist Suzanne Breen that Duddy never got over the loss of Bambi.|$|E

Instead, he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone was amazed that he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to Fayyum and confirmed the brethren there in the Christian faith before returning to his fort.|$|E
25|$|The group {{played a}} further two shows in Las Vegas {{at the end}} of 2001. Former guitarist Slash claimed that he tried to attend a show and was turned away at the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> security. Due to his frustrations with touring, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band in 2002 and was {{replaced}} by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). Fortus is good friends with and had previously collaborated with bassist Tommy Stinson, who recommended him for the position. Producer Roy Thomas Baker was fired in February 2002. Drudge Report reported in June 2002 that Chinese Democracy was scheduled for a September 2, 2002 release.|$|E
25|$|Although {{smaller than}} the other fells {{surrounding}} Wasdale Head — Scafell Pike, Scafell, Great Gable, Kirk Fell and Pillar — the ascent of Yewbarrow by the two traditional routes involves some scrambling. There are two primary ascents to Yewbarrow from Wasdale Head, via Overbeck Bridge and the Great Door (a cleft in the rocks providing thrilling views of Wast Water) or via Dore Head and Stirrup Crag. It is possible to circumvent almost all the scrambling on the route via Great <b>Door</b> <b>by</b> taking a path {{to the left of}} the major gully, and a cairned track without any scrambling runs up the west side from below Stirrup Crag to the minor col between the two tops of Yewbarrow.|$|E

Phillips was followed through the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> Everton defender Brendan Galloway to joined on a season-long loan. On 29 August 2016, the club agreed a deal with Tottenham to sign Belgian international Nacer Chadli for a club-record transfer fee of £13million. On transfer deadline day, Chadli was joined by the pacey Watford fullback Allan Nyom, who joined for an undisclosed fee believed to be £3million. The last player to join was the unattached Hal Robson-Kanu, who had an impressive Euro 2016 campaign with the Wales national team.|$|E
25|$|The Bombay's main {{service was}} in the Middle East, {{particularly}} with 216 Squadron, which operated most of the Bombays built at some stage. When the war with Italy began in June 1940, {{in the absence of}} more modern aircraft, 216 Squadron's Bombays were used as night bombers as well as in their principal role as transport aircraft. The design bombload of 250 lb bombs under the fuselage was supplemented by improvised bombs thrown out of the cargo <b>door</b> <b>by</b> hand. The aircraft flew bombing sorties against targets in the Western Desert, including Benghazi and Tobruk, and against Italian Somaliland, until the buildup of Vickers Wellington bombers in Egypt allowed the Bombays to concentrate on transport operations.|$|E
25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E

25|$|Hangars {{with open}} {{superstructures}} often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation {{especially in the}} evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips {{to the side of}} the <b>door)</b> <b>by</b> the personnel in the hangar concern (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010).|$|E
25|$|Banks demanded more {{protection}} and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes {{with a key}} lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned to blast off the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways {{to get past the}} new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.|$|E
25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the <b>door</b> <b>by</b> lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
