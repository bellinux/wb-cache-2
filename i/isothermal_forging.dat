Therefore, estimating <b>isothermal</b> <b>forging</b> die life using traditional method will engender great errors. In this paper, an average strain of fatigue process zone in danger region is introduced to estimate service lifetime of <b>isothermal</b> <b>forging</b> die. An upper die of a Ti- 4 Al- 6 V disc is analyzed to investigate the service life of die.

In {{order to avoid}} waste material by cutting processes and to improve mechanical properties, forming processes offer many advantages but harbor also challenges. To face these challenges, especially techniques like <b>isothermal</b> <b>forging</b> are promising methods. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>forging</b> is an appropriate process for achieving a microstructure with excellent properties for high performance applications in aviation technology and turbine construction. One of the main challenges in this special process is the determination of a tool material with a high temperature resistance {{as well as a}} high resistance against the work load of forging processes. Given their high hardness, temperature resistance and wear resistance, technical ceramics feature properties classifying them as generally suitable for this application. This article deals with the complete design of an <b>isothermal</b> <b>forging</b> process with ceramic tool material for titanium forming. The material characterization of the forming material by flow curve determination is performed to receive data for FE analyses. Afterwards, a ceramic tool system for <b>isothermal</b> <b>forging</b> is designed and manufactured. The tests show that especially the brittleness of technical ceramics restricts their application as tool material for isothermal titanium forming.

In this study, the design and the experimentation process is shown, where this involves the design stage by finite element simulations, the experimental tests and the use of metallographic techniques for the required properties to be analysed. Itis observed thatthere is an improvementin the mechanical properties when the starting material is ECAP-processed before carrying out the <b>isothermal</b> <b>forging.</b> This improvement consists in an increase of 20 % in the hardness of the final connecting rod which also possesses a microstructure grain size of 500 nm.
