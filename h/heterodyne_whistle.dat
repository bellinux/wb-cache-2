5000|$|A {{second problem}} was that the {{multiple}} radio frequency stages, all tuned to the same frequency, were prone to oscillate, and the parasitic oscillations mixed with the radio station's carrier in the detector, producing audible <b>heterodynes</b> (beat notes), <b>whistles</b> and moans, in the speaker. [...] This was solved by the invention of the Neutrodyne circuit (below) and the development of the tetrode later around 1930, and better shielding between stages.|$|R
