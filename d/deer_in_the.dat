25|$|Hunting is {{controlled}} for black bear, wild turkeys, deer, and moose. There are 5,500 bears in the state. The {{goal is to}} keep the numbers between 4,500 and 6,000. In 2010 there were about 141,000 <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, which is in range of government goals. However, these are distributed unevenly and when in excess of 10–15 per square mile, negatively impact timber growth.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{management development}} has been the stringent control of <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Murchison Mountains and other takahē areas of Fiordland National Park. Following the introduction of deer hunting by helicopter, deer numbers have decreased dramatically and alpine vegetation is now recovering from years of heavy browsing. This improvement in its habitat has helped to increase takahē breeding success and survival. Current research aims to measure the impact of attacks by stoats and thus decide whether stoats are a significant problem requiring management.|$|E

25|$|The {{landscape}} {{surrounding the}} city included rich agricultural fields and hill lands for pasture {{as well as}} woods. Smaller woods are still found outside the city, but in ancient times, they were far more widespread. This meant the inhabitants had an excellent supply of timber when building their houses and other structures. The fields provided the people with a subsistence crop of wheat, barley and lentils. Flax was also harvested, but their primary source for clothing was sheep wool. They also hunted <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest, but this was probably only a luxury reserved for the nobility. Domestic animals provided meat.|$|E
25|$|Several predators {{dwell in}} the {{labyrinth}} of channels, branches and roots that poke up into the air. This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (axis axis), Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and even rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is estimated {{that there are now}} 180 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30–100 per year.|$|E

She is a small woman with a strong voice. Her bereavement makes her powerful”. Author of Beijing Coma, Ma Jian also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 New York Times article. He describes how she will once again defy authorities and lay a memorial off Chang'an Avenue. He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget.|$|E

25|$|Early {{historical}} records are replete with instances of noblemen breaking into each other's parks and killing deer therein, {{often as a}} result of a local territorial dispute or vendetta or merely from high spirits. The penalties inflicted by royal justice were severe in such instances. For example, in 1523 Sir William St Loe (d. 1556) of Sutton Court, Chew Magna, Somerset, together with 16 others, armed with bows and arrows, crossbows and swords, broke into Banwell Park in Somerset, attached to Banwell Abbey, a residence belonging to Bishop of Bath and Wells William Barlow, and killed 4 bucks and other <b>deer.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following August he made a similar raid and killed more than 20 deer, the heads of which he stuck on the boundary palings. He was ordered to appear before a magistrate, but the record of his punishment if any has not survived. However, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries a short while later, in 1552 Sir William obtained for himself from the crown the office of Keeper of Banwell Park.|$|E
25|$|Fascioloides magna is {{essentially}} of North American origin but the parasite was introduced into Europe with imported game animals {{at the second}} half of the 19th century. In spite of being native to North America the fluke was first described in Italy. In 1875, Bassi observed massive deaths of red <b>deer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Royal Park (now La Mandria Regional Park) near Torino, Italy. The signs were similar to well known fasciolosis in sheep. He named it Distomum magnum. The author believed that the parasite was introduced into the park in wapiti imported from USA in 1865. Most workers did not accept Bassi’s species because of his poor description. From 1882 to 1892, the fluke was recorded from different areas of the United States and described separately by many authors. Later, Stiles (1894) pointed out that the American findings are identical with species described previously by Bassi. Stiles made a complete morphological description of the adult fluke and named it Fasciola magna (Bassi 1875) Stiles 1894. In 1917, Ward showed that owing to the lack of the distinct anterior cone and the fact that vitellaria are confined to the region ventral to the intestinal branches, he established a new genus Fascioloides and rename it to Fascioloides magna (Bassi 1875) Ward 1917. In 1895, Stiles suggested that the life cycle of the fluke is very similar to Fasciola hepatica, i.e. it includes an aquatic snail as an intermediate host. He gave a comparative description of the egg and miracidium of the fluke. However, first reported intermediate hosts of F. magna were not published until 1930’s. The complete life cycle of F. magna, including a description of all the larval stages, was described by Swales (1935) in Canada.|$|E
