There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'.

500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. Take {{a close look at}} the world, <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> <b>doing</b> so and in the end it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> <b>doing</b> it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E

50|$|The old {{farm worker}} Pipe {{is old enough}} to retire. Even so he cannot imagine a life without work. So he <b>keeps</b> <b>on</b> <b>doing</b> his job and wonders what to do with his {{additional}} financial means. Soon a small moped comes to mind. Thus motorised he starts to explore the world around his village. One day he gets overly confident and drives under the influence of alcohol. This costs him his driver's license. But before this incident he has become the owner of a camera. Now he turns into a diligent photographer. Craving for new picture angles he even books a helicopter flight. With each little adventure he cares less for his old job until he embraces his retirement.|$|R

Writing of a [...] "glittering Notting Hill Gate" [...] event to introduce the project, Lynn Barber said of Smith: [...] "It was a startlingly unsuitable subject for such a glossy audience, but he held them spellbound.

The Indians had a wigwam of skins and the whites two canvas coverings.

A steaming hot meal was also served, which did much to make everybody feel comfortable.|$|R
