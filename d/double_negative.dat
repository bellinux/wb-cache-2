5|$|The film {{required}} over 1,400 {{visual effects}} shots, and the London-based company <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> created more than 950 of them. Working {{for six months}} on previsualisation starting in September 2005, <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> was largely responsible for sequences in the Room of Requirement, the Forbidden Forest, the Hall of Prophecies, and the Death Chamber.|$|E
5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E

40|$|Like for {{instance}} English, Dutch is a so-called double negation (DN) language. This {{means that if}} in Dutch you use two negatives in a single clause, they will negate each other's meaning and yield a positive interpretation. Another way to interpret <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> is to have them together express a single negation with no cancellation; this is called negative concord (NC) {{and it is the}} expected meaning in, {{for instance}}, the NC languages Italian, Spanish, and Romanian. While Dutch is a DN language, which means we expect <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> in Dutch to convey a DN meaning, it is still possible to convey an NC meaning in Dutch for <b>double</b> <b>negatives.</b> For this thesis, I performed a corpus study which confirmed a substantial occurrence of NC meanings for <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> in Dutch. This lead to the main question of this thesis: to what extent do we use intonation to disambiguate between DN readings and NC readings for <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> in Dutch? In order to answer this question I first performed a production experiment to explore the intonation patterns that are spontaneously produced when confronted with <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> in either a DN context or an NC context. Afterwards I used the intonation patterns found in the production experiment to perform a perception experiment. This experiment aimed at finding out whether participants would indeed judge <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> uttered with certain intonation patterns to convey either a DN meaning or an NC meaning...|$|R

Working closely with the film's VFXSupervisor, TimBurke, the team was led by VFXSupervisor, David Vickery and VFXProducer Charlotte Loughlane. The main team also included 3DSupervisor, Rick Leary and 2DSupervisor, SeanStranks.|$|E
5|$|Filming, {{originally}} {{scheduled to}} begin in Los Angeles in July2008, began in Kamloops, Savona, Cache Creek and Ashcroft, British Columbia. With a Screen Actors Guild strike looming, the film's producers made a contingency plan to salvage it.

5|$|Double Negative's {{work for}} Part 1 {{included}} the corroding Warner Brothers logo and extensive environment {{extensions of the}} Burrows and its surrounds. Additional environment work was completed on Xenophilius Lovegood's home, extending it in 3D and culminating in the Death Eaters' attack. <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> also advanced the Death Eaters' smoke effects, {{with the introduction of}} the 'flayed man' stage in between their smokey, fluid, flying state and their live-action presence upon landing. Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts the wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic.|$|E
5|$|Five {{companies}} did {{the visual}} effects – Industrial Light & Magic, <b>Double</b> <b>Negative,</b> Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless – {{under the supervision}} of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were {{completed}} by seven special effects studios, including <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> and Luma Pictures.

The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.|$|E
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors.

Today, this usage {{is limited to}} Surmiran as in ia na sa betg 'I do not know' (it has also been included in panregional Rumantsch Grischun). While the first particle was lost in Sursilvan, where negation is now formed only with buc as in jeu sai buc, the Ladin varieties lost the second particle brich(a), apparently {{under the influence of}} Italian, as in Putér eau nu se.|$|E
5000|$|Stylistically, in English, <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> can {{sometimes}} be used for understated affirmation (e.g. [...] "I'm not feeling bad" [...] vs. [...] "I'm feeling good"). The rhetorical term for this is litotes.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>negative</b> <b>double</b> was {{initially}} employed to {{distinguish it from}} the penalty, or business, or positive double, and signified a double over an opponent's opening bid whose meaning was a request for partner to bid his best suit.

25|$|Thymocytes are {{classified}} {{into a number}} of distinct maturational stages based on the expression of cell surface markers. The earliest thymocyte stage is the <b>double</b> <b>negative</b> stage (negative for both CD4 and CD8), which more recently has been better described as Lineage-negative, and which can be divided into four substages. The next major stage is the double positive stage (positive for both CD4 and CD8). The final stage in maturation is the single positive stage (positive for either CD4 or CD8).|$|E
25|$|Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan {{wrote the}} screenplay, {{which has its}} origins in a script Jonathan {{developed}} in 2007. Nolan produced the film with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book (The Science of Interstellar). Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on 35 mm in anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography commenced in late 2013 in Alberta, Iceland and Los Angeles. The film utilized extensive practical and miniature effects, while the company <b>Double</b> <b>Negative</b> created additional digital effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{creating}} the wormhole and a supermassive rotating black hole (which possesses an ergosphere, {{as opposed to}} a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin and a team of 30 people at <b>Double</b> <b>Negative.</b> Thorne would provide pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totalling to 800 terabytes of data for the movie. The resulting visual effect provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, which led to the publication of three scientific papers.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the meaning}} [...] "I {{completely}} agree", Lowth {{would have been}} referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> abolished. Because of this ambiguity, <b>double</b> <b>negatives</b> are frequently employed when making back-handed compliments. The phrase [...] "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." [...] will seldom mean [...] "Mr. Jones was very competent" [...] since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.|$|R
