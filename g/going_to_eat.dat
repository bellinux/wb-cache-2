Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie {{had anything to do with}} his being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them.

2500|$|During {{the last}} stand of Japanese forces in 1944–45, [...] "comfort women" [...] were often forced {{to commit suicide}} or were killed. At the Truk naval base, 70 [...] "comfort women" [...] were killed prior to the {{expected}} American assault as the Navy mistook the American air raid that destroyed Truk as the prelude to an American landing while during the Battle of Saipan [...] "comfort women" [...] were among those who committed suicide by jumping off the cliffs of Saipan. The Japanese government had told the Japanese colonists on Saipan that the American [...] "white devils" [...] were cannibals, and so the Japanese population preferred suicide to falling {{into the hands of}} the American [...] "white devils". In Burma, there were cases of Korean [...] "comfort women" [...] committing suicide by swallowing cyanide pills or being killed by having a hand grenade tossed into their dug-outs. During the Battle of Manila, when Japanese sailors ran amok and simply killed everyone, there were cases of [...] "comfort women" [...] being killed, through does not seem to have any systematic policy of killing [...] "comfort women". Japanese propaganda had it that the Anglo-American [...] "white devils" [...] were cannibals whose favorite food were Asians, and it is possible that many of the Asian [...] "comfort women" [...] may have actually believed this, and so preferred suicide to the supposed horrors of being eaten alive by the [...] "white devils". British soldiers fighting in Burma often reported that the Korean [...] "comfort women" [...] whom they captured were astonished to learn that the British were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them. Ironically, given this claim, there were cases of starving Japanese troops cut off on remote Pacific islands or trapped in the jungles of Burma turning towards cannibalism, and there were at least several cases where [...] "comfort women" [...] in Burma and on Pacific islands were killed to provide protein for the Japanese Army.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} when in [...] "Moses {{diligently}} inquired [...] for the goat of the sin-offering," [...] the language indicates that Moses made two inquiries: (1) If the priests had slaughtered the goat of the sin-offering, why {{had they not}} eaten it? And (2) If the priests were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it, why did they slaughter it? And immediately thereafter, [...] reports that Moses [...] "was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar," [...] and Midrash taught that through becoming angry, he forgot the law. Rav Huna taught that {{this was one of}} three instances where Moses lost his temper and as a consequence forgot a law. (The other two instances were with regard to the Sabbath in [...] and with regard to the purification of unclean metal utensils [...] ) In this case (involving Nadab and Abihu), because of his anger, Moses forgot the law that those in the first stage of mourning (onen), prior to the burial of their dead, are prohibited from eating the meat of sacrifices. Aaron asked Moses whether he should eat consecrated food on the day that his sons died. Aaron argued that since the tithe (which is of lesser sanctity) is forbidden to be eaten by a bereaved person prior to the burial of his dead, how much more certainly must the meat of the sin-offering (which is more sacred) be prohibited to a bereaved person prior to the burial of his dead. Immediately after Moses heard Aaron's argument, he issued a proclamation to the Israelites, saying that he had made an error in regard to the law and Aaron his brother came and taught him. Eleazar and Ithamar had known the law, but kept their silence out of deference to Moses, and as a reward, God addressed them directly along with Moses and Aaron in [...] When [...] reports that [...] "the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them," [...] Rabbi Hiyya taught that the words [...] "to them" [...] referred to Eleazar and Ithamar.|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to extend an earlier {{evaluation}} of the economic effects of ordinances requiring smoke-free restaurants and bars. METHODS: Sales tax data for 15 cities with smoke-free restaurant ordinances, 5 cities and 2 counties with smoke-free bar ordinances, and matched comparison locations were analyzed by multiple regression, including time and a dummy variable for the ordinance. RESULTS: Ordinances had no significant effect on the fraction of total retail sales that went <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> and drinking places or on the ratio between sales in communities with ordinances and sales in comparison communities. Ordinances requiring smoke-free bars had no significant effect on the fraction of revenues <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> and drinking places that serve all types of liquor.
