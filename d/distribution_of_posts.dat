40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades a large and {{important}} literature has emerged that uses game theoretic models of bargaining to study legislative coalitions. To test key predictions of these models, we examine the composition of coalition governments from 1946 and 2001. These predictions are almost always expressed in terms of parties ’ minimal integer voting weights. We calculate such weights for all parliamentary parties. In addition, we develop a statistical model that nests the predictions of many of these models of the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts.</b> We find that for parties that join (but did not form) the government, there is a linear relationship between their share of the voting weight in parliament and their share of cabinet posts. The party that forms the government (the formateur) receives a substantial “bonus” relative to its voting weight. The latter finding is more consistent with proposal-based bargaining models of coalition formation, and suggests that parties gain disproportionat...|$|E

She suggests that the parliamentary system of moderate pluralism after the elections, as well as the pre-electoral coalition agreements, contributed to the building of coalition governments, but that this process was undermined by a lack of a developed coalition political culture among the creators of the coalition as well as among the public in general. The coalition governments operated {{on the basis of a}} written coalition agreement that identified the mechanisms for coalition management among the coalition partners and implicitly introduced voting discipline in the parliament and the patterns of the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> in ministries, parliamentary bodies and public companies. Its main drawback were sketchy public policies which means that these were policy blind coalitions. The first coalition government (2000 - 2002) was terminated due to the feuding among the key coalition partners, and the second coalition government (2002 - 2003) ended due to the regular parliamentary elections. Though the government of 2000 - 2002 was the first coalition government in Croatia’s history and an oversized coalition government to boot, it nevertheless lasted longer than the average similar governments in other European countries...|$|E

40|$|China's rapid {{urbanization}} {{has led to}} {{many big}} metropolises absorbing their fringe rural lands to expand their urban boundaries. Beijing is such a metropolis and in its urban peripheral, {{an increasing number of}} communities have emerged that are comprised of monotonous housing projects. However, after the basic residential living requirements are satisfied, many other problems (including lack of amenities, distance between home and workplace which is particularly concerned with long commute time, traffic congestion, and etc.) exist. New remedy plans are undertaken to mitigate such problems. Huilongguan is a typical, representative case of amenity scarcity and improvement dynamic. The initial aim of this thesis is to investigate whether planning intervention can be evaluated from a crowdsourcing perspective. Using Huilongguan as a case study, research data are obtained from the Huilongguan Community Forum and Dazhongdianping website. The addition of amenities, such as transportation, shopping malls and work zones, is examined to discover how their restructuring affects the daily lives of residents. Posts on the Huilongguan Community Forum are extracted and categorized according to a specific scheme. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> is researched to determine the amenities that have drawn the most attention of residents of this community, as well as the reason. Based on an analysis of sequential content, the attitudes and opinions of residents with regard to amenities are collected and compared to show which amenities are the most satisfactory and those that are problematic. Finally, assessments are made to evaluate amenities from the perspective of users. Using community forum and public reviews is one approach among numerous others to evaluate planning intervention. In general, traditional evaluations investigate the outcome of planning at a certain time. However, since urbanization is a dynamic process, obtaining prolonged and real-time feedback from different interested parties has become a challenge of traditional evaluations. This thesis is an attempt at using crowdsourced data to evaluate planning intervention. Moreover, this tool provides a more transparent and less time-consuming way to analyze first-hand data in order to assess the outcome of planning. New communities such as Huilongguan are popping up throughout China. Many of these new communities face similar problems as Huilongguan. By evaluating {{the quality of life in}} Huilongguan, effective methods can be discovered for decision makers and planners to alleviate such problems. by Meng Ren. Thesis: M. C.

In this paper, we model self-organization in social tagging systems and illustrate the underlying interaction and dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a model in which individuals adjust their own tagging tendency to imitate the average tagging tendency. We found that when users are of low confidence, they tend to imitate others and lead to a self-organized state with active tagging. On the other hand, when users are of high confidence and are stubborn for changes, tagging becomes inactive. We observe a phase transition at a critical level of user confidence when the system changes from one regime to the other.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} constructing a proxy-based overlay skeleton tree (POST) in the backbone service domain of a two-tier overlay multicast infrastructure. Spanning all multicast proxies deployed in the overlay backbone, POST acts as an efficient resource sharing platform for supporting large numbers of concurrent multicast sessions, without the need of tree computation for each individual session. The problem is concerned with deciding an appropriate deployment of multicast proxies in the overlay backbone, upon which we wish to find an optimal POST solution so that the maximum end-to-end latency is minimized subject to degree balancing constraints. This problem is shown to be NP-hard. We present a simple heuristic method for deploying multicast proxies, and devise a low complexity greedy algorithm for optimizing the end-toend latency and degree <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>POST.</b> Simulation experiments confirm that our proposed approach yields good quality approximate solutions that {{are close to the}} optimum. ...|$|R

A multivariate regression and analysis of covariance approach is unbiased but shows power deficiencies in a simulation study.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{analysed}} the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> mortem DNA damage derived miscoding lesions {{from the}} datasets of seven published Neandertal specimens that have extensive cloned sequence coverage over the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region 1 (HVS 1). The analysis {{was restricted to}} C→T and G→A miscoding lesions (the predominant manifestation <b>of</b> <b>post</b> mortem damage) that are seen at a frequency {{of more than one}} clone among sequences from a single PCR, but do not represent the true endogenous sequence. Findings The data indicates an extreme bias towards C→T over G→A miscoding lesions (observed ratio of 67 : 2 compared to an expected ratio of 7 : 2), implying that the mtDNA Light strand molecule suffers proportionally more damage-derived miscoding lesions than the Heavy strand. Conclusion The clustering of Cs in the Light strand as opposed to the singleton pattern of Cs in the Heavy strand could explain the observed bias, a phenomenon that could be further tested with non-PCR based approaches. The characterization of the HVS 1 hotspots will be of use to future Neandertal mtDNA studies, with specific regards to assessing the authenticity of new positions previously unknown to be polymorphic. </p...|$|R

40|$|Hypotheses on the {{dynamics}} of dispersed prices are extracted from computer simulations, as well as traditional and recent theory. The hypotheses are tested on existing laboratory data. As predicted in some variations of the Edgeworth hypothesis, the laboratory data exhibit a significant cycle. Relative to the unique stationary distribution, the empirical <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>posted</b> prices has excess mass in an interval that moves downward over time until it approaches the lower boundary <b>of</b> the stationary <b>distribution.</b> Then the excess mass jumps upward and the downward cycle resumes. The amplitude of the cycle seems fairly constant over the longer experimental sessions. Of the simulations we consider, the one closest to Edgeworth’s 1925 account, a hybrid of gradient dynamics and logit dynamics, seems to best reproduce the observed dynamics.

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{patterns of}} productivity in the Internet mailing lists, {{also known as}} discussion lists or discussion groups. Datasets have been collected from electronic archives of two Internet mailing lists, the LINGUIST and the History of the English Language. Theoretical models widely used in informetric research have been applied to fit the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>posted</b> mes-sages over the population of authors. The Generalized Inverse Poisson-Gaussian and Poisson-lognormal distributions show excellent results in both datasets, while Lotka and Yule–Simon distribution demonstrate poor-to-mediocre fits. In the mailing list where modera-tion and quality control are enforced to a higher degree, i. e., the LINGUIST, Lotka, and Yule–Simon distributions perform better. The findings can be plausibly explained by the lesser applicability of the success-breeds-success model to the information production in the elec-tronic communication media, such as Internet mailing lists, where selectivity of publications is marginal or nonexistent. The hypothesis is preliminary, {{and needs to be}} validated against the larger variety of datasets. Char-acteristics of the quality control, competitiveness, and the reward structure in Internet mailing lists as com-pared to professional scholarly journals are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background. We have {{analysed}} the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> mortem DNA damage derived miscoding lesions {{from the}} datasets of seven published Neandertal specimens that have extensive cloned sequence coverage over the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region 1 (HVS 1). The analysis {{was restricted to}} C → T and G → A miscoding lesions (the predominant manifestation <b>of</b> <b>post</b> mortem damage) that are seen at a frequency {{of more than one}} clone among sequences from a single PCR, but do not represent the true endogenous sequence. Findings. The data indicates an extreme bias towards C → T over G → A miscoding lesions (observed ratio of 67 : 2 compared to an expected ratio of 7 : 2), implying that the mtDNA Light strand molecule suffers proportionally more damage-derived miscoding lesions than the Heavy strand. Conclusion. The clustering of Cs in the Light strand as opposed to the singleton pattern of Cs in the Heavy strand could explain the observed bias, a phenomenon that could be further tested with non-PCR based approaches. The characterization of the HVS 1 hotspots will be of use to future Neandertal mtDNA studies, with specific regards to assessing the authenticity of new positions previously unknown to be polymorphic...|$|R
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{feasibility}} of two scenarios of phase transition signals, that is, the flashing green together with red–yellow light and the green countdown together with red countdown, at signalized intersections in terms of e-bike rider behavior. An evaluation framework is first proposed. During the phase transition, the stop-go and start-up behavioral parameters are collected at four intersections in Shanghai, China. Sensitivity analysis is then performed to identify the most significant factors that influence the occurrence of traffic conflicts during the phase transition. Based on the above analysis results, case studies were finally done to look into safety performance of the two scenarios of phase transition signals, indicated by the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> encroachment time at the conflict point and the occurring probability <b>of</b> extremely small <b>post</b> encroachment times. Research result shows the transition signal combination of green countdown[*]+[*]red countdown tends to cause traffic accidents more easily and thus less safe compared to the transition signal combination of flashing green[*]+[*]red-yellow. Unlike the conventional method generally based on the deterministic traffic flow theory, the proposed methodology has a wide application. With the aid of it, traffic engineers are capable of designing transition signals in a more scientific manner...|$|R

This article uses data on the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> leadership <b>posts</b> in Russia’s regional legislatures (1999 – 2010) to conduct the first systematic test of this proposition. Loyalty to the nascent hegemonic party, United Russia, is shown {{to be important in}} determining a legislator’s chances of being promoted to a leadership position. These findings generate insight into how authoritarian institutions help maintain regime stability and provide a clearer picture of how Russia’s ruling party works...|$|R

We show in this paper that “less rational ” sellers {{are not able to}} learn this Nash-equilibrium pricing rule through adaptation and repeated interactions. The strategy of sellers can be summed by the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>posted</b> prices. Using an analytical model characterized by consumers using a fixed-sample size searching rule, we first define the variance and mean <b>of</b> this price <b>distribution.</b> We then compare the characteristics <b>of</b> this Nash-theoretical <b>distribution</b> with the one obtained through a reinforcement learning process. Interestingly, we show that the qualitative properties of the Nash search equilibrium (NSE) of changes in the market structure are still valid for the RL distribution. That is, mean price and variance exhibit similar variations to a change in the degree of information of consumers. Key words: search market equilibrium – reinforcement learning process – fixed sample size search strategy – numerical computatio...|$|R
40|$|Recently several {{works have}} {{appeared}} in the literature in which authors try to describe Freeze Out (FO) in energetic heavy ion collisions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). The aim of this work is to point out the limitations of the BTE, when applied for the modeling of FO or other very fast process, and to propose the way how the BTE approach can be generalized for such a processes. The Freeze Out (FO) is an important phase of dynamical reactions. The FO is a kinetic process and thus the phase-space (PS) <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> FO particles can be obtained from kinetic FO calculations. The connection of the kinetic description of this process and the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) raised considerable attention recently [1, 2]. One would think that FO can be handled perfectly by using the BTE, which may describe both equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes in a 4 -dimensional space-time (ST) volume element like FO layer. Our aim is to analyse the situation and point out the physical causes, which limit the applicability of the BTE for describing FO and some other processes [3]. FO is usually assumed to happen on sharp 3 -dimensional ST hypersurfaces. However...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we explore how the {{management}} of governing coalitions and attributes {{of the dynamics of}} the conflict between and within governing and opposition coalitions affect obstructionist movements in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies from 1991 to 2010. Obstructionist movements are operationalized by the percentage of monthly roll call votes related to procedural requirements that delay decisions on legislative proposals. We find that the proportionality in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> ministerial <b>posts</b> reduces obstruction in minority coalitions. In larger coalitions, this type of incentive has little effect in reducing obstructionist moves. Smaller, more cohesive, and better managed governing coalitions are more capable than oversized coalitions of diminishing problems for decision making in the Chamber of Deputies.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Setting a {{price that}} results in {{rationing}} may be optimal for a seller whose customers must make a specific investment {{to be able to}} use his product. Although rationing results in ex post inefficiency, the resulting <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> ex <b>post</b> surplus compensates consumers for their transaction-specific costs, while allowing the seller to earn higher profits than with market-clearing prices. Committing to a single price, and rationing if there is excess demand, can be more profitable than setting state-contingent prices that always clear the market. Variants of our basic model provide insights into overbooking practices by the airline industry, declining price paths combined with rationing to favour loyal customers, discriminatory pricing arrangements, second-sourcing, and sticky wages.
