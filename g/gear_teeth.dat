5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E

40|$|Regarding <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method <b>Gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus. Therefore, the y-position of the stylus represents the output quantity. Other quantities (stylus x-position, stylus z-position, and <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface position) represent the input quantities. Accordingly, if we search for a point on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface whose x-coordinate and z-coordinate are equal to x- and z-position of the stylus, the y-coordinate of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface should be equal to the y-position of the stylus. We can apply the Monte Carlo method to this procedure, thus evaluating the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape measurement uncertainty. The factors of the uncertainties being considered are shown in Table 1, and the simulation conditions are listed in Table 2.

Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments.

500|$|B11, now {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Gravener, encountered an Austro-Hungarian seaplane on 11 November {{that had been}} forced down by engine trouble. B11 attempted to engage the seaplane with the one Maxim gun she had aboard, but it jammed almost immediately and Gravener attempted to ram the aircraft. The Austrians managed to restart their engine, however, and flew off, easily avoiding Gravener's ramming attempt. On 17 January B11 encountered another seaplane with engine trouble. This time the Austrians were unable to repair their engine and were captured. B9 was spotted by an Austrian seaplane on 29 March and eventually forced to dive after both sides failed to damage each other with machine gun fire. B7 had a narrow escape off the Austrian naval base at Pola three months later when she was damaged by another seaplane that jammed her diving planes in the [...] "hard to rise" [...] position which meant she could not submerge until they were repaired. Both B8 and B11 were missed by torpedoes fired by Austrian submarines in early 1916. On one patrol the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> of B11s steering mechanism were stripped which made the rudder loose and the boat unsteerable. Relieving tackles were rigged, despite the heavy seas, but they parted under the strain after 15 minutes. Slowly the boat began to drift towards the enemy coast, but a northwesterly breeze sprang up before dawn and the seas moderated which allowed her to make about [...] by going astern.

[...] Because the baitcasting reel uses the weight and momentum of the lure to pull the line from the rotating spool, it normally requires lures weighing 1/4 oz. or more in order to cast a significant distance. [...] Recent developments have seen bait casting reels with gear ratios as high as 7.1/1.
