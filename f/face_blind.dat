2500|$|At Patuxent River on April 1, 1952, Carl {{had a close}} {{brush with}} death. He was {{performing}} a series of check spins in the new Grumman AF-2S Guardian anti-submarine attack aircraft.

5000|$|During the stadium's {{original}} baseball years, {{the field}} became notorious for its poor drainage {{and its configuration}} that had batters <b>facing</b> <b>blinding</b> sunlight when a game was played near sunset, which forced baseball games to be suspended until the sun set below the horizon.

5000|$|Rootabaga Stories (1922) is a children's book of interrelated {{short stories}} by Carl Sandburg. The whimsical, {{sometimes}} melancholy stories, which often use nonsense language, were originally created {{for his own}} daughters. Sandburg had three daughters, Margaret, Janet and Helga, whom he nicknamed [...] "Spink", [...] "Skabootch" [...] and [...] "Swipes" [...] -those nicknames occur {{in some of his}} Rootabaga stories. The [...] "Rootabaga" [...] stories were born of Sandburg's desire for [...] "American fairy tales" [...] to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so set his stories in a fictionalized American Midwest called [...] "the Rootabaga country" [...] filled with farms, trains, and corn fairies. A large number of the stories are told by the Potato <b>Face</b> <b>Blind</b> Man, an old minstrel of the Village of Liver-and-Onions who hangs {{out in front of the}} local post office. His impossibly acquired firsthand knowledge of the stories adds to the book's narrative feel and fantastical nature. In the Preface of the little-known Potato Face, Sandburg wrote, [...] "it is in Rootabaga Country, and in the biggest village of that country, the Potato <b>Face</b> <b>Blind</b> Man sits with his accordion on the corner nearest the post office. There he sits with his eyes never looking out and always searching in. And sometimes he finds in himself the whole human procession." ...|$|E
5000|$|To {{speed up}} his cooking, Wallace {{activates}} the Autochef, a robot chef with a tea nozzle, {{a frying pan}} and a temperature gauge. He has it cook scrambled eggs, but they end up on Gromit's head instead of a plate. Next Wallace tries to fry eggs, but the Autochef throws them onto Wallace's <b>face,</b> <b>blinding</b> him. As it goes haywire and starts to squirt hot tea around the room, Gromit blocks the nozzle with a banana. The pressure buildup causes the Autochef's head to explode (after comically saying [...] "knickers") and tear the room apart, and Wallace decides to have a continental breakfast the next day.|$|R

Then I bent over it, slowly undoing the rimpis with which it was tied, while the sweat of terror ran down by <b>face</b> <b>blinding</b> me like tears. What would I do if he saw the child? What if the child awoke and cried? I would snatch the assegai from his hand and stab him! Yes, I would kill the king and then kill myself! Now the mat was unrolled. Inside were the brown leaves and roots of medicine; beneath them was the {{senseless}} bade wrapped in dead moss.|$|R
