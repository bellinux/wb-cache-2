40|$|Recent {{evidence}} about the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> class size on academic achievementfrom randomized experiments points to positive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> small classes. However, the {{evidence about}} the mechanism producing these effects is less clear. Some scholars have arguedfor mechanisms that would imply greater <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> small classes for low-achieving students. This article investigates possible differential <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> small classes on achievement using data from Project STAR, a four-year, large-scale randomized experiment on the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> class size. We examined the differential <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> small classes for students in the bottom half and bottom quarter, respectively, of their class's achievement distribution in kindergarten. Although small class effects are somewhat largerfor low-achieving students in reading, the differential effects (in-teractions) are not statistically significant. Moreover, the small class effects for low-achieving students in mathematics are actually smaller than those for higher achieving students. Thus while there are un-ambiguous positive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> small classes on achievement, {{there is no evidence}} for differentially larger <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> small classes for lower achieving students...|$|R
