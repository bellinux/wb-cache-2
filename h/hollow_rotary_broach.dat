5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and <b>rotary.</b> In linear <b>broaching,</b> which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to <b>broach.</b> In <b>rotary</b> <b>broaching,</b> the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A <b>rotary</b> <b>broach</b> is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|R
5|$|In general, a <b>rotary</b> <b>broach</b> {{will not}} cut as {{accurately}} as a push or pull broach. However, {{the ability to}} use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly advantageous.|$|R
5000|$|Hex {{socket screw}} heads are usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear <b>broaching</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>broaching.</b> Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
40|$|Process {{improvements}} {{for cutting}} {{external and internal}} polygons inbone screwsThis project intends to bring processes on the Swiss machine, including polygonturning and <b>rotary</b> <b>broaching</b> respectively and an integrated process of the both, to ahigher level of improvements on precision and efficiency. In {{the first year of}} this project, a multi-point cutting is proposed for externalpolygon turning. In comparison with the traditional single-point cutting, the proposedmethod involves a tool shaped with several cutting points, such that severalsimultaneous generated cutting trajectories are able to cut a required polygon moreclosely than with a single cutting point. In the second year, an automatic alignment twice feed method is proposed forrotary broaching to generate exact internal polygon. The method involves a design ofa special shaped tool, which enables automatic alignment at the beginning for the toolinsertion of the second feed. Traditional <b>rotary</b> <b>broaching</b> needs to pre-drill a holesurpassing the polygon boundary, this innovative process requires only the pre-drilledhole just reaching the polygonal boundary. In the third year, a new method will be proposed for a synchronous integration ofpolygon turning and <b>rotary</b> <b>broaching.</b> In a single stroke, this process can complete thecontour of a workpiece coexisting with a non-equilateral external polygon and aninternal polygon. The process will be tested on a highest level Swiss machine(equipped 12 axes, three systems, three turrets and two spindles) for cutting dynamichip lag screws. 骨釘之內外多邊形切削程序的改善本計畫將對於在瑞士型車床上的骨釘加工程序，多邊形車削與旋轉拉孔的個別切削製程及兩者的整合程序，進行高精度與高效率切削的製程改善。本計畫的第一年提出多點切削的方法來進行外多邊形車削。有別於傳統的單點切削，所提方法是設計一個具有多個刀尖點之刀具來進行切削．因為會同時產生多個刀尖軌跡，可達到比單點切削更精確的多邊形。計畫的第二年，針對旋轉拉孔提出自動對位的二次進刀方法以加工出更精確的內多邊形。將設計一特殊的刀具，此刀具將可在第一次進給拉孔切削完成後，在第二次進給切削時能自動對位。傳統的旋轉拉孔所需的預鑽孔徑必須大於設計的多邊形邊界，而這方法的預鑽孔徑只需要到達所設計的多邊形邊界即可。計畫的第三年，將研發出一套新方法，可以整合旋轉拉孔和多邊形車削做同步加工。單一加工行程即可完成具有內多邊形及不等邊外多邊形之複雜工序。該計畫將在最高階的瑞士型車床上（含 12 軸，三系統，三刀塔及雙主軸) ，以動態髖部拉力骨釘為對象，進行測試...|$|R
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a <b>rotary</b> <b>broach</b> or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous <b>broaching,</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>broaching.</b> Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>broaching</b> {{is another}} common operation. The broach holder is mounted {{stationary}} while its internal live spindle and end cutting broach tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a hexagonal socket {{in the end of}} a cap screw.|$|R
500|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>broaching</b> {{requires}} two tooling {{components: a}} tool holder and a broach. The leading (cutting) {{edge of the}} broach has a contour matching the desired final shape. The broach is mounted in a special tool holder that allows it to freely rotate. The tool holder is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1°. This angle is what produces a rotating edge for the broach to cut the workpiece. Either the workpiece or the tool holder is rotated. If the tool holder is rotated, the misalignment causes the broach to appear as though it is [...] "wobbling", which is {{the origin of the}} term wobble broach.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new inside-laser coaxial wire feeding {{processing}} {{is adopted}} that can ensure a good axiality between wire and laser beam through transmitting wire along the {{centerline of the}} laser beam. Basing on the optimization of process parameters and single beads cladding experiments, {{the causes of the}} uneven surface of the formed part is analyzed. By putting forward a method of the real-time control of the defocusing amount and the laser power, a fine multi-layer <b>hollow</b> <b>rotary</b> part is formed. The formed part has no subsidence damage and crack on the whole cladding layer. The size of the error is small and the hardness of the laser cladding is uniformly distributed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept and}} field testing of a <b>hollow,</b> cast-in-situ, <b>rotary</b> bored pile foundation 1200 mm diameter and 30 m deep. The aim of the foundation is to allow large-diameter piles to be constructed using less concrete than in an equivalent conventional solid pile, and {{with a view to}} allowing reuse at a later date. Reuse is made possible because the hollow core of the pile allows access for inspection after demolition of an existing structure. The new piles may also allow modification to enhance load capacity by augering through the base and extending their length. In addition, the piles are better suited than conventional piles for use as ‘energy piles' to allow environmentally friendly heating and cooling. The geotechnical performance of the hollow test pile was comparable with that of a conventional solid pile constructed during the same trial. Details of construction are given, including lessons learned...|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{delivery}} mechanism for ISCO is through perforated, hollow metal rods hammered {{into the ground}} by [...] "direct-push" [...] drilling methods or by injecting the oxidant into wells installed using <b>hollow</b> stem auger, <b>rotary</b> drilling methods. One advantage of injection wells {{is that they can}} be used for multiple applications of the oxidant material, while direct push injection techniques are generally quicker and less expensive. Injection wells for ozone are typically constructed of a 1-2" [...] stainless-steel screen set in sand pack, grouted to the surface using a combination of cement and bentonite clay. Often, a field pilot study must be performed to determine injection parameters and well spacing.|$|R
40|$|Quenching {{cooling rate}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>hollow</b> {{cylinder}} by one row of water impinging jets has been experimentallystudied. Water jets (d = 8 mm) with sub-cooling 55 to 85 °C and Reynolds number 8, 006 to 36, 738 impinged over rotaryhot hollow cylinder (rotation speed 10 to 70 rpm) with initial temperature 250 to 600 °C. Impingement impact angle of row of jets varied between 0 to 135 ° and jet-to-jet spacing in row patten was 2 to 8 d. The results revealed more uniformityon cooling rate of quenching in smaller jet-to-jet spacing (2 and 4 d) where wetting front regions are located closer toneighbor jet’s region. By increasing spacing, footprint of annular transition region was highlighted in quenching coolingrate contour. A distinct quenching characteristic was obtained for impingement impact angle of 0 ° compare to otherangles. With initial temperature above the Leidenfrost temperature, low cooling rate was achieved in film and transitionboiling compare to a steep increase of cooling rate at start of quenching with higher maximum heat transfer for experimentswith initial temperatures less than Leidenfrost temperature. The effect of other parameters on quenching coolingrate was highlighted in film and transition boiling while {{no significant differences}} were observed in nucleate boiling.

40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} (crimping machine) is a machine designed for making <b>hollow</b> forgings. The <b>rotary</b> compressor is a prototype device {{designed and built}} at the Technical University of Lublin. The compressor is dedicated to perform laboratory tests related to the hollow forgings of various shapes using different materials. Since the {{rotary compressor}} is an experimental device, there is no control and acquisition data system available. The article presents the concept and {{the capabilities of the}} computer control and data acquisition system supporting rotary compressing process. The main task of software system is acquisition of force and kinetic parameters related to the analysed process of the rotary forging compression. The software allows the user to declare the course of the forming forgings. This system allows current recording and analysis of four physical values: feed rate (speed of working head movement), hydraulic oil pressure at inlet and outlet of hydraulic cylinder and the torque of engine. Application functions can be divided into three groups: the configuration of the pressing process, the acquisition and analysis of data from the pressing process and the recording and presentation of stored results. The article contains a detailed description about hardware and software implementation of mentioned functions...|$|R
