50|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> is an {{important}} species for fisheries in east Asia. South Korea is the country reporting the biggest annual catches, followed by Japan and Taiwan. These added to a relatively modest total catch of about 56,000 tonnes in 2009. However, China reports very large catches of unidentified seerfish (Scomberomorus spp., fluctuating around 400,000 tonnes in 2000-2009), without reporting catches of any single Scomberomorus species. It is likely that these catches include {{a significant proportion of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>{{mackerel}}</b> (Scomberomorus niphonius) {{also known}} as the Japanese seerfish, is a species of true mackerel in the scombrid family (Scombridae). Their maximum reported length is 100 cm, and the maximum reported weight is 10.57 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The literal {{translation}} of the toponym is [...] "Japanese Spanish mackerel arc". The local fishermen began to fish here since the early Qing dynasty, as the coast shaped like an arc and the coastal waters are rich in <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> ("bayu" [...] in Chinese), thus, the area is named after [...] "Bayuquan".|$|E

40|$|Spearing <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> {{one of the}} {{traditional}} fishing technique in Japan, is very interesting from the view point of fishing technology because of its primitive but highly developed luring fish technique. In spearing <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> relatively large lure and luring model fish with {{same size as the}} <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> are used to attact fish up to sea surface at the spearing position. <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> is attracted by these luring gears, and its behaviour toward them varies depending on the size, movement and moving speed of the luring gear. Though <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> attracted actively tries to feed on a lure, it comes near the luring model fish which made of wood or cloth and stays around it recognizing the model fish as a schooling companion...|$|R
50|$|Migratory and oceanic {{species that}} breed {{on the islands}} include such as Laysan albatross, Black-winged stilt, tuna, {{skipjack}} tuna, <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> marlin, manta rays, Japanese spiny lobster, sea turtles, dolphins and Humpback whales. Among Ryukyu Islands, green pheasant is only present on Daitō Islands followed by corals and coral fish that are rare {{in the rest of}} the archipelago most notably Chaetodon auripes which is occasionally regarded as endemic to the islands and Hemitaurichthys thompsoni was only previously recorded in Bonin Islands. Black Jacks and knifejaws that have become rarer in Japanese waters still occur as well.|$|E
50|$|The Australian spotted {{mackerel}} (Scomberomorus munroi) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Scombridae. Common fork length ranges between 50 and 80 cm. Specimens have been recorded at up to 104 cm in length, and weighing up to 10.2 kg. It {{is found in the}} western Pacific, along the northern coast of Australia, from the Abrolhos Islands region of Western Australia to Coffs Harbour and Kempsey in central New South Wales. It is also found in southern Papua New Guinea from Kerema to Port Moresby. It feeds largely on fishes, particularly anchovies and sardines, with smaller quantities of shrimps and squids. It is sometimes confused with <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> S. niphonius. Conservation status of the species has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN.|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [40776097, 31061160187]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2009 AA 09 Z 401]We {{isolated}} and characterized 21 polymorphic microsatellite loci in <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus niphonius) using a (GT) (13) -enriched genomic library.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the relationships among}} larval and juvenile abundance and catch per unit fishing effort (CPUE) of subsequent 1 -year-old <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the central Seto Inland Sea, Japan, from 1995 to 1999 {{to test the hypothesis}} that year-class strength of the mackerel is determined by the juvenile stage. There was no significant correlation between larval and juvenile abundance while juvenile abundance was positively correlated with CPUE of subsequent 1 -year-old fish, indicating that year-class strength was determined by early juvenile stage. Mean larval growth rate estimated by otolith microstructure ranged between 0. 43 and 0. 92 mm day- 1. There was a significant positive correlation between prey fish (clupeiform larvae) abundance and mean growth rate of the mackerel larvae. The fish prey abundance during peak occurrence period of the mackerel larvae was higher in 1995 and 1999 than in the other three years. The larval growth rates were significantly higher and strong year-class occurred in 1995 and 1999. The larval abundance was highest, but the juvenile abundance was lowest in 1997, indicating higher mortality during larval period in this year. We concluded that fish prey availability {{is one of the most}} important determinants for growth and survival of <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> larvae, which are almost completely piscivorous from their first feeding stage...|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{eggs and}} larvae and feeding {{and growth of}} larvae of <b>Japanese</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus niphonius) were {{investigated}} {{in relation to their}} prey in the Sea of Hiuchi, the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, in 1995 and 1996. The abundance of S. niphonius eggs and larvae peaked in late May, corresponding with that of clupeid larvae, the major prey organisms of S. niphonius larvae. The eggs were abundant in the northwestern waters and the larvae were abundant in the southern waters in late May in both years, indicating a southward drift during egg and yolksac stages by residual f low in {{the central part of the}} Sea of Hiuchi. Abundance of clupeid larvae in southern waters, where S. niphonius larvae were abundant, may indicate a spawning strategy on the part of first-feeding S. niphonius larvae to encounter the spatial and temporal peak in ichthyoplankton prey abundance in the Seto Inland Sea. Abundance of the clupeid larvae was higher in 1995 than in 1996. Feeding incidence (percentage of stomachs with food; 85. 3...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To utilize low-value fish, <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein was hydrolyzed using alcalase for {{production}} of antioxidant peptide. The antioxidant activities of antioxidant peptide from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein were evaluated. Results: The radical-scavenging properties on hydroxyl and superoxide of protein hydrolysates were 53. 11 % and 23. 1 %. And their reducing power was increased with the peptide {{content of the}} hydrolysates. The hydrolysates significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation in linoleic acid emulsion system, and effectively inhibit autoxidation of linoleic acid; and the inhibition ability increased with the increasing of peptide content in hydrolysates. The hydrolysates inhibited the activity of LOX to a certain extent. Conclusion: The hydrolysates from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein exhibited high antioxidative activity...|$|R
