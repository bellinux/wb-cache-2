5|$|A {{major change}} <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Two</b> Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Two</b> Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

5|$|Achelousaurus {{is known}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Two</b> Medicine Formation, which {{preserves}} coastal sediments {{dating from the}} Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 83and74million years ago.

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> major {{species can}} be divided into two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|After {{the brigade}} had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by {{renumbering}} {{those in the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Parachute Battalion, the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion the 3rd Parachute Battalion. Finally, in July 1948, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade Group, taking its one and six numbers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> wartime divisions.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Final Fantasy I, Uematsu {{remained}} with the series to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy II (1988). Although I and II were composed separately, music <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> games have only been released on albums together. These albums include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. Final Fantasy III (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded {{as one of the}} best soundtracks of any NES game. The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them.

He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E

Menage appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1886, however the lower court's decision was upheld.|$|E

5|$|Goodwin {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} in 1992 that Styracosaurus {{was part of}} the lineage leading to Einiosaurus, Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. This was based on a series of fossil skulls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Two</b> Medicine Formation of Montana. The position of Styracosaurus in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that were thought to represent Styracosaurus have been transferred to the genus Rubeosaurus.|$|E
