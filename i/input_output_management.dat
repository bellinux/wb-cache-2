It {{points out that the}} present evaluation method invisibly weakens high eco-sensitivity areas and unsafe areas, and therefore the evaluation process can not objectively reflect the different angles of urban land use and its contradiction and unity. Thus, the article suggests strengthening the idea of giving priority to ecology and city safety through analyzing key sensitive factors and perfecting multi-factor superposition method. It explores a new idea for land suitability evaluation from three angles, that is, eco-sensitivity evaluation, construction suitability evaluation and city safety. An empirical study is conducted on the master planning of Hongya County Town. Research Background GIS is a new technology developed in mid- 1960 s. As a computer system, it combines computer science, geography, surveying, cartography and many other subjects, deals with the <b>input,</b> <b>output,</b> <b>management,</b> query, analysis of the geographical data and assists decision-making. The application of GIS technology to urban researches started from 1970 s abroad and from mid- 1980 s at home.

These source listings appear in the same format as utilized and required by the C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) expert system shell which {{is the basis for}} the ONAV entry system. A schematic overview is given of how the rules are organized. These groups result from a partitioning of the rules according to the overall function which a given set of rules performs. This partitioning was established and maintained according to that established in the knowledge specification document. In addition, four other groups of rules are specified. The four groups (control flow, operator <b>inputs,</b> <b>output</b> <b>management,</b> and data tables) perform functions that affect all the other functional rule groups. As the name implies, control flow ensures that the rule groups are executed in the order required for proper operation; operator input rules control the introduction into the CLIPS fact base of various kinds of data required by the expert system; <b>output</b> <b>management</b> rules control the updating of the ONAV expert system user display screen during execution of the system; and data tables are static information utilized by many different rule sets gathered in one convenient place...|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys {{empirical}} studies that utilize {{the theory of}} the firm and dual theory to reveal economic and technological conditions of fish harvesting firms. The dual approach is highly suitable for revealing disaggregated structures in fishing processes that consist of several <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> Building on the functional forms of cost, profit, or revenue functions, the dual approach has improved our understanding of technological production conditions based on data at firm level. This is done by addressing a variety of different technological issues for multispecies harvesting firms, such as transformation between species, substitution between fishing inputs, economies of scope and scale, industrial organization, etc. Moreover, the approach has been useful as a means of providing information in public management of resource exploitation by dealing with various regulatory regimes, i. e., <b>input</b> <b>management,</b> <b>output</b> <b>management,</b> and prospects for future regulation.

40|$|Models used in {{catchment}} prediction {{have often}} been developed for specific research problems or locations by individuals using software engineering practices that are now considered obsolete. The legacy {{of this is a}} range of models dealing with similar problems, using similar data <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> interpretation, but with a high diversity of operational features. Modern catchment management requires that policy development, planning and intervention be undertaken in an integrated fashion, with consideration given to physical, ecological, economic and social systems. Integrated catchment modelling offers managers some support in meeting these needs, although the range of different languages, platforms, and design approaches used in existing models means that integrated modelling can not be done by simply plugging together existing models. A modelling framework is being developed that covers not only module design and specification, but also relevant protocols for user involvement, testing and comparison, documentation, calibration and validation, and verification and peer review. This framework will be used by the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology as a basis for integration of appropriate existing modules and newly developed modules into a catchment prediction toolkit. A benefit of this approach is that researchers and modellers can spend more time on core module development, and less or no time on <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>management.</b> Other benefits include...|$|R
40|$|If the {{technology}} in a multi-species fishery is such that there is jointness in inputs and non-separability between <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs,</b> then <b>management</b> on a species-by-species basis may lead to unintended outcomes, including over-exploitation of the resource. This study investigates {{the nature of the}} technical and economic relationships underlying the 1989 - 1990 Mauritanian cephalopod fishery by estimating a system of dual output supply functions derived from a generalized Leontief revenue function. Model results indicate the existence of jointness in inputs and non-separability between <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs</b> in the fishery. Cross-price elasticities indicated a number of substitute and complementary relationships, with these relationships changing in magnitude across years. Taken together, the results suggest that any attempts to economically manage the resource should be based on multi-product production theory, not single-species biological response functions. Besides ruling out single-species management, the dominance of substitute relationships in the Mauritanian cephalopod fishery precludes the use of "key species" management of the entire resource. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The TAOS {{system is}} an integrated, scalable, modular {{meteorological}} hazard model designed to assist emergency managers, land use planners and meteorologists {{in assessing the}} risks associated with meteorological hazards. An object-oriented approach to model design enables the user to select the methods most appropriate to the problem, or the use of multiple methods to create an ensemble approach. The modular approach enables the rapid integration and testing of new or experimental techniques. Use of a graphical user interface hides the underlying complexity of storm hazard modeling from users with minimal numerical modeling background, while enabling the experienced user to interact with the model at a detailed level. Integrated tools for real-time tracking, track forecasting, and modeling of storm effects are provided, as well as probabilistic tools for assessing the risk of both real time, seasonal, and overall historical risks. The integration of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology as both the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>management</b> basis for the model allows rapid update of input data bases, and the virtually instantaneous interaction of hazard data with existing planning data such as structure type, value, and location, population, and zoning. Verification data is described for various aspects of the model. TAOS has been used operationally for projects in Central America, the Caribbean, and th...|$|R

Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher Ideal, and Törnqvist-Theil index number procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91. The data file also includes various <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> subaggregates (see table 1 from Acquaye, Alston, and Pardey, appended below, for details) and the value shares using prices from the current and past period that are required to reconstruct all these indexes for all the spatial units reported in the paper. Documentation of the primary data files constructed by Craig, Pardey, and Acquaye is also available in the file named Index Number Construction The Laspeyres and Paasche indexes are not chain-linked indexes—they use base-period and current prices and quantities, respectively in the calculation.

40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) stock is {{controlled}} by many factors, but for given conditions it is the long term summation of the balance between <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> <b>Management</b> practices will alter this balance by affecting the system’s productivity and the speed of residue and soil organic matter decomposition. Given that annual changes in SOC are generally small, compared with the large and variable SOC background, long-term experiments, and soil samples taken {{at the start of}} experiments (archived samples) are necessary to determine SOC trends over time. Changes in SOC were analyzed for two long-term experiments; one an irrigated site at Mead, NE (1997) with continuous corn (CC) (Zea mays L.) and corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] (CS) rotation) and 3 nitrogen (N) application rates (0, 100 and 300 kg ha- 1); and the other a rainfed site at Concord, NE, (1985) with three tillage treatments (no-till, NT, disk, DK, and moldboard plow, MP), two crop sequences (CC and CS) and three N application rates (0, 80 and 160 kg ha- 1). Soil samples taken at early stages of the experiments were used as a benchmark to analyze carbon trends over time. Results showed that in spite of considerable differences, C inputs did not affect changes in SOC. Nitrogen fertilizer application resulted in a 3 % increase in SOC, but required 24 years to generate detectable differences in the surface 400 kg of soil m- 2. Over the last 12 years, MP lost 1. 52 ± 0. 4 kg of C m- 2 while NT lost 0. 73 ± 0. 4 and DK lost 0. 76 ± 0. 4 kg of C m- 2 in the 1200 kg of soil m- 2 profile. None of the evaluated treatments under the conditions of these experiments were able to sequester atmospheric C since all lost SOC over time. The use of archived samples made possible the determination of the rate of SOC change over time, and allowed an accounting for natural soil variability...|$|R
