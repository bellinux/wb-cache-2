40|$|Professor Cadogan at the University of the West Indies {{identified}} special {{starting points}} that yield long subsequences where the normalization constant, k, is always one.

Such cycles only occur among extremely large numbers, causing the equation {{to be difficult to}} solve numerically. Comment: Write me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> a copy of the Mathematica program I used to search against the constraint. There are some variations for the closed form on other cases, write <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> those. This work was done while I was visiting at the University of the West Indies this summer. I truly enjoyed meeting Dr. Cadogan and studying his Collatz conjecture proof...|$|R
