40|$|Abstract—Future {{advanced}} driver assistant {{systems and}} auto-mated driving put high {{demands on the}} environmental perception especially in urban environments. Major tasks are <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> static and dynamic elements along with the drivable area and road structures. Although these tasks can be done without an explicit representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground surface, evaluations with real-world sensor data have shown that many failures in sensor data interpretation result from inappropriate ground point filtering, e. g. false negative or false positive detection of objects. That means, the ground plane estimation becomes a key-task in urban environment modeling assuming a reliable perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local vehicle’s surroundings is required. In this paper we thus present <b>the</b> <b>enhancements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> modeling that {{can be derived from}} an explicit representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground surface. We propose <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> channel-wise ground classification with a grid-based representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground height to cope with spatial false measurements and exploit inter-channel dependency. Partial occlusions by other road users are handled in an efficient way. Integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground data is shown by a pitch angle estimation and a curb detection module.

Deep geologic disposal provides the logical solution as ever more categories of waste are barred from long-term disposal in near-surface sites through regulation and litigation. Past mining in the US has left in its wake large volumes of suitable underground space. EPA studies and foreign practice have demonstrated deep geologic disposal in mines to be rational and viable. In the US, {{where much of the}} mined underground space is located on public lands, disposal in mines would also serve the goal of multiple use.

40|$|ABSTRACT.

Although some forms of augmented feedback {{have been shown to}} enhance performance on isolated isometric tasks during training, when the feedback has been removed subjects have sometimes not been able to perform as well in the "realworld" task as controls. Indeed, for realistic, nonisometric motor tasks, improved skill acquisition because of augmented feedback has not been demonstrated. In the present experiments, subjects (Experiment 1, N = 42; Experiment 2, N = 21) performed with a system that was designed for teaching a difficult multijoint movement in a table tennis environment. The system was a fairly realistic computer animation of the environment and included paddles for the teacher and subject, as well as a virtual ball. Each subjec...|$|E

Raven paid close attention to improving all guns in the game because, as a developer explained, [...] "We needed to take the weapons up to <b>the</b> same level <b>of</b> personality as <b>the</b> characters"; each received better dynamics, alterations made to their firing mechanisms, and a new feature in the series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon.
