5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

500|$|Keith had {{originally}} recorded the song {{near the end}} of his contract with Mercury Records Nashville in the late 1990s. According to a 2005 interview with Billboard, Keith had the album How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?! completed, but label executives rejected the entire album except for two songs: [...] "Getcha Some" [...] and [...] "If a Man Answers", both of which were put on his 1999 Greatest Hits album. After he recorded two more songs which were also rejected, he asked to terminate his contract with Mercury, and purchased the rights to the rest of the album. Upon the album's release in late 1999, both the album and its lead single, [...] "When Love Fades", were performing poorly on the charts; as a result, Keith asked that [...] "When Love Fades" [...] be withdrawn as a single in favor of [...] "How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?!" [...] Keith stated that DreamWorks executives were [...] "scared to put it out", but within five days of Keith's request, [...] "When Love Fades" [...] was withdrawn and [...] "How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?!" [...] was released.|$|E

500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much about being in love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E

500|$|Keith {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song on his website in 2000. [...] "Initially, I said, 'Here's my title: [...] "You Never Loved Me Before, So How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?'" [...] It's one of my catch-phrases. A lot of people become successful after they've been told they won't ever be, so people can relate to this. It can be about an old flame or a boss or a teacher -whatever it means to each individual. It was a fun song to write." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Do You..." [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said the song [...] "spins the ostensibly sleazy pickup line 'Do you like drugs?' into an irresistibly sweet proposal, imagining lovely, perfectly wasted afternoons {{spent in a}} content daze." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly called it a [...] "fabulous song" [...] and felt that [...] "Miguel's smooth, subtle swagger is so appealing that a line like 'I wanna <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> drugs tonight' comes off as audacious instead of offensive." [...] Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone quipped, [...] "Just when you thought there were no new ways to say 'I love you'".|$|E
500|$|I just wanna be {{the girl}} you like, girl you like". The closing {{minute of the}} song {{features}} a French spoken word interpolation, which translates roughly as: [...] "Do you like sex? Sex. I mean, the physical activity. Coitus. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it? You're not interested in sex? Men think that feminists hate sex, but it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love". David Haglund and Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine noted undeniable similarities between this spoken section and a similar quote by actress Julianne Moore in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. In May 2014, during an interview with Vanity Fair, Lewinsky addressed the lyrics of the song mentioning her, saying, [...] "Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we're verbing, I think you meant 'Bill Clinton'd all on my gown'".|$|E
500|$|His next album, {{entitled}} M-1015 (1984), {{was more}} frenetic and pumping than his previous releases, having embraced the recently developed genre of Hi-NRG, {{but it also}} included elements of electro and rap. The major figures behind the album had been Kessie and Morey Goldstein, and Sylvester himself had not written any of the tracks. The album also contained increasingly sexually explicit lyrics, in particular in the songs [...] "How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Your Love" [...] and [...] "Sex". That year, he also entered into a relationship with an architect named Rick Cramner, and together they {{moved into a new}} apartment in the hills, where Sylvester decorated his powder room with posters and memorabilia of Divine, the drag queen, actor and singer whom he had briefly known when they were in The Cockettes. In 1985, he fulfilled a lifelong ambition by working with the singer Aretha Franklin; he and Jeanie had been invited to provide backing vocals on Franklin's album Who's Zoomin' Who?.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that, you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern release point is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in." [...] In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.|$|E
