Off the ladies cabin above the covered paddlewheel a bridal chamber was built, which contained, among other luxuries, a double brass bed and a silk eiderdown worth $150.

The movement opened the way toward new possibilities, a modern geometrical vision that could be adapted to architecture, interior design, graphic arts, fashion and industrial design; the basis of Art Deco.|$|E

In Europe, Japan, and other markets where it is not available, the Lexus GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup. In the United States, the Lexus ES has been the best-selling Lexus sedan for over fifteen years.|$|E

25|$|To {{close the}} price {{gap between the}} Taurus and the Ford Contour, {{as well as to}} {{increase}} sales, an entry-level G model was added midway into the 1996 model year, as essentially a slightly de-contented GL. For the 1998 model year, the models of Taurus were completely changed. The G and GL were dropped, and the LX became the entry-level/value model. The SE model from 1995 was revived, and it became the top-tier model. The SE was offered with two special packages; the Comfort package which added chrome wheels carried over from the LX, automatic climate control, the Duratec engine V6 (see below), and bucket seats with a center console and a floor-mounted shifter, or the Sport package, which contained all of the features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> package, but substituted the chrome wheels for 5-spoke alloy wheels.|$|E

Ingenhuett secured the architectural services of Giles for the 1883 Ingenhuett Store. The store was operated until 2006, when it was destroyed by fire.
