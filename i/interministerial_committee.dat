2500|$|Acting U.S. Ambassador William Trueheart warned [...] {{that without}} {{meaningful}} concessions, the US would publicly repudiate his regime. Diệm said {{that such a}} move would scupper the negotiations. After a delay of one day due to the need of the frail eighty-year-old Thích Tịnh Khiết to rest from the long journey south; Diệm's committee met with the Buddhists on 14 June. Buddhists pushed for revocation of the stipulation that only local officials could authorise flag displays. Pagodas had been regarded as communal property of the hamlets for centuries and the Buddhists insisted that they be put under religious administration. The Buddhists lobbied for Diệm to immediately amend Decree Number 10 by Presidential Decree as allowed in the constitution, rather than wait for the National Assembly to do so. The National Assembly had announced a committee would be established on 12 June to deal with the issue. Trueheart recommended that the <b>Interministerial</b> <b>Committee</b> accept the Buddhist's position in a [...] "spirit of amity" [...] and then clarify the details at a later point.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{questions}} the common assertion that only exceptional political leaders can implement their aims, {{such are the}} institutional constraints on their action. This assertion is examined in relation to DATAR, the regional development agency of France, where the self- confident and compartmentalised bureaucracy {{would be expected to}} provide leaders with a difficult challenge. The analytical framework is derived from Blondel's Political Leadership, one of the few texts to assume that a full spectrum of leadership potential exists. The thesis starts by showing that political leaders could shape bureaucratic organisations to their own needs. Ministers interested in regional policy adapted its structures from a weak ministerial division to a model inter-ministerial agency, DATAR, whose reputational power was substantially affected by the political leadership's support for the policy. Political leaders were able to recruit DATAR's top staff {{on the basis of the}} criteria they chose; and to make DATAR's size, budget and work activities respond to their own policy aims. Through DATAR they could create, modify and direct <b>interministerial</b> <b>committees</b> and budgets to fit their particular objectives. The thesis then assesses the leadership's impact on policy instruments in two contrasted domains to judge how much leaders are helped or hindered by bureaucratic and other institutions, including DATAR. Whether on roads policy or on regionalisation, the political leadership mostly achieved incremental change, either because that was what it sought, or because its ambitions were curtailed by internal conflict and local politicians as much as by bureaucratic opposition. Sometimes leaders failed to make headway, and occasionally they asserted their political will in a dramatic fashion. Overall, the variety and strength of outcomes demonstrate that political leaders have a capacity to make an impact on bureaucratic organisations and to re-orient bureaucratic activities towards their particular political goals that is far greater than even Blondel anticipated...|$|R
40|$|The Israeli government’s {{decision}} to cap gas exports at 40 per cent, or 320 bcm – 13 per cent {{lower than the}} export limit recommended by the <b>interministerial</b> Tzemach <b>committee</b> last year – was naturally met with disappointment by drillers in the Levant basin. However, on second glance, the government’s slide to a more conservative gas policy will not necessarily restrict export options from the giant Leviathan field. Not only will the Israeli government allow the Leviathan partners to swap gas export credits with smaller fields, but investors are hopeful that the gas reserve pie – now estimated at 920 bcm – from which the 40 per cent export slice will be cut will only grow bigger as further exploration gets underway. Nevertheless news of the 40 per cent export cap raised questions over whether Woodside Energy will withdraw from its $ 1. 3 bn deal to take a 30 per cent stake in the Leviathan field. </p...|$|R

40|$|In May 2003, the Minister of State for Mental Health brought {{together}} representatives from Ministry of Health Services (MOHS), Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD), Ministry of Attorney General (MAG) and the Ministry for Public Safety and Solicitor General (MPSSG) {{to address the}} prevalence of people with mental and substance use disorders {{who are involved in}} the justice system. The result was a cross-ministry commitment to develop a report about mentally disordered offenders in the justice system in order to identify the high priority and long-term issues for this population and provide recommendations to address these concerns.  The many challenges associated with mental health, substance use and the justice system are recognized world wide, and a number of reforms are underway in different jurisdictions. Invariably, these reforms reflect a combination of local needs, resources, legislation and a consideration of available evidence. A critical first step in the process of reform is careful review of available information. In British Columbia, the provincial government has formed an <b>interministerial</b> steering <b>committee,</b> with research support provided through the University of British Columbia. The UBC team, in collaboration with other experts in Canada and abroad, collected and analysed information in the following formats: Literature Review: A scholarly review of the international literature. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive review available of the professional literature pertaining to mental disorders, substance use disorders and criminal justice contact.  Survey of Other Jurisdictions: A survey highlighting areas of need and opportunities for reform in jurisdictions across Canada and elsewhere.  BC Data Analysis: A report examining the administrative data for addressing mental illness and substance use in relation to the justice system in BC. These analyses are based on an unprecedented linkage of administrative information concerning corrections and health services for the population. In 1999 / 2000, there were 52, 000 individuals (43, 859 adults and 8, 234 youth) involved with the provincial corrections system. Almost 15, 000 (29 percent) of the total cohort were classified as mentally disordered offenders. The prevalence rate is nearly twice the rate for the general British Columbia population.  ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the results}} of long {{standing}} annexations was liquidation of the whole social stratum which nobility had presented before partitions. The first actions to make the descendants of the former nobility become the Poles took place in 1934. In north-eastern terrains the actions took place later and in a different way. The action of the recapturing of nobility was begun in turczański administrative unit, and it was spread on the eastern province in southern Poland and Wołyń. The noble youth were led to special military units. A periodical tilled ‘Wake up’ was started to distribute to backwaters. The organizing of the circles of nobility, common rooms, cooperatives, agricultural was started as well. The Secretariat of Polish Social Organizations was responsible for the coordination of the actions. On behalf of Polish Social Organizations the action was taken by the Company of the Development of Eastern Lands. But with time the problem became so much momentous that in November 1937, during the special conference organized by Ministry of Military Affairs, representatives of ministries, institutions and army decided to appoint <b>interministerial</b> Nobility’s Affairs <b>Committee.</b> But instead of it on 25 lh February 1938 Nobility’s Affairs Committee was appointed within the Company of the Development of Eastern Lands. The activity of the committee was run in lour sections: scientific, propaganda, economic and financial. The committee was patronizing to the actions of Nobility Union which numbered about six hundred and thirty of circles and fifty thousand of members in 1939.
