As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including <b>eversion</b> of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E

In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when the ankle joint becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, the ankle joint is to remain supported while depressed and elevated with the ipsilateral (same side) hand in order to sustain the stretch for 10–15 seconds. This stretch will increase overall <b>eversion</b> and inversion muscle group length and provide more flexibility to the ankle joint for larger range of motion during activity.|$|E

Though there is diversity in snout and tooth shape, all crocodilian species have essentially the same body morphology. They have solidly built, lizard-like bodies with elongated, flattened snouts and laterally compressed tails. Their limbs are reduced in size; the front feet have five digits with little or no webbing, and the hind feet have four webbed digits and a rudimentary fifth. The skeleton is somewhat typical of tetrapods, although the skull, pelvis and ribs are specialised; in particular, the cartilaginous processes of the ribs allow the thorax to collapse during diving and the structure of the pelvis can accommodate large masses of food, or more air in the lungs. Both sexes have a cloaca, a single chamber and outlet {{at the base of the}} tail into which the intestinal, urinary and genital tracts open. It houses the penis in males and the clitoris in females. The crocodilian penis is permanently erect and relies on cloacal muscles for <b>eversion</b> and elastic ligaments and a tendon for recoil. The testes or ovaries are located near the kidneys.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 To improve amputee {{balance on}} coronally-uneven and {{unpredictable}} terrain, a coronally-clutching ankle (CCA) prosthesis {{was developed and}} tested using amputee participants. In its adapting mode, the CCA device enabled free coronal rotation of the prosthetic foot of up to ± 15 ° from horizontal, and approximately 100 ms after heal strike, would cease further rotation. The CCA was tested on three healthy amputee participants that stood still on, and walked across, an instrumented disturbance device that was capable of producing unpredictable inversions and <b>eversions</b> of 15 °. Participants’ balance during gait over the coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain was evaluated using the range of coronal angular momentum. This metric exhibited no significant pairwise differences between participants’ as prescribed prosthesis and the CCA in its adapting mode, suggesting the CCA did not improve gait balance on coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain. Lateral sway of participant’s center of pressure measured their balance as they stood still on the coronally-uneven terrain. Again, no significant pairwise differences were observed between prosthesis conditions; however, it appeared the CCA in its adapting mode may have slightly improved participant balance, especially in inversion. During walking trials, the CCA in adapting mode was able to match the coronal angle of the foot {{to that of the}} terrain. However, evaluation of the moment about the CCA pivot revealed that its distance {{from the bottom of the}} prosthetic foot prevented the CCA from reducing the disturbance moment produced when amputees stepped on the coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain. Furthermore, when the CCA was adapting to coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain, large oscillations of the disturbed limb’s hip moment were observed, suggesting participants required additional recovery strategies to compensate for the CCA’s adaption. Thus, while the CCA in this study was able to adapt the coronal foot angle to coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain, a clear benefit to gait balance was not observed. A possible benefit to standing balance was observed, but was not statistically significant. Future iterations of the CCA device will incorporate the learnings of this study to improve the balance outcomes of amputees on coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain...|$|R

2500|$|Aitchison's 'holiverse' (2010): this uses a {{combination}} of topological and geometric methods, and is specific to the actual regular homotopy between a standardly embedded 2-sphere, and the embedding with reversed orientation. [...] This provides conceptual understanding for the process, revealed as arising from the concrete structure of the 3-dimensional projective plane and the underlying geometry of the Hopf fibration. Understanding details of these mathematical concepts {{is not required to}} conceptually appreciate the concrete <b>eversion</b> that arises, which in essence only requires understanding a specific embedded circle drawn on a torus in 3-space. George Francis suggested the name [...] "holiverse", derived from the word [...] "holistic", since (after some thought) the complete <b>eversion</b> can be conceptually grasped from beginning to end, without the visual aids provided by animation. In spirit, this is closer to the ideas originally suggested by Shapiro, and in practice provides a concrete proof of <b>eversion</b> not requiring the abstraction underlying Smale's proof. This is partially illustrated in a Povray computer-graphics animation, again easily found by searching YouTube.|$|E

But the degree of the Gauss map for the embeddings f and f in R3 are both equal to 1, and do not have opposite sign as one might incorrectly guess. The degree of the Gauss map of all immersions of S2 in R3 is 1, so there is no obstacle. The term [...] "veridical paradox" [...] applies perhaps more appropriately at this level: until Smale's work, there was no documented attempt to argue for or against the <b>eversion</b> of S2, and later efforts are in hindsight, so there never was a historical paradox associated with sphere <b>eversion,</b> only an appreciation of the subtleties in visualizing it by those confronting the idea for the first time.|$|E

Remarkably, it is possible to smoothly and continuously turn a sphere inside out in this way (with possible self-intersections) without cutting or tearing it or creating any crease.
