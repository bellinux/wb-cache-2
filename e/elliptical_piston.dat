5000|$|The Honda NR (New Racing) was a V-four {{motorcycle}} series {{started by}} Honda in 1979 with the 500cc NR500 Grand Prix racer that used oval pistons. [...] This was followed during the 1980s by a 750cc endurance racer version {{known as the}} NR750. The oval piston concept allowed for eight valves per cylinder which generated more power due to the increased air/fuel mixture throughput and compression. In 1992 Honda produced around 300 street versions of a 750cc model, the NR (often mistakenly {{referred to as the}} NR750), with a 90-degree V angle. Whereas the NR500 had used an oval piston with straight sides, the road going NR750 used an <b>elliptical</b> <b>piston</b> with curved long sides. The bike became the most expensive production bike at the time when it was selling for $50,000 and with the rarity, nowadays they rarely change hands.|$|E
40|$|Variation <b>elliptical</b> <b>piston</b> skirt {{has better}} {{mechanical}} and thermodynamic properties {{and it is}} widely applied in internal combustion engine in recent years. Because of its complex form, its geometrical precision evaluation is a difficult problem. In this paper, quasi-particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed to calculate the minimum zone error and ellipticity of cross-section linear profile, where initial positions and initial velocities of all particles are generated by using quasi-random Halton sequences which sample points have good distribution properties and the particlesâ€™ velocities are modified by constriction factor approach. Then, the design formula and mathematical model of the cross-section linear profile of variation <b>elliptical</b> <b>piston</b> skirt are set up and its objective function calculation approach using QPSO to solve the minimum zone cross-section linear profile error is developed which conforms to the ISO/ 1101 standard. Finally, the experimental results evaluated by QPSO, particle swarm optimization (PSO), improved genetic algorithm (IGA) and the least square method (LSM) confirm {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed QPSO and it improves the linear profile error evaluation accuracy and efficiency. This method can be extended to other complex curve form error evaluation such as cam curve profile...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{models can}} play an {{important}} role in the development and validation of ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation procedures. Successful prediction of inspection results can greatly reduce the time and monetary expense incurred by a completely experimental approach. One type of model, which is necessary in order to make such predictions, is a model for the propagation of the ultrasonic beams which are generated by the transducers used in nondestructive inspections. Two examples of this type of model have been derived in this work. The first predicts the radiation field only on the axis of a focused <b>elliptical</b> <b>piston</b> transducer radiating into an isotropic material and possibly through a bicylindrically curved interface. The solution takes the form of either a simple analytical formula for some cases or a simple numerical integration over a finite interval for other cases. The second example predicts the full off-axis radiation field produced in either an isotropic or anisotropic material and possibly transmitted through a bicylindrically curved interface. The solution takes the form of a series summation over a set of Gauss-Hermite eigenfunctions. Both models are derived from the angular spectrum of plane waves approach and have made use of the paraxial, or Fresnel, approximation. The latter, more general, Gauss-Hermite model is validated by comparison with experimentally mapped ultrasonic beam fields in a range of materials, both isotropic and anisotropic. The model agrees very well with experimental results except for a few cases for which the limits of the Fresnel approximation are reached. The results of two applications of the model, transducer design and the analysis of beam distortions due to nonsmooth interfaces, are discussed and other potential applications are indicated...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustical}} behaviour of an elliptical chamber muffler {{having a}} side inlet and side outlet port is analyzed in this paper, wherein a uniform velocity piston source {{is assumed to}} model the 3 -D acoustic field in the elliptical chamber cavity. Towards this end, we consider the modal expansion of the acoustic pressure field in the elliptical cavity {{in terms of the}} angular and radial Mathieu func-tions, subjected to the rigid wall condition. Then, the Green's function due to the point source lo-cated on the side (curved) surface of the elliptical chamber is obtained. On integrating this function over the <b>elliptical</b> <b>piston</b> area on the curved surface of the elliptical chamber and subsequent divi-sion by the area of the elliptic piston, one obtains the acoustic pressure field due to the piston driven source which is equivalent to considering plane wave propagation in the side ports. Thus, one can obtain the acoustic pressure response functions, i. e., the impedance matrix (Z) parameters due to the sources (ports) located on the side surface, from which one may also obtain a progressive wave rep-resentation in terms of the scattering matrix (S). Finally, the acoustic performance of the muffler is evaluated in terms of the Transmission loss (TL) which is computed in terms of the scattering pa-rameters. The effect of the axial length of the muffler and the angular location of the ports on the TL characteristics is studied in detail. The acoustically long chambers show dominant axial plane wave propagation while the TL spectrum of short chambers indicates the dominance of the trans-versal modes. The 3 -D analytical results are compared with the 3 -D FEM simulations carried on a commercial software and are shown to be in an excellent agreement, thereby validating the analyti-cal procedure suggested in this work...|$|E
