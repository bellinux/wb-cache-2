60|$|Of course Paddy heard him, {{but he said}} nothing, just <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> working.|$|E
6000|$|He shook a fist at Drummer, but Drummer didn't {{appear to}} notice. He <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on,</b> rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{vessel that}} {{picked them up}} was a {{coasting}} schooner bound {{to one of the}} Florida Keys, and she wouldn't put back with them, for she was under some sort of a contract, and <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> straight <b>on</b> her way. When they got down there, they chartered a vessel which brought them up to Fernandina, where they took the steamer for Savannah. They were on the very steamer we passed in the inside passage. If we had only known that! ...|$|R
6000|$|The Duke, who had <b>kept</b> his <b>right</b> hand <b>on</b> his dagger-hilt {{while he}} held Christian's collar with his left, unloosed {{it as he}} spoke, but slowly, and as one who rather suspends than {{abandons}} the execution of some hasty impulse; while Christian, adjusting his cloak with perfect composure, said, [...] "Soh--my cloak being at liberty, we speak on equal terms. I come not to insult your Grace, but to offer you vengeance for the insult you have received." ...|$|R
50|$|Grant's generous {{treatment}} of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him {{popularity in the}} South. Although he <b>kept</b> civil <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> the political agenda, the Republican party {{at the end of}} Grant's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies. His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party, which lost heavily in 1874. Grant's financial policies favored Wall Street, but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with. Revisionist historians {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant's Presidency as a corrupt despot.|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Toad {{pretended not}} to notice how out of sorts Grandfather Frog was but <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> talking.|$|E
60|$|He had a {{pleasant}} sense of talking at last. He <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on.</b> He {{was moved to}} a sweeping generalisation.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Blacksnake <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> {{through the}} old post {{and out the other}} end, for he was sure that that was the way Danny had gone. He <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> along the little path. Now Danny knew that he wouldn't go very far before he found out that he had been fooled, and of course he would come back. So Danny waited only long enough to get his breath and then ran back along the path to where another little path {{branched}} off. For just a minute he paused.|$|E
50|$|When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo {{continued}} the series {{alone on the}} demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He {{continued the}} series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums. Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then. However, Dargaud, the initial publisher of the series, <b>kept</b> the publishing <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud {{to take over the}} rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).|$|R
50|$|Iffendic {{was located}} on the {{crossroad}} of two Roman ways; the North/South way from Corseul to Nantes and the East/West way from Rennes to Carhaix. We can also mention other older traces from the Gallo-Roman period with the menhir of Pierre Longue (Neolithic) near the villages of La Barre and Vau-Savelin.Normans devastated the district during the 10th century and the church changed of place, it {{was not at the}} edge of the Meu river anymore.The church was rebuilt in 1122 by a certain Jacob, at the place where the church is now. In 1189, the church of Iffendic was given to Noirmoutier en Touraine abbey which founded then a priory in the region. After the settlement of the Benedictines, the diocese of Saint-Malo <b>kept</b> sizeable <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> the parish of Iffendic.The parish was divided into 11 sections, in particular to collect taxes: the town centre, Allansac, la Barre, Boutavent, Canlou, Couacurel, Pintillac, Tréez, Tréhieuc, Trévit, and Vaubeuzet. During the Middle Ages, Iffendic had many buildings on its own territory, like castles and manors. The castle of Boutavent (12th century) accommodated the Lords of Montfort when the castle of Montfort had been destroyed. They stayed in Boutavent during nearly two centuries before settling back to their former castle: the one in Montfort. After that, the site seemed to be abandoned but nothing proves that it hasn't been inhabited then.|$|R
50|$|In France, {{traditionally}} {{foot traffic}} had <b>kept</b> <b>right,</b> while carriage traffic kept left. Following the French Revolution, all traffic <b>kept</b> <b>right.</b> Following the Napoleonic Wars, the French imposed RHT on parts of Europe. During the colonial period, RHT {{was introduced by}} the French in New France, French West Africa, the Maghreb, French Indochina, the West Indies, French Guiana and the Réunion, among others.|$|R
60|$|It was no {{time for}} apologies. I <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> my mad way, caught the foot stanchion, and was whipped around in half a circle flat upon Captain West's brass bed.|$|E
60|$|Darting {{into his}} tent, the Russian did not halt in his flight, but <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> {{through the rear}} wall, taking {{advantage}} of the long slit that Jane Clayton had made the night before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't be mad 'cause I {{came in here}} last night. I counted on gettin' away before you waked up; but the bed was so soft that it ain't any wonder I <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> sleepin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite certain? That man has eyes {{all over}} him, and it won't do {{to take any}} chances with him. He must be <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> here in Vancouver all night, and the game will be in our own hands before he gets back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If it hadn't been mercifully brought about, that I was to {{have you}} to speak to,' pursued Rachael, 'times are, when I think my mind would not have <b>kept</b> <b>right.</b> But I get hope and {{strength}} through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved clear?' ...|$|R
50|$|The feet {{can rest}} on the floor, or on a footrest, which can keep them vertical, horizontal, or at an angle in between. They can also dangle if the seat is {{sufficiently}} high. Legs can be <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> {{to the front of}} the body, spread apart, or one crossed over the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothin'," [...] replied Peter Rabbit. But he <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> {{doing it}} just the same. Then suddenly, after one of these looks abroad, he {{crouched}} down very flat and whispered in Johnny Chuck's ear in great excitement.|$|E
6000|$|Sammy Jay <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> screaming. He {{made such}} a noise that Reddy didn't hear {{footsteps}} coming nearer and nearer. Suddenly {{there was a great}} roar right behind him. [...] "Bow, wow, wow! Bow, wow, wow, wow!"-- just like that.|$|E
6000|$|She {{opened the}} door on a kitchen, the {{highlight}} {{of which was a}} table heaped with dishes of dumplings and salt pork. A shirt-sleeved man, all covered with mustache and calm, sat by the table, and he <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> sitting as he inquired: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know what}} to do fust. The b'ar had me foul, and <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> {{at the bottom of the}} tree all the time. With his wounded leg he couldn't come up, and I didn't dare to go down, and there we was--a-lookin' at each other, he a-growlin' and I a-sayin' all kind o' {{unpleasant}} things about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bending {{down towards}} the grave as he spoke, {{he seemed to}} give closer {{attention}} to what he saw there; keeping in his stooping position till his face began to get a purple aspect, for the erudite doctor was of that make of man who has to be <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> side uppermost with care. At length he raised himself, muttering, [...] "Very curious! very curious!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} based on a novel by Houston Branch and Frank Waters. Film rights were bought by Universal in 1941 for a {{reported}} $50,000, even before the novel had been published. It was purchased for the Frank Lloyd production unit, but when Lloyd left the studio, Universal <b>kept</b> <b>rights</b> to the novel. In 1946 the project was re-activated when it was assigned to producer Michael Fessier and Ernest Pagano.|$|R
60|$|No one moved, {{and this}} puzzled Sammy {{so that he}} hardly knew what to do, but he <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> shrieking, just as if Bowser was right close at hand. Still no one moved. Sammy stopped on a tall pine and pretended to be terribly excited.|$|E
60|$|Blacky <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> flying. Somehow he didn't dare stop just then. He was {{too much}} excited by what he had {{discovered}} to think clearly. He had got {{to have time to}} get his wits together. Whoever had laid those eggs was big and strong. He felt sure of that. It must be some one a great deal bigger than himself, and he was of no mind to get into trouble, even for a dinner of fresh eggs. He must first find out whose they were; then he would know better what to do. He felt sure that no one else knew about them, and he knew that they couldn't run away. So he <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> flying until he reached a certain tall pine-tree where he could sit and think without being disturbed.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{must believe}} the signal was seen, for the galley from Ile Royale came over in an astonishingly short time. The woman <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> till {{the light of}} her lantern flashed upon the officer in command and the bayonets of the {{soldiers}} in the boat. Then she sat down and began to cry.|$|E
5000|$|Inside the Gemeine Herrschaften and Toggenburg, {{subjects}} <b>kept</b> their <b>right</b> {{to exercise}} both the Catholic and the Protestant religion.|$|R
50|$|Besides its freight service, {{the company}} {{continued}} passenger service using their gas-electric motorcars from Minneapolis to Antlers Park and Northfield until the 1940s. Until the Great Depression, the MN&S Ry. also used trackage <b>rights</b> <b>on</b> the Chicago Great Western from Northfield to Randolph and Mankato, {{and even after}} discontinuing passenger service <b>kept</b> trackage <b>rights</b> to Randolph for freight purposes. For freight purposes, the Dan Patch's gas-electric locomotives were sold during the bankruptcy process, and all freight trains were hauled by steam until the 1940s. Immediately after World War II though, the MN&S began transitioning to diesel-electric locomotives such as the Baldwin DT-6-6-2000, then to various EMD models.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 Sunrise {{bought the}} Dominican airline Aerolíneas Mas and <b>kept</b> its <b>rights</b> of {{operating}} the route between Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince.|$|R
60|$|In a flash {{they were}} all {{down out of the}} treetops and dancing around old Granny Fox, cooling her off. Of course, Granny Fox <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> running. She was too worried not to. But the Merry Little Breezes kept right beside her, and it was not nearly as hard running now as it had been.|$|E
60|$|Blacky didn't turn to {{come back}} as he had planned. He <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on,</b> just as if he hadn't seen anything, and as he flew he shivered a little. He shivered {{at the thought of}} what might have {{happened}} to him if he had tried to steal those eggs the day before and had been caught doing it.|$|E
60|$|Half {{way across}} the Green Meadows they stopped {{to play with the}} Merry Little Breezes, and because it was very {{pleasant}} there, they played longer than they realized. When at last they started on again, Old Mr. Toad was out of sight. You see all the time he had <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> going, hop, hop, hipperty-hop.|$|E
50|$|After Information Society broke up, Harland <b>kept</b> the <b>rights</b> to {{the name}} of the band and {{released}} an album, Don't Be Afraid, in 1997.|$|R
60|$|So we lugged him {{on to his}} feet, {{gave him}} another prod, which sent him limping off; and on we went on our course, sure that we were at last safe, for we had thrown the bloodhound {{altogether}} off our trail. For {{a mile or so}} we <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> away from our course, for fear that they should keep straight on, and, missing the scent, lead the dog across the trail, and so pick it up again; then we turned and made straight for the road.|$|R
60|$|WE dasn't stop {{again at}} any town {{for days and}} days; <b>kept</b> <b>right</b> along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds {{reckoned}} they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.|$|R
