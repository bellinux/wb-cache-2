25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing {{the total amount of}} base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E

25|$|Precordial {{monitoring}} of the pulmonary artery is the usual monitoring site, as it combines all the blood returning to the body before <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lungs, so it is least likely to miss bubbles from a peripheral source, and is most compatible with the Spencer and K-M scales, as heart sounds are clearly audible. Other sites which have been used include the subclavian vein, carotid artery, femoral vein and inferior vena cava. Protocols for ultrasonic investigation of decompression bubbles are still in development, and may vary between researchers.|$|E
25|$|Due to its remote {{location}} in Nepal {{and the difficulty}} involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Goecha La Pass, located {{right in front of}} the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier.

25|$|SSS {{can make}} {{changes to the}} Handbook {{as long as there}} is a {{proposal}} made and brought to Senate's attention. If the motion passes, <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Principal. If the Principal agrees, the proposed bill would then go to the Superintendent to look at. If the Superintendent agrees with the bill, the bill will then be brought upon the School Board to decide the proposed bill should be passed. If the bill passes, the bill will then be written into effect the next school year, and the affected area will be changed in the Handbook. Newfound SSS has changed some of the policies around school, including the usage of technology, as well as eating in the academic wings. If the motion fails, the proposal will go back to the appropriate committee in which they will make the necessary edits in order to improve the proposal. Most of the time the motion fails is because of the wording, or the proposal is not deemed necessary. In order for such proposal to pass, the motion must have the majority ruling in favor of the proposal.|$|E

25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E

2500|$|He may be {{regarded}} as the founder of English utilitarianism.

2500|$|Secondly, {{there is}} the right to liberty, which protects an individual's freedom to act without {{physical}} restraint (i.e., imprisonment would be inconsistent with liberty unless it is consistent with fundamental justice). [...] However, the right has been extended to include the power to make important personal choices. The court described it as [...] " [...] the core {{of what it means to}} be an autonomous human being blessed with dignity and independence in matters that can be characterized as fundamentally or inherently personal." [...] (R. v. Clay, 2003) [...] That is, the concept extends beyond physical restraint by the government as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> core of the human experience.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, {{you can have a}} separate machine and do that. if you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
2500|$|A final cause Henry {{engaged in}} {{before leaving the}} House of Delegates {{at the end of}} 1790 was over the Funding Act of 1790, by which the federal {{government}} took over the debts of the states, much of which dated from the Revolutionary War.
