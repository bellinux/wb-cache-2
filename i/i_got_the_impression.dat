5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: [...] "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: [...] "He doesn't put up with bullshit.

Lenin's room is very bare; {{it contains a}} big desk, some maps on the walls, two book-cases, and one comfortable chair for visitors in addition {{to two or three}} hard chairs. It is obvious that he has no love of luxury or even comfort. He is very friendly, and apparently simple, entirely without a trace of hauteur. If one met him without knowing who he was, one would not guess that he is possessed of great power or even that he is in any way eminent. I have never met a personage so destitute of self-importance. He looks at his visitors very closely, and screws up one eye, which seems to increase alarmingly the penetrating power of the other. He laughs a great deal; at first his laugh seems merely friendly and jolly, but gradually I came to feel it rather grim. He is dictatorial, calm, incapable of fear, extraordinarily devoid of self-seeking, an embodied theory. The materialist conception of history, one feels, is his life-blood. He resembles a professor in his desire to have the theory understood and in his fury with those who misunderstand or disagree, as also in his love of expounding, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that he despises a great many people and is an intellectual aristocrat.|$|E

2500|$|Former Oakland A's manager Art Howe (Hoffman) {{has spoken}} out {{publicly}} about his disapproval {{of how he}} was portrayed in the film.

In fact, Bradford was used regularly out of the bullpen in early 2002, {{just as he had}} been in 2001, when he logged 75 innings primarily as a late reliever or set-up man for Billy Koch, the A's primary closer. Scott Hatteberg has also stated publicly that Howe was portrayed inaccurately.

Quite soon <b>I</b> also <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that although there had been several musicians and good singers in that region (now we only managed to collect the basic data and memories of them) and very many still had song notebooks, there was no superstition or any narratives of the kind. For example: My father didn't believe. He did always the opposite. There in a village, it was that: "No, today morning it is no use going out, the horse dung between the shafts. " my father still went, just out of stubbornness. But then there were still some who knew both legends of place names (this time very many about Kalevipoeg and Kuradikivi - 'Devilstone') and narratives with a rich religious background. (It is common knowledge that when looking for the oldest and natural born locals, the collector may not notice some really interesting people - just as almost by accident I found a woman born in 1947 whose grandfather had been a musician, mother a singer, who herself told of a treasure-bearer seen by her grandmother, of omens connected with herself, the birth of her son and the death of her mother and of many other things.) It is interesting that quite some of the people who themselves had no other supernatural experiences had still just before the war either seen themselves some heavenly signs or had heard of them from someone close. In most cases the sky had been purple red in the east, but there were more concrete omens as well. The rich bee-traditions of Läänemaa which have been recorded in the EFA cardfiles in the ` 30 s, have by now lost most of its religious background. From the earlier local witches, mostly those who dealt with healing plants or fixed sprained bones were mentioned. The of attitudes towards the sensitives and healers of today in Läänemaa varied from severe criticism to deep respect. This year, perhaps more material than usual was collected that could serve as a basis for the so-called background studies, that is, what people themselves talk of their life, conditions and how they feel about the way the world is, what they consider to be important, not only folkloristic material and remnants or signs of the primeval beginning of the things...|$|R

Then a few years later, when I did the Jazzpar, and they asked me to put together a contrasting project, the first thing I saw when I went to gigs in Copenhagen was a student jam session. There was this girl who just sang a standard beautifully and then sat down—and all these males improvised for about an hour, all taking turns to solo kind of competitively, while she sat there quietly, like in a trance.

It was different in ’61-’62. I don’t doubt that such talk was going on then, but I didn’t join in it. Bob (Steed) and I acknowledged later that we were gay. I don’t know if any others did. I never talked with Dorothy about my sense of myself, my sexuality. In the mid-seventies I wrote a book that was in a way a coming-out story, and I sent a copy to Bob. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that he showed it to Dorothy, but I never knew for sure. She never spoke of it. I definitely did not feel like sending it to her directly — shy, I guess.What led me to feel that Dorothy disliked homosexuality, that she felt an unexamined revulsion from it? I’m not sure. I heard what other people said about her feelings and views. I’m fairly sure I never heard her speak of them herself... The subject, homosexuality, which later became one of such contention, did not exist among us. [...] Nevertheless, she and Day remained life-long friends-Day even made her executor of her will.|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1979 I taped a number of fairy-tales and stories in the northeastern corner of Mansiland {{in the village of}} Sukerya. As I had no {{experience}} whatsoever of transcribing texts at that time, I asked a student of the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute, Klavdia Sainakhova, who was in her homevillage at that time, to transcribe some of the more interesting stories so I could later translate them. I gave the tapes to the Archive, but the story of a strange hand with a bell stayed in my mind. Who was that strange Hand With a Bell who troubled the sister while the brother was hunting? I know that in Mansi stories the hero is often depicted by some characteristic feature or sign that within a cultural group should be enough to indentify him. For example in that same year, 1979, I collected a story, the main characters of which were Lungs - khopsi. I was explained that they are to be taken as a thin person perspiring in the sun. But about the Hand with a bell nobody could or wanted to say anything. While translating <b>the</b> story <b>I</b> <b>got</b> at first <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that it depicts the relationship between two different groups. The sister, who belongs to the mos'- moiety, sits at home and sews good thing of sable, waiting for a suitor. Then comes a man who is symbolized by a hand with a bell and shows that the sister had timed to stop taking care of her brother. But the brother does not want to give up his sister, hides himself and chops off the suitor's hand. This is followed by revenge from the Hand with a bell or his relatives. The chain of actions is started by the brother that broke the unwritten law. In the folklore of {{the nations of the world}} it is common that the plot of a fairy-tale or legend is concentrated around marrying, often taking the hero either to faraway lands or the supernatural world. From these we can feel the world conception of small tribes of exogamously related hunter cultures where in the central position were all kinds of problems connected with taking a wife. Often the destiny of the whole tribe depended upon a successful betrothal. But often the hero looking for a spouse is not a mortal man but some supernatural being. In that case the story is taking place in the mythical creation times and in some way influences the future world order...|$|R
40|$|The genus Praravinia {{was created}} by KORTHALS (in TEMMINCK, Verhand. Nat. Gesch. Ned. Overz. Bezitt., Bot., p. 189, tab. 41, 1839 - 1842) for a plant which he had {{collected}} in the south-eastern part of Borneo. He described it as similar in habit and doubtless nearly related to Urophyllum WALL. His diagnosis of the genus, however, does not substantiate this point of view, for it contains two statements which seem to exclude {{the possibility of a}} near affinity: the aestivation of the corolla lobes is described as imbricate, whereas in Urophyllum and its allies it is always valvate, and the number of corolla lobes is said to be half as large as that of the stamens, a condition unknown not only in Urophyllum but in the whole family. As in the description of the species the aestivation is correctly set down as valvate, the first statement need not trouble us: the word “imbricate” in the generic diagnosis is obviously a slip of the pen. The other statement, however, is repeated in the description of the species, but it strikes one as anomalous that immediately afterwards the 8 — 12 stamens are said to alternate with the corolla lobes, as this of course would be impossible when the latter were but half as numerous as the first. The discrepancy between the number of the corolla lobes and of the stamens led MIQUEL in his “Flora Indiae Batavae II, p. 225 (1857) ” to consider Praravinia as a quite singular genus, rather out of place in the family Rubiaceae: it reminded him, he says, of the Samydeae (Flacourtiaceae). When he wrote this, he knew the genus merely from the description given by KORTHALS, but afterwards he found an opportunity to study the latter’s material. In his “De quibusdam Rubiaceis, Apocyneis et Asclepiadeis” (Ann. Mus. Bot. Lugd. -Bat. IV, p. 136, 1869) he proposes, {{as a result of this}} investigation, to exclude the genus from the Rubiaceae, and to raise it to family rank. The new family, for which he introduces the name Metrocladeaceae, should be regarded, however, as nearly related to the Rubiaceae. The description of the genus given by MIQUEL is much more detailed than the original one, but it unfortunately repeats its principal errors: the corolla is described as 4 - to 6 -merous, and its aestivation as imbricate. The male flower dissected by him is preserved in the Utrecht Herbarium; it is a fairly young bud, opened by a longitudinal slit. The corolla lobes had apparently been separated by a slight pressure, but <b>I</b> at once <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that it had been insufficient to effect a complete separation, and that the lobes were still cohering in pairs. I have boiled the flower therefore once more, and by exercising in my turn a slight pressure I succeeded in setting all the lobes free. Since then I have seen mature flowers of this and other species in which the isomery of corolla and androecium was unmistakable. MIQUEL’s speculations on the taxonomic position of the genus were based therefore on a false supposition, and need no further consideration; the analysis carried out below will show that KORTHALS was quite right when he placed Praravinia in the neighbourhood of Urophyllum...|$|R
