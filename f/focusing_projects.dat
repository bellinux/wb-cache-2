40|$|This article {{reflects}} {{upon the}} methodological pessimism that sometimes plagues students of organizations. In particular pessimism seems to strike {{us when we}} try to get to grips with the incessant transformations of organizations [...] transformations that seem to occur at such great speed. Our immediate reaction to Heraclitus' statement that: "You cannot step twice into the same river" is that it has considerable methodological relevance. However, we contend that his metaphor in its orthodox version leads to too narrow a view. An elaboration of the metaphor could perhaps reduce the pessimism regarding organizational studies by promoting a focus on contextual aspects. Moreover, changes and transformations in themselves do not necessarily represent a stumbling block for the researcher. Rather studying crucial projects provides a means for studying the mechanisms at work in the host organization. The resulting approach [...] contextualization in a broad sense [...] relieves researchers of some of their pessimism, maybe even inspires optimism, by raising new questions: not only "what can be said?" (about the organization), but also "in what contexts?" and "about what manifestations in those contexts?" The article concludes with some remarks on the scarcity of the contextualization approach for studying organizations as temporary phenomena.

The importance of language comprehension skills for success in learning chemistry has recently been highlighted by Pyburn et al. (2013). The <b>FOCUS</b> <b>project</b> has involved the construction of a database of student writings (from foundation to Ph. D. level) to create a corpus that can then be analysed for the occurrence of key words in context. Using the principles of concordance and data-driven learning (where student becomes language researcher) a number of teaching activities have been developed to enhance the understanding of subject-specific language for both home and international students studying on a foundation level Chemistry course...|$|R

40|$|Interesting {{succeeding}} {{generations of}} students in specialized topics such as the Shroud of Turin requires active initiatives. An important pedagogical objective is served by introducing students to research at the undergraduate level.

The {{purpose of the present}} work is to develop a set of research projects and materials suitable for undergraduate research. The projects presented here all involve computer science, specifically the application of image processing methods to digital images of the Shroud of Turin.
