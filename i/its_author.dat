5|$|However most, if not all, {{characteristics}} of the current centralized state of the Kingdom of the Netherlands were foreshadowed by {{the accomplishments of the}} Batavian Republic, not least the liberal 1848 Constitution.

5|$|In 1983, Evgeny Nikolaev's book Predavshie Gippokrata (Betrayers of Hippocrates), when {{translated}} from Russian into German {{under the title}} Gehirnwäsche in Moskau (Brainwashing in Moscow), first came out in München and told about psychiatric detention of <b>its</b> <b>author</b> for political reasons.

5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for <b>its</b> <b>author.</b> The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with <b>its</b> <b>author,</b> this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the hairiness is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white tomentose, and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led <b>its</b> <b>author</b> to maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as <b>its</b> <b>author</b> were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

The book and <b>its</b> <b>author</b> were also the subject of one episode in a documentary series produced by journalist and political scientist Stelian Tănase, dealing {{with the history of}} Bucharest; titled București, strict secret ("Bucharest, Top Secret"), it was aired by Realitatea TV in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Larsen's {{exploration}} of race was informed {{by her own}} mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and {{is the subject of}} considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing <b>its</b> <b>author</b> at the forefront of several literary canons.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused <b>its</b> <b>author</b> such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith is a 1945 book by Fawn McKay Brodie, {{the first}} {{important}} non-hagiographic biography of Joseph Smith, {{the founder of}} Latter Day Saint movement. The book has not gone out of print, and 60 years after its first publication, its publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, continues to sell about a thousand copies annually. A revised edition appeared in 1971, and on the 50th anniversary of its first publication, Utah State University issued a volume of retrospective essays about the book, <b>its</b> <b>author,</b> and her methods.|$|E
5|$|Politics and Prose (sometimes stylized as Politics & Prose or {{abbreviated}} as P) is {{an independent}} bookstore located in Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C., on Connecticut Avenue. The store was founded in 1984 by co-owners Carla Cohen and Barbara Meade, who expanded the store fivefold to its current size. After a failed sale attempt in 2005, the two co-owners eventually sold the store to current owners Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine in 2011. Politics and Prose {{is known for its}} knowledgeable staff and is seen as a part of DC culture. <b>Its</b> <b>author</b> events attract a number of famous speakers, such as Bill Clinton and J.K.

5|$|The Historia Brittonum {{says that}} Pybba had 12 sons, {{including}} Penda, but that Penda and Eowa of Mercia were those best known to <b>its</b> <b>author.</b> (Many of these 12 sons of Pybba {{may in fact}} merely represent later attempts to claim descent from him.) Besides Eowa, the pedigrees also give Penda a brother named Coenwalh from whom two later kings were said to descend, although this may instead represent his brother-in-law Cenwalh of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|The Ormulum or Orrmulum is a twelfth-century work {{of biblical}} exegesis, {{written by a}} monk named Orm (or Ormin) and {{consisting}} of just under 19,000 lines of early Middle English verse. Because of the unique phonetic orthography adopted by <b>its</b> <b>author,</b> the work preserves many details of English pronunciation existing {{at a time when}} the language was in flux after the Norman conquest of England. Consequently, it is invaluable to philologists and historical linguists in tracing the development of the language.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} a {{commercial}} failure in Japan {{but has been}} successful in the United States. Critical consensus is that Zombiepowder. was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers, which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that Zombiepowder. is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of <b>its</b> <b>author,</b> and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action.|$|E

A characterization of the design tradeoffs involved in building an <b>ITS</b> <b>authoring</b> system is given.
