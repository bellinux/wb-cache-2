40|$|A novel, on-line {{derivatization}} {{technique has}} been developed which enables generation of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles from microorganisms by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{without the need for}} laborious and time-consuming sample preparation. Microgram amounts of bacterial cells are directly applied to a thin ferromagnetic filament and covered with a single drop of methanolic solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide. After air drying, the filament is inserted into a special gas chromatograph inlet equipped with a <b>high-frequency</b> <b>coil,</b> thus enabling rapid inductive heating of the ferromagnetic filament. This so-called Curie-point heating technique is shown to produce patterns of bacterial FAMEs which are qualitatively and quantitatively nearly identical to those obtained from extracts of methylated lipids prepared by conventional sample pretreatment methods. Relatively minor differences involve the loss of hydroxy-substituted fatty acids by the pyrolytic approach as well as strongly enhanced signals of FAMEs derived from mycolic acids. This type of pyrolysis enables on-line derivatization and thermal extraction of volatile derivatives for analysis, whereas the residual components remain on a disposable probe (ferromagnetic wire) of a pyrolytic device. The reduced sample size (micrograms instead of milligrams) and the lack of sample preparation requirements open up the possibility of rapid microbiological identification of single colonies (thus overcoming the need for time-consuming subculturing) as well as analysis of FAME profiles directly from complex environmental samples...|$|E

This paper presents a novel approach to the quantification of vascular tortuosity, using robust metrics based on unit speed parameterizations of three-dimensional (3 D) curvature. The use of approximating polynomial spline-fitting obviates the need for arbitrary filtering of mid-line data which is necessary with other tortuosity indices. The metrics were tested using both two-dimensional and three-dimensional synthesized images that mimicked clinically significant pathologies: two of the three metrics were scale invariant, additive, and produced tortuosity values tailored to be independent of the resolution of the imaging system. Our methodology is designed to explicitly handle the challenge of noisy data, and is largely tolerant of the inaccuracies in the mid-line extraction. While all the proposed metrics are sensitive to gently curved vessels, the rms curvature of the smoothest path was more effective in recognizing abnormalities involving <b>high-frequency</b> <b>coiling</b> such as occurs in malignant tumors. We have also indicated how values from two projection images, such as acquired in biplane angiography, can be combined to give an accurate approximation of the 3 D value of this metric.

30|$|At {{the time}} of Röntgen’s {{discovery}} of X-rays, and for many years thereafter, minimally insulated wires were used for connecting the high-voltage supply to the gas tube that generated X-rays, and all electrical contacts were generally bare. The ability of high-voltage to bridge considerable air gaps through electrical discharge increased the risk of receiving shocks. Gunther [4] wrote in 1919 that all users of these systems received electrical shocks at some time, and although the shocks were painful and could cause burns, {{the impact on the}} victim’s health (and attitude) was minimal. The high-voltage generators of this period primarily consisted of induction coils, static generators and <b>high-frequency</b> <b>coils</b> of low electrical power. Apart from the danger of personal electrical shock, risk of fire existed in places where inflammable, volatile anaesthetics were used. Moreover, corona discharges around exposed high tension were responsible for the formation of noxious nitrogen oxides and ozone. Over time, wiring configurations received considerable attention, but wires and contacts still remained partially unprotected. The potential danger of X-ray machines increased after the development of high-voltage transformers, which allowed for an increase in electrical power. Ensuing fatal and serious non-fatal accidents incited several authors to formulate safety recommendations [4 – 6], which ultimately led to legislation [7, 8]. Though manufacturers developed many modifications to improve electrical safety, it was not until around 1935 that new X-ray systems might be considered electrically safe for the patient and operator (see Grigg [9] for many historical details).|$|R
40|$|Objectives To commemorate {{victims of}} {{electrical}} accidents {{that occurred in}} the first decades of radiology and relate these accidents to the evolution of the X-ray apparatus. Methods Digitised newspapers, scientific journals, books and reports of legal procedures were searched for electrical accidents involving X-ray systems. Information on the his-torical systems was retrieved from the scientific literature and brochures from manufacturers. Results We found 51 fatal and 62 non-fatal but serious elec-trical accidents. Most of them occurred between 1920 and 1940 and involved transformers that provided output currents well above the threshold for the induction of ventricular fibrillation. The accidents led to recommendations and regu-lations to improve safety for operators and patients, and spurred manufacturers to technical developments that culmi-nated in fully electrically shockproof systems by 1935. Conclusions Although largely forgotten, the development of the shockproof X-ray systems we take for granted today lasted about 4 decades and was associated with considerable human suffering. The complete solution of the problem is a success story of engineering realised by contributions from all parties involved. Main messages • The development of electrically shockproof X-ray systems took about 4 decades (1895 – 1935). • Between 1896 and 1920 electrical shocks from X-ray systems were common, but their consequences limited. • After 1920, transformers killed by delivering currents above the ventricular fibrillation threshold. • Inductors, static generators and <b>high-frequency</b> <b>coils</b> were generally low-current systems and safe. • We found 51 fatal and 62 serious non-fatal electrical accidents, most occurring from 1920 to 1940.

With standard <b>high-frequency</b> search <b>coil</b> metal detectors, they can only be tested for metal contaminations before they are wrapped.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{fabricating}} improved transformer cores from composites of thermoplastic matrices and iron-particles has been invented. Relative to commercially available laminated-iron-alloy transformer cores, the cores fabricated by this method weigh less {{and are less}} expensive. Relative to prior polymer-matrix/ iron-particle composite-material transformer cores, the cores fabricated by this method can be made mechanically stronger and more magnetically permeable. In addition, whereas some prior cores have exhibited significant eddy-current losses, the cores fabricated by this method exhibit very small eddy-current losses. The cores made by this method {{can be expected to}} be attractive for use in diverse applications, including high-signal-to-noise transformers, stepping motors, and <b>high-frequency</b> ignition <b>coils.</b> The present method is a product of an experimental study of the relationships among fabrication conditions, final densities of iron particles, and mechanical and electromagnetic properties of fabricated cores. Among the fabrication conditions investigated were molding pressures (83, 104, and 131 MPa), and molding temperatures (250, 300, and 350 C). Each block of core material was made by uniaxial-compression molding, at the applicable pressure/temperature combination, of a mixture of 2 weight percent of LaRC (or equivalent high-temperature soluble thermoplastic adhesive) with 98 weight percent of approximately spherical iron particles having diameters in the micron range. Each molded block was cut into square cross-section rods that were used as core specimens in mechanical and electromagnetic tests. Some of the core specimens were annealed at 900 C and cooled slowly before testing. For comparison, a low-carbon-steel core was also tested. The results of the tests showed that density, hardness, and rupture strength generally increased with molding pressure and temperature, though the correlation was rather weak. The weakness of the correlation was attributed to the pores in the specimens. The maximum relative permeabilities of cores made without annealing ranged from 30 to 110, while those of cores made with annealing ranged from 900 to 1, 400. However, the greater permeabilities of the annealed specimens were not associated with noticeably greater densities. The major practical result of the investigation was the discovery of an optimum distribution of iron-particle sizes: It was found that eddy-current losses in the molded cores were minimized by using 100 mesh (corresponding to particles with diameters {{less than or equal to}} 100 m) iron particles. The effect of optimization of particle sizes on eddy-current losses is depicted in the figure...|$|R
40|$|The cold-crucible {{induction}} melter (CCIM) design eliminates many {{materials and}} operating constraints inherent in joule-heated melter (JHM) technology, {{which is the}} standard for vitrification of high-activity wastes worldwide. The cold-crucible design is smaller, less expensive, and generates much less waste for ultimate disposal. It should also allow a much more flexible operating envelope, which will be crucial if the heterogeneous wastes at the DOE reprocessing sites are to be vitrified. A joule-heated melter operates by passing current between water-cooled electrodes through a molten pool in a refractory-lined chamber. This design is inherently limited by susceptibility of materials to corrosion and melting. In addition, redox conditions and free metal content have exacerbated materials problems or lead to electrical short-circuiting causing failures in DOE melters. In contrast, the CCIM design is based on inductive coupling of a water-cooled <b>high-frequency</b> electrical <b>coil</b> with the glass, causing eddycurrents that produce heat and mixing. A critical difference is that inductance coupling transfers energy through a nonconductive solid layer of slag coating the metal container inside the coil, whereas the jouleheated design relies on passing current through conductive molten glass {{in direct contact with}} the metal electrodes and ceramic refractories. The frozen slag in the CCIM design protects the containment and eliminates the need for refractory, while the corrosive molten glass can be the limiting factor in the JH melter design. The CCIM design also eliminates the need for electrodes that typically limit operating temperature to below 1200 degrees C. While significant marketing claims have been made by French and Russian technology suppliers and developers, little data is available for engineering and economic evaluation of the technology, and no facilities are available in the US to support testing. A currently funded project at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is providing preliminary data on the CCIM technology using a small laboratory unit at the Khlopin Radium Institute in St. Petersburg Russia with INEEL Sodium Bearing Waste surrogate. The task includes both the baseline borosilicate glass and a new iron-phosphate glass developed at the University of Missouri-Rolla, which may offer significant advantages in compatibility with greater concentrations of highly refractory oxides. This project is integrating two disparate advances to develop a system with strong potential for benefit to the Department of Energy.

40|$|The present thesis, for {{the first}} time ever, carries out {{measurements}} with the Very Low Frequency (VLF) method with an unmanned helicopter. It is a feasibility study to test the applicability of using the VLF method together with an Unmanned Airborne System (UAS). This sensor-platform combination provides fast data acquisition at low cost. Additionally, a UAS is able to carry out surveys over heavily structured or dangerous terrain at low altitudes. This overcomes limitations of ground-based measurements as well as of measurements with manned aircraft. In the geophysical VLF technique, transfer functions relate the vertical magnetic field to the horizontal field components. These transfer functions contain information about lateral resistivity changes of the subsurface. The presented UASVLF measurements are conducted at two sites. As a reference, ground-based VLF and Radiomagnetotellurics (RMT) measurements are carried out additionally to the UAS-VLF measurements. Conception and execution of the measurements is made in cooperation with Mobile Geophysical Technologies (Celle, Germany). The components of the UAS are the unmanned helicopter Scout B 1 - 100 from Aeroscout (Lucerne, Switzerland), the Analogue Digital Unit (ADU) data logger, and the Super <b>High-Frequency</b> induction <b>coil</b> Triple (SHFT) Sensor from metronix. Achieving meaningful results with this novel sensor-platform combination poses several challenges. No information on how to construct a suitable suspension for the devices was available prior to the present study. On the one hand, the suspension has to minimize interferences such as pendulum motions, gyrations, and electromagnetic noise of the helicopter. On the other hand, it must preserve the airworthiness of the helicopter. For this, measurements of the electromagnetic helicopter noise are carried out and influences of sensor rotations on the transfer functions are investigated. It is shown that small rotations have a large impact on the transfer functions. Furthermore, the ADU data logger must have a distance of 2 m and the SHFT sensor a distance of 4 m to the helicopter. With the help of this information, a suitable suspension was constructed by Aeroscout. A processing algorithm for the measured UAS-VLF data is developed. Two methods are presented to determine the transfer functions for available VLF transmiti ters in a certain survey area. The transfer functions determined with a bivariate approach are less disturbed than those determined with a scalar approach. A rotation of the transfer functions is performed {{in order to be able}} to interpret the transfer functions with the 2 D inversion algorithm MARE 2 DEM. In the last step of the processing, the transfer functions are in some cases shifted in order to obtain meaningful inversion models. The first UAS-VLF field campaign took place in Wavre, Switzerland. The site is characterized by strong anthropogenic anomalies enabling a first proof-of-concept study for the UAS-VLF method. The second field campaign took place in Cuxhaven, Germany. This site features a salt- to freshwater transition zone. The transfer functions obtained at the respective sites enable to determine the locations of the anomalies correctly. Furthermore, the transfer functions are used to obtain resistivity models of the subsurface. For this, RMT data provide the background resistivities. This is the first time that resistivity models are determined from UAS-VLF measurements. The inversion models obtained with UAS-VLF data agree well with the ground-based VLF and RMT results. It is shown that forward models explain the measured data well and demonstrate the reliability of the information obtained from UAS-VLF measurements. ...|$|R
