Their 90-minute film (shot on B&W 16mm film) [...] "The Seven Hundred Million" [...] was released as part of the series This Hour has Seven Days, which dedicated every fourth Sunday night to a full-length documentary. The following year, he shot The Mills of the Gods: Vietnam for the CBC series Document; this episode won two Canadian Film Awards, Film of the Year and TV <b>Information</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Merit.In his ten years in Viet Nam, he produced a number of feature documentaries (BBC Panorama). In 1968, Durschmied shot the CBS Special Report Hill 943 in which he followed three soldiers in Alpha Company, 3rd Battalion, 12th Infantry of the 4th Infantry Division as they tried to capture Hill 943 in a bloody battle. In Afghanistan he followed Soviet units for CBS [...] "Afghanistan-Under the Soviet Gun". Hanoi recalled him to Viet Nam in 1977 ("Viet Nam - Bitter Victory", for CBS), and then allowed him to follow the Vietnamese Army during their invasion of Pol Pot's Cambodia, where he reported from a devastated Phnom Penh.

40|$|Internet {{services}} {{can provide a}} wealth of functionality, yet their usage raises privacy, security and integrity concerns for users. This {{is caused by a}} lack of guarantees about what is happening on the server side. As a worst case scenario, the service might be subjected to an insider attack. This dissertation describes the unalterable secure service concept for trustworthy cloud computing. Secure services are a powerful abstraction that enables viewing the cloud as a true extension of local computing resources. Secure services combine the security benefits one gets locally with the manageability and availability of the distributed cloud. Secure services are implemented using secure enclaves. Remote attestation of the server is used to obtain guarantees about the programming of the service. This dissertation addresses concerns related to using secure enclaves such as providing data freshness and distributing identity <b>information.</b> <b>Certificate</b> Transparency is augmented to distribute information about which services exist and what they do. All combined, this creates a platform that allows legacy clients to obtain security guarantees about Internet services...|$|E

40|$|We have {{described}} in another paper {{how to develop}} and use smart certificates by extending X. 509 with several sophisticated features for secure attribute services on the Web. In this paper, we describe an implementation of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with role hierarchies on the Web as one possible application of smart certificates. To support RBAC, we issued smart certificates - which hold the subjects' role information - and configured a Web server to use the role <b>information</b> in the <b>certificate</b> instead of identities for its access control mechanism. Since the subjects' role information is provided integrity, the Web server can trust the role information after authentication and certificate verification by SSL, and uses it for role-based access control. To maintain compatibility with existing technologies, such as SSL, we used a bundled (containing the subject 's identity and role <b>information)</b> smart <b>certificate</b> in the user-pull model...|$|R
