5|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in loam construction has revived {{in the developed}} world. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> {{as a way to}} minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, and to create a comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{name for}} the town was 'Aberbrothock', {{a reference to the}} Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier Brythonic term 'Aber' for 'confluence' or 'river mouth'. The name 'Aberbrothock' can be found in numerous spelling variations. In the earliest manuscripts available, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> as 'Abirbrothoke' (in the letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward I) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriage). In the Declaration of Arbroath, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> as 'Abirbrothoc'. Early maps show a number of variants including Aberbrothock, Aberbrothik, Aberbrothick, and Aberbrothwick.|$|E
5|$|The extreme {{steepness}} {{and depth}} of the Black Canyon formed {{as the result of}} several geologic processes acting together. The Gunnison River is primarily responsible for carving the canyon, though several other geologic events had to occur in order to form the canyon as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> today.|$|E

5|$|A {{generally}} malevolent entity, the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships, {{but it is}} also fond of otters, {{of which}} it consumes a considerable number. In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs as if on solid ground. During the summer months <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> infrequently as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{learns that}} a new life {{insurance}} policy has been taken out in her name, by Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer). Martell had been planning with Horne to burn down Packard's sawmill in order to cheaply purchase the land it occupies. Packard speaks to Horne over the telephone, cooperating with the sawmill arson, but arranging to burn it down with Martell inside. As Packard hangs up, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> that the recently paroled killer Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) has been beside her.|$|E
5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse collar as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{return and}} drive Warwick's forces from Brunswick, but Warwick and Stuart are gone. John {{realizes that the}} Circle of Ossus has returned. Kanyenke {{believes}} that his sister, Nonahkee, could be in danger, too, and the pair leaves for New England. Kanyenke's suspicions prove correct and they confront Warwick again when he attacks Nonahkee's village hoping to extract John's location from her. After the battle it is revealed that John Black and Nonahkee are in love, but are keeping it a secret from Kanyenke until a more peaceful time, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> that Kanyenke is aware of this.|$|E
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> in 2D, {{most of the}} {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D games featuring Mario reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
5|$|Operation Clambake {{was founded}} in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an {{information}} technology manager in Stavanger, Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net.

Operation Clambake is registered in Norway as a non-profit organization.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons lost 34–19 to the Denver Broncos {{two weeks}} later in Super Bowl XXXIII. Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings reached the Super Bowl again until the 2016 NFL season, when the Falcons lost in {{overtime}} to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Although the game long stood as the proudest {{moment in the history}} of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 NFC Championship Game has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> by some sportswriters as one of the most devastating losses in NFL history.|$|E

5|$|The Protocol of Corfu {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> {{as an attempt to}} divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{undergraduate}} gossip sheet {{is entitled}} The Sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people's supposed penchant for sheep. Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having {{a majority of}} Welsh members {{until well into the}} 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9million {{out of a total of}} 58.8million at the time of the 2001 Census).|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
