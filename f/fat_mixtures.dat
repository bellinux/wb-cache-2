A maximum fat content of 30 % in fat:sludge mixtures is recommended to achieve the international sanitation requirements on compost quality and to avoid an excessive thermophilic composting time. Under these conditions a fat content reduction of 85 % was achieved. Biological activity was highly dependent on the moisture content as shown by the respiratory quotient values. Moisture content is a critical control factor because of the hydrophobic nature of fats and should be maintained above 40 % in the composting of fats. Biological indices of the compost obtained after 69 days of process (maturity grade: IV; respiration index: 1. 1 mg O₂ g OM⁻¹ h⁻¹) indicated a high stability and maturity degree of the material.

40|$|The most {{important}} form of fat spoilage is oxidative rancidity, {{produced by the}} action of atmospheric oxygen upon the fat. The effects of oxidation on edible fats include loss of palatability, destruction of contained vitamins (the fat-soluble A, D and E), and bleaching of the natural pigments, which are often of a carotenoid nature. In addition, oxidized fats may exhibit toxic properties. It is therefore evident that the prevention and detection of oxidative rancidity are problems of considerable practical significance. An oil or fat consists of a complex mixture of glycerides, these being combinations of glycerol with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are ordinarily stable in air but may oxidize to some extent under extreme conditions, as, for instance, {{under the influence of the}} peroxides present in oxidizing <b>fat</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Fatty acids react more readily with oxygen as the number of double bonds in the molecule increases. For example, linoleic acid oxidizes more rapidly than oleic acid under the same conditions. Ease of oxidation is governed in some measure by molecular structure; thus oleic acid is less resistant than its geometric isomer, elaidic. The insertion of a hydroxyl group into oleic acid to form ricinolelc acid likewise results in a decrease in susceptibility. It is also probable that the position of a double bond in the chain relative to other unsaturated centres and to the carboxyl group will influence its rate of oxidation. [ [...] . ...|$|E

Low protein and high carbohydrate diets, coupled with food restriction, produce more running in rats. In the present study Occidental High- (HiS) and Low- (LoS) saccharin-consuming rats were used to study vulnerability to ABA and its dependence on diet composition. Three isocaloric diets were used.

Human growth hormone (HGH) must be administered by injections (usually daily), so there is considerable advantage to stimulation of endogenous secretion by amino acid-based nutritional supplementation.

Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the effect of nutritional supplementation on HGH production in elderly women with heart failure. Eight elderly women with heart failure participated in this randomized cross-over study. Plasma HGH concentration was measured before and for 4 h following ingestion of a mixture of protein, carbohydrate, and fat or an AA beverage. HGH concentration was determined with ELISA kits and AA concentrations were analyzed by Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LCMS). Linear mixed models was performed to analyze the effect of time, treatment, and interaction. Plasma arginine and lysine concentrations were significantly higher after consumption of the AA drink compared to the mixture of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Nonetheless, only ingestion of the protein, carbohydrate, and <b>fat</b> <b>mixture</b> (meal replacement) increased HGH concentration.

The stimulatory effect of the protein/carbohydrate/fat mixture was presumably mediated by factors other than increases in free amino acid concentrations. </p...|$|R

It has been found that the use of surfactants E 471 provides systems with high interfacial shear strength on the edge of the oil and air at all analyzed The application of surfactants E 322 provides a system with high interfacial shear strength on the edge of the oil at both high and low temperatures, which allows us to obtain a stable emulsion in the first stage of the restoration of dry fat. Note that in case of properly selected surfactant mixture, while weakening interfacial adsorption layers at the water/oil interface, interfacial shear strength of adsorption layers at the water/air interface increases...|$|R
2500|$|Animal <b>fats</b> {{are complex}} <b>mixtures</b> of {{triglycerides}} (stored energy, see: [...] ), with lesser amounts {{of both the}} phospholipids and cholesterol molecules from which all animal (and human) cell membranes are constructed. Since all animal cells manufacture cholesterol, all animal-based foods contain cholesterol in varying amounts. Major dietary sources of cholesterol include cheese, egg yolks, beef, pork, poultry, fish, and shrimp. Human breast milk also contains significant quantities of cholesterol.|$|R
40|$|The <b>fat</b> of <b>mixture</b> of goat and cow milk, {{extracted}} by di-ethylic ether, was gas chromatographically analysed {{in order}} to propose an analytical procedure suitable to reveal small additions of cow milk to goat milk. The obtained results show evident differences in the percentages of some fatty acids. An attempt to apply the peak area ratios, corresponding to the methyl esters of fatty acids, suggested by the literature for cow milk did not yield good results. Other ratios suitable to reveal even the presence of low percentages (up to 5 %) of cow milk in goat milk were found and proposed in this paper. Such ratios are sensitive and can be defined markers towards cow or goat milk and also towards extraneous fat like lard or colza seeds oil...|$|R
40|$|With {{respect to}} the fact that during {{transesterification}} of oils and <b>fats</b> the <b>mixture</b> of substances are produced, following defined chemical structures of trisaturated triglycerides were synthesised: 1, 2 -dicaprinoyl- 3 -stearoylglycerol, 1, 3 -dicaprinoyl- 2 -stearoylglycerol, 1, 2 -dilauroyl- 3 -stearoylglycerol, 1, 3 -dilauroyl- 2 -stearoylglycerol, 1, 2 -dimyristoyl- 3 -stearoylglycerol, 1, 3 -dimyristoyl- 2 -stearoylglycerol. The model fatty bases were prepared by blending of these triglycerides with low erucic rapeseed oil in the ratio 15 - 35 : 85 - 65 % w/w and were characterised by use of the melting point, solidification point, SFC profile (p-NMR) and yield value. The molecule symmetry effect of the structured triglycerides influences the physical properties of the model fatty bases to the greatest measure. The influence of the growing molecular weight of structured triglycerides has secondary influence...|$|R
40|$|Different {{amounts of}} {{phospholipids}} (0. 00 - 0. 07 %) and water (0. 00 - 0. 70 %) {{were added to}} milk <b>fat.</b> The <b>mixtures</b> were crystallised under isothermal conditions and the crystallisation was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry and pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. The crystallisation behaviour was described with the Avrami and Gompertz model which was fitted by non-linear regression. Variance analysis revealed significant effects, whereas especially the induction time was influenced: higher concentrations of water seemed to decrease the induction time, while higher amount of phospholipids delayed the onset of crystallisation. No interaction effects between phospholipids and water were observed. An attempt to explain the effect of phospholipids on the induction time, based on the molecular interactions between phospho-lipids and triglycerides is proposed. This principle can be applied for sn- 1, 2 diglycerides as well. status: publishe...|$|R
