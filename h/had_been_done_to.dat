5|$|On 9 December 1937, Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXD Horatius of Imperial Airways {{was struck}} by {{lightning}} whilst flying across the Channel from Paris to Croydon. A precautionary landing was made at Lympne where {{it was found that}} minor damage <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> a wing.|$|E
5|$|In Tonga initial reports, {{suggested}} that only vegetation had been impacted. However, {{it was later}} reported that power lines had been knocked down by high winds and the heavy rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa. Power stations in Tongatapu were also forced to close to protect the system. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses. The Tongan Meteorological Service also reported that about $2,000 2009TOP, ($1,000 2009USD) worth of damage <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> property owned by the service.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served {{at the pleasure of}} the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E

5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; {{all of them}} appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were surprised when the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed {{by some to be}} a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E
5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when {{given the opportunity to}} debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought {{parliamentary}} {{approval to}} make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, {{on the edge of}} Sheffield. Terminating at Tinsley placated the Duke of Norfolk, who represented the opposition from Sheffield, {{and a great deal of}} work <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> reduce the opposition from landowners. The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts and {{to make the}} river deeper and wider so that boats of 20 tonnes could reach Tinsley. There were a number of restrictions, intended to protect existing water-powered installations. Lord Frederick Howard's mills at Rotherham, Kilnhurst forge, Thrybergh dam and Sprotborough mills and water engine were specifically mentioned.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of Â£37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
5|$|John Sadler has {{described}} this expedition as 'like {{so many of}} its predecessors, fail to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too {{has described}} the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E
5|$|Although the Robbins Report did {{not receive}} the same {{recognition}} as the Leopold Report, it reached similar conclusions. However, unlike the Leopold Report, the Robbins Report criticized the NPS for its lack of scientific research and made recommendations for sweeping changes {{in the structure of}} the NPS, with a proposal for a strong focus on a science-based approach. In 1972, the far more detailed Cain Report was released; amounting to 207 pages in comparison to the Leopold Report's scant 28, its committee was chaired by Stanley A. Cain, who also worked on the Leopold Report. Although this report made similar recommendations to the one primarily written by Leopold, it stated that little <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> advance the previous report's findings, especially in terms of predator control. As a result of the Cain Report's recommendations, President Richard Nixon signed Executive Order 11643, which restricted the usage of poisons such as strychnine and sodium cyanide for predator control.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s the Australian Army's organisation, {{equipment}} and doctrine {{were similar to}} those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports. While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan, little <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia's eastern seaboard, along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia. The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s, but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations {{due to a lack of}} resources as a result of limited defence expenditures. Nevertheless, the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war, and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service.|$|E
5|$|In state {{legislative}} assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK {{was returned to}} power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, {{as well as for}} the restoration of water bodies and tanks. As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> rejuvenate local water bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{took his}} family {{with him as}} far as Denver, while Hayden tried to keep Cope and Leidy from {{prospecting}} in the same area. Following a tip from geologist Fielding Bradford Meek, Cope also intended to investigate reports of bones Meek had found near Black Buttes Station and the railroad. Cope found the site and some skeletal remains of a dinosaur he dubbed Agathaumas sylvestris. Believing he had {{the full support of}} Hayden and the survey, Cope then traveled to Fort Bridger in June, only to find that the men, wagons, horses, and equipment he expected were not there. Cope cobbled together an outfit at his own expense, consisting of two teamsters, a cook, and a guide, along with three men from Chicago who were interested in studying with him. As it turned out, two of Cope's men were in fact in the employ of Marsh. When the rival paleontologist found out his own men were taking Cope's money, he was furious. While the men tried to assure Marsh they were still his men (one suggested he took the job in order to lead Cope away from good fossils), Marsh's laziness in soliciting firm agreements and payments may have caused them to seek other work. Cope's journey took the expedition through rugged country only Hayden had surveyed, and he discovered dozens of new species. Meanwhile, one of Marsh's men accidentally forwarded some of his material to Cope instead. On receiving the fossils, Cope sent them back to Marsh, but further damage <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> their relationship.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 worker {{dissatisfaction with}} wages and hours {{led to the}} General Strike; in fact the Fife miners struck on 1 May 1926, just before the {{nationwide}} stoppage.

25|$|In May 2009, {{one year}} after the attacks the Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa (Cormsa) said that foreigners {{remained}} under threat of violence and that little <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> address the causes of the attacks.

25|$|However, the {{discovery}} of gold-bearing reef in the Klerksdorp area in 1933 by the Anglo American Corporation encouraged geologists and others with vision to see the northwestern Free State as a potential gold field. Prospecting intensified and the first high values of gold were discovered in 1939. By 1940, sufficient work <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prove the existence of gold {{in the area and}} thirteen mining areas were later demarcated around what would become the town of Welkom.|$|E
