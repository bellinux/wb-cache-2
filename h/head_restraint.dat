25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.|$|E

25|$|In an automobile, the {{headrest}} or <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is {{a device}} {{attached to the}} top of the seat behind the occupant's head. Most headrests are cushioned for comfort, are height adjustable and most commonly finished in the same material as the rest of the seat. The automobile headrest was invented by Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921. U.S. patent #1,471,168 for the headrest was issued to Katz on October 16, 1923.|$|E

25|$|In most {{passenger}} vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, {{the height of}} the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.|$|E
