5|$|A {{number of}} <b>health</b> and medical {{research}} advocates, {{such as the}} Society for Women's <b>Health</b> Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need <b>health</b> care more and access the <b>health</b> care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual <b>health</b> needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive <b>health</b> issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and <b>health</b> of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World <b>Health</b> Organization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Health</b> care in Scotland {{is mainly}} {{provided}} by NHS Scotland, Scotland's public <b>health</b> care system.

In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women.
