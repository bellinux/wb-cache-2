40|$|Dermal {{exposure}} to chemicals is highly relevant {{in relation to}} the use of cosmetic products, both in consumers and in individuals exposed occupationally. Regulatory frameworks exist within the EU to limit the dermal exposure of the general population and workers to chemicals in general, as well as to limit the use of certain substances in cosmetic products. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate and compare toxicological evaluations of dermal exposure performed under current regulatory frameworks. The publicly disseminated hazard information under the respective regulatory frameworks was compiled and compared for the five substances resorcinol, p-phenylenediamine, p-aminophenol, N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether. A low consistency between evaluations was observed in respect to data coverage and cited dose descriptors. No systematic differences over all five substances were identified from the viewpoint of dermal hazard assessment. The critical effect and corresponding systemic effect <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor</b> was identical for two substances, differed somewhat for two other (a factor of 2 - 2. 5). For N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine a critical effect was only identified under REACH. QC 20140310 </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} CT radiation dose, {{the measurement}} of CT dose, and CT image quality. The most commonly used <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor</b> is CT dose index, which represents the dose to a location (e. g., depth) in a scanned volume from a complete series of slices. A weighted average of the CT dose index measured at the center and periphery of dose phantoms provides a convenient single-number estimate of patient dose for a procedure, and this value (or a related indicator that includes the scanned length) is often displayed on the operator’s console. CT image quality, as in most imaging, is {{described in terms of}} contrast, spatial resolution, image noise, and artifacts. A strength of CT is its ability to visualize structures of low contrast in a subject, a task that is limited primarily by noise and is therefore closely associated with radiation dose: The higher the dose contributing to the image, the less apparent is image noise and the easier it is to perceive low-contrast structures. Spatial resolution is ultimately limited by sampling, but both image noise and resolution are strongly affected by the reconstruction filter. As a result, diagnostically acceptable image quality at acceptable doses of radiation requires appropriately designed clinical protocols, including appropriate kilovolt peaks, amperages, slice thicknesses, and reconstruction filters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFuran is a {{possible}} human carcinogen (IARC group 2 B) with widespread occurrence in many types of foods. In this study, a survey of furan contamination in 230 commercially-jarred ready-to-eat infant food products was conducted using headspace sampling in combination with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) with a detection limit of 0. 2 µg kg- 1. The incidence of furan contamination in jarred infant beverages, cereals and fruits was relatively low, with average concentrations below 10 µg kg- 1. Significantly higher concentrations were found in pasta (34. 8 ± 14. 5 µg kg- 1), meals containing meat (28. 2 ± 15. 0 µg kg- 1), and meals containing vegetables (31. 2 ± 17. 3 µg kg- 1). The average exposure of 6 -month old infants to furan {{was estimated to be}} 0. 2 µg per kg bodyweight per day. The margin of exposure calculated using the T 25 <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor</b> would be 2692, which points to {{a possible}} public health risk. In contrast to commercially jarred food products, none of 20 freshly home-prepared baby foods contained furan above the limit of detection. Only after re-heating in closed vessels was furan found to have formed. Furan was especially prevalent in reheated foods containing potatoes, with values ranging between 2. 3 and 29. 2 µg kg- 1. The formation of furan in potato-containing baby foods was increased by addition of ascorbic acid, by longer heating times above 1 h and by temperatures above 50 °C. Research regarding reduction of furan in commercial baby foods should be conducted, with a priority aimed at reducing this heat-induced contaminant without concomitantly increasing the microbiological risk...|$|E
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{an advanced}} imaging modalities. Its powerful ability to assist more precise diagnosis {{cause it to}} be used widely in several countries. The risk of radiation to human health has always become a concern among researchers including Malaysia. This {{is due to the}} fact that the number of CT scanner and CT procedure in Malaysia is increasing more than 15 % from 2009 to 2010. Therefore, it is expected that the number will increase year by year. The aim of this research is to study the variation of radiation <b>dose</b> (<b>dose</b> <b>descriptors)</b> to the patients at the hospitals involved in this research. However, this research is only focus in certain hospitals in northern region of Malaysia. The <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors</b> include weighted CT Dose Index (CTDIw), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose (E). The data had been collected by using questionnaire distributed to the hospitals. The data was analysed by using CT Expo v 1. 4 in order to calculate the <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors.</b> The result showed that there are variation of <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors</b> in all hospitals and the overall result is higher than previous studies. It is hoped that every hospital can implement the guideline recommended by established bodies in order to reduce the radiation dose to the patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationships among cross-sectional diameters, weight and computed tomography (CT) <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors</b> (CTDI and DLP) to identify which is best used as a measure for the establishment of DRLs in CT. Data (gender, weight, cross-sectional diameters, <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors)</b> from 56 adult patients attending for either a CT examination of the abdomen or chest was obtained from two spiral CT units using automatic milliampere modulation. The AP diameter was demonstrated as the main contributing factor influencing the dose in CT (CTDI: r(2) = 0. 269, p-value < or = 0. 001; DLP: r(2) = 0. 260, p-value < or = 0. 001) since it has a greater correlation with radiation dose than body weight and can thus be its substitute in dose-reduction strategies and establishment of DRLs. The advantages of using the AP diameter are that it can easily be measured prior to scanning or retrospectively from previous CT images. However, further studies on the practicality of this approach are recommended...|$|R
40|$|If {{in vitro}} data {{are to be}} used as a basis for hazard characterization, a {{translation}} of an in vitro concentration toward an in vivo dose must be made. In this study we examined the correlation between <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors</b> from the in vitro Whole Embryo Culture (WEC) test and in vivo developmental toxicity tests. We applied the Benchmark Dose (BMD) approach to estimate equipotent in vitro concentrations (Benchmark Concen-trations [BMCs]) and equipotent in vivo doses (BMDs). Using the data generated in an European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods validation study we found that the BMCs were highly reproducible among laboratories. The three endpoints analyzed (head length, crown–rump length, and total morphological score) were strongly correlated. A clear in vitro–in vivo correlation was found between BMCs and BMDs.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{variability of}} volume computed tomographic dose index (CTDIvol) and dose–length product (DLP) data, and propose a {{minimum sample size}} to achieve an expected precision. Methods: CTDIvol and DLP values of 19, 875 consecutive CT acquisitions of abdomen (7268), thorax (3805), lumbar spine (3161), cervical spine (1515) and head (4106) were collected in two centers. Their variabilities were investigated according to sample size (10 to 1000 acquisitions) and patient body weight categories (no weight selection, 67 – 73  kg and 60 – 80  kg). The 95  % confidence interval in percentage of their median (CI 95 /med) value was calculated for increasing sample sizes. We deduced the sample size that set a 95  % CI lower than 10  % of the median (CI 95 /med ≤ 10  %). Results: Sample size ensuring CI 95 /med ≤ 10  %, ranged from 15 to 900 depending on the body region and the <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor</b> considered. In sample sizes recommended by regulatory authorities (i. e. from 10 – 20 patients), mean CTDIvol and DLP of one sample ranged from 0. 50 to 2. 00 times its actual value extracted from 2000 samples. Conclusions: The sampling error in CTDIvol and DLP means is high in dose surveys based on small samples of patients. Sample size should be increased at least tenfold to decrease this variability. Key Points: • Variability of dose descriptors is high regardless of the body region. • Variability of dose descriptors depends on weight selection and the region scanned. • Larger samples would reduce sampling errors of radiation dose data in surveys. • Totally or partially disabling AEC reduces dose variability and increases patient dose. • Median values of dose descriptors depend on the body weight selection.

40|$|This report {{provides}} guidance {{for using the}} dose-descriptor T 25 from animal studies {{as a basis for}} quantitative risk characterisation of non-threshold carcinogens. T 25 is presently used within the European Union for setting specific concentration limits for carcinogens in relation to labelling of preparations (formulations). The T 25 is defined as the chronic dose rate which will give 25 % of the animals tumours at a specific tissue site, after correction for spontaneous incidence, within the standard life-time of that species. The T 25 is converted to the corresponding human <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor,</b> HT 25, by dividing it with the appropriate scaling factor for interspecies dose scaling based on comparative metabolic rates. Subsequently, the human dose (expressed in mg per kg body-weight per day) is calculated from the available exposure data. The corresponding human life-time cancer risk is then obtained by using linear extrapolation by dividing the exposure dose with the coefficient (HT 25 / 0. 25). The results with this new method, which can easily be calculated without computer programmes, are in excellent agreement with results from computer-based extrapolation methods such as the linearised multistage model and the benchmark method using LED 10, even though the present method only takes into consideration one single dose-response point. To overcome possible shortcomings of the present method, the estimated life-time risks are proposed to be accompanied by a commentary statement giving an overall evaluation of data that may have bearing on the carcinogenic risk and that may indicate whether the real human risk is likely to be higher or lower than the calculated life-time risk. By using the present guidance and a harmonized set of criteria and default values, the calculation of life-time cancer risk should be transparent and easy to comprehend...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that the {{computed}} tomography dose index (CTDI 100) which is considered to be the main <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor</b> for CT dosimetry fails to provide a realistic reflection of the dose involved in cone beam CT (CBCT) scans. The main reason for this failure is that CTDI 100 measurements are performed within standard head and body phantoms made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) that are only 150 cm long, which is less than or similar to beam widths used for CBCT scans. Therefore, much of the scatter that would contribute to the dose received by a patient is not recorded. Several practical approaches have been proposed to overcome drawbacks of the CTDI 100. The aim of this project was to investigate the various dose indices based on the approaches proposed. The dose indices studied were: (1) CTDIIEC proposed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and based on measuring CTDI 100 using a reference beam and the application of a correction factor based on free-in-air CTDI measurements, (2) f(0, 150) the cumulative dose measured with a small ionization chamber within the standard PMMA phantoms, (3) f 100 (150) the cumulative dose measured in the standard PMMA phantoms with a 100 mm pencil ionization chamber, (4) f(0,∞) proposed by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG - 111 and similar to f(0, 150), but measured in infinitely long phantoms made of PMMA, polyethylene, and water, (5) f 100 (∞) similar to f 100 (150), but measured in infinitely long phantoms. The project also aimed to facilitate the use of indices defined in long phantoms through the generation of correction factors that could be applied to measurements in standard phantoms. This project was based on the use of the Monte Carlo (MC) technique. MC EGSnrc-based user codes namely BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc were used to simulate the On-Board-Imager (OBI) imaging system mounted on a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator. The MC model was benchmarked against experimental measurements and good agreement shown. PMMA, polyethylene, and water head and body phantoms of various lengths and diameters were simulated including a new polyethylene phantom named ICRU/AAPM phantom made by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and AAPM. A wide range of beam widths with different beam qualities were employed. Four scanning protocols using two acquisition modes (full and half), employed in routine clinical practice, were utilized. In addition, organ doses resulting from three CBCT scans (head, thorax, and pelvis) were evaluated in terms of absorbed dose to organs and tissues using MC simulations on the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 110 adult male and female reference computational phantoms. The suitability of the dose indices for CBCT dosimetry was investigated by taking three factors into consideration: (1) the efficiency of the approach as a <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor</b> to report CTDI∞, which is close to the dose received by body tissues near to the middle of a CBCT scan of a patient, (2) the simplicity of the application of the approach in the clinical environment in terms of availability of the measuring instruments, simplicity of the technique, and the number of the scans required to accomplish a quality assurance (QA) assessment, i. e. the QA time, and (3) the ability of the approach in providing an evaluation of organ doses resulting from CBCT scans. To facilitate the use of long phantoms, the relationship between f(0, 150) and f 100 (150) measurements obtained within the standard PMMA phantoms and those for f(0,∞) obtained within longer phantoms of different compositions were studied. Considering the three factors for the dose indices investigated, all the dose indices were found to be comparable, but each index has advantages and disadvantages. Overall, f(0, 150) was considered to be the most suitable with f 100 (150) providing an alternative for wider beams. Therefore, the dose indices f(0, 150) followed by f 100 (150) are recommended for practical CBCT dosimetry. In addition, a function called Gx(W) 100 was proposed for evaluating the cumulative dose in long phantoms, and correction factors were also provided to avoid the use of long phantoms. The Gx(W) 100 function did not vary significantly with tube potential, but the tube potential did influence the correction factors. The use of the Gx(W) 100 function is recommended for estimation of f(0,∞) values from f 100 (150) measurements taken in the standard PMMA phantoms...|$|E
40|$|The European REACH {{regulation}} places {{responsibility for}} providing safety information, including derived no-effect levels (DNELs), on chemicals and chemical products on 'industry', i. e. manufacturers and importers. We compared long-term inhalation worker-DNELs (wDNELs) presented by industry with the corresponding Swedish occupational exposure limits (OELs), {{and for a}} subset, with wDNELs derived by us. Our wDNELs were derived using toxicological evaluations published by the Swedish Criteria Group and our interpretation of the REACH Guidance. On average, industry's wDNELs {{were the same as}} the Swedish OELs (median of wDNEL-OEL ratios: 0. 98, n = 235). However, the variation was huge, the extremes being up to 450 times higher, and up to 230 times lower than the corresponding OEL. Nearly one-fifth of the wDNELs were = 2 times higher and one-third = 2 times lower than the OEL. No time trend was seen in the wDNEL/OEL ratios, suggesting that older OELs were not systematically higher than the more recent ones. Industry's wDNELs varied widely and were generally higher (median 4. 2 times, up to 435 times higher, down to 13 times lower, n = 23) also compared to our wDNELs. Only five industry wDNELs were equal to or lower than ours. The choices of key studies, <b>dose</b> <b>descriptors,</b> and assessment factors all seemed to contribute to the discrepancies. We conclude that although the REACH guidance is detailed, many choices that will influence the wDNEL lack firm instructions. A major problem is that little advice is given on when and how to depart from default assessment factors. QC 20150626 </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: HPV 4 is {{the most}} {{expensive}} vaccine requiring three appropriately timed doses to provide maximal efficacy against two oncogenic HPV types. The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify the use of HPV 4 vaccine in a safety net health care system in terms of its inefficiencies. METHODS: A retrospective study of HPV 4 dosing from 2006 - 2009, among females 10 - 26 years old who sought care in a safety net health care system was conducted to determine dose usage patterns among those at highest risk for cervical cancer. <b>Dose</b> <b>descriptors</b> abstracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) included timing and number in series as well as characteristics of the person to whom and visit at which the dose was given. Dose inefficiencies were separated into "less than three doses" and "mistimed doses" for analysis. RESULTS: The majority (66 %) of HPV 4 doses administered were insufficient to induce the maximal immune response necessary for HPV infection prevention. Among on-time doses, 58 % were singleton or doublet doses. Mistimed doses accounted for 19 % of all doses administered with late intervals being more common than early intervals among those receiving more than one dose (9 % vs. 4 %, p< 0. 001). Third doses were mistimed twice as often as second doses (10 % vs. 5 %, p< 0. 001). Black women were more likely to have a mistimed second dose and Hispanic women more likely to have a mistimed third dose compared to white women (OR = 1. 70 (95 % CI: 1. 11, 2. 61 and 2. 44 (1. 19, 5. 00), respectively). The HPV 4 -only visit type at which HPV 4 was initiated was the most significant predictor of on-time doublet completion. CONCLUSIONS: In a safety net health care system the large inefficiencies associated with HPV 4 vaccination must be addressed in order to maximize our patient's cervical cancer prevention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ethyl {{carbamate}} (EC) is a multi-site carcinogen {{in experimental}} animals and probably carcinogenic to humans (IARC group 2 A). Traces of EC below health-relevant ranges naturally occur in several fermented foods and beverages, while higher concentrations above 1 mg/l are regularly detected in only certain spirits derived from cyanogenic plants. In Brazil this concerns the sugarcane spirit cachaça and the manioc (cassava) spirit tiquira, which both regularly exceed the national EC limit of 0. 15 mg/l. This study aims to estimate human exposure in Brazil {{and provide a}} quantitative risk assessment. Methods The human dietary intake of EC via alcoholic beverages was estimated based on WHO alcohol consumption data in combination with own surveys and literature data. This data comprises the EC contents of the different beverage groups cachaça, tiquira, other spirits, beer, wine, and unrecorded alcohol (as defined by the WHO; including alcohol which is not captured in routine government statistics nor taxed). The risk assessment was conducted using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach with benchmark doses obtained from dose-response modelling of animal experiments. Lifetime cancer risk was calculated using the T 25 <b>dose</b> <b>descriptor.</b> Results Considering differences between pot-still and column-still cachaça, its average EC content would be 0. 38 mg/l. Tiquira contained a considerably higher average EC content of 2. 34 mg/l. The whole population exposure from all alcoholic beverages was calculated to be around 100 to 200 ng/kg bw/day, with cachaça and unrecorded alcohol as the major contributing factors. The MOE was calculated to range between 400 and 2, 466, with the lifetime cancer risk at approximately 3 cases in 10, 000. An even higher risk may exist for binge-drinkers of cachaça and tiquira with MOEs of up to 80 and 15, respectively. Conclusions According to our risk assessment, EC poses a significant cancer risk for the alcohol-drinking population in Brazil, {{in addition to that}} of alcohol alone. Model calculations show that the implementation of the 0. 15 mg/l limit for cachaça would be beneficial, including an increase of the MOE by a factor between 3 to 6. The implementation of policy measures for tiquira and unrecorded alcohol also appears to be advisable. </p...|$|E
