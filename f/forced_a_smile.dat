60|$|Jill was pale, {{and she was}} {{breathing}} quickly, but she <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{unconscious}} {{irony of}} the question almost <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> to his lips.|$|E
60|$|Edgar {{saw that}} she meant her {{instructions}} to be carried out; but he <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (<b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile).</b> <b>A</b> little. The woods are so black--and queer-looking. I'm {{all right}} now.|$|R
60|$|EILEEN (trying to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile).</b> Oh, I'm so glad--for your sake; but--I'm selfish--it'll be {{so lonely}} here without you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} if courage is needed," [...] Kit replied, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "It looks as if I could no longer meddle with politics." ...|$|R
60|$|Janet looked rather hard at him {{and there}} was some color in her face, but she <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Julia {{felt sick}} and faint--her colour left her cheeks as she <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> and uttered, {{in a low}} voice--"But Antonio--Stanley?" ...|$|E
60|$|The blood came to Laura's skin. Jimmy's keenness was not remarkable, but {{she knew}} his sincerity and she <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{not much}} the matter," [...] Challoner replied, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Still, I do feel a trifle slack, and I've had {{something}} to worry me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something of the kind," [...] said Foster, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "In <b>a</b> sense, of course, that's presumptuous; but then, you see, I'm in your brother's debt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I love you, but I love without hope," [...] said Ralph quickly, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> {{and feeling}} {{that in that}} last {{declaration}} he had expressed more than he intended.|$|R
60|$|Then Foster {{came up the}} stairs, {{very hot}} and breathless, with his jacket torn, and {{stopping}} beside Lawrence, <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} eyes towards him, {{and he saw}} that they were bright again with tears, but she <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> to her lips.|$|E
6000|$|Ruth's eyes sparkled, but she <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Logical {{people make}} me tired. But {{why do you}} imagine I haven't the pluck to pay?" ...|$|E
60|$|Charles, though {{filled with}} rising fury, was sober {{enough to know}} in what danger he stood, and <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> to his face, shook hands {{and went out to}} his carriage--alone.|$|R
6000|$|EILEEN (<b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile).</b> Oh, I'm all right. (Eagerly.) But you, Stephen? How are you? (Excitedly.) Oh, it's {{good to see}} you again! (Her eyes {{continue}} {{fixed on}} his face pleadingly, questioningly.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Brooke {{contrived}} to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "It is," [...] he said, [...] "often {{a little}} difficult to make sure of one's motives, but we can, at least, {{take it for granted}} that the man who robs a train is the nobler rascal." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mordaunt {{shrugged and}} <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Oh, well, {{in a sense}} I suppose your {{attitude}} is correct. There is obviously nothing more to be said." ...|$|E
60|$|Mabel <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> She thought Flora was not {{disturbed}} {{about the}} physical dangers, such as fever and shipwreck. It {{looked as if she}} knew her lover.|$|E
6000|$|Barbara <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Sometimes I am logical; I feel I'm logical now. But I {{have left}} my mother alone rather long {{and you must}} let me go." ...|$|E
60|$|Mabel's cheeks had regained {{a little}} of their ancient bloom {{in the fresh air}} of the morning; but at this unlooked-for address they blanched again, nearly to the pallid hue which grief had {{imprinted}} there. Still, she looked kindly, though seriously, at Pathfinder and even endeavored to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
60|$|EILEEN (faintly. <b>Forcing</b> <b>an</b> {{answering}} <b>smile).</b> Well, you see now I'm all right.|$|R
60|$|Returning his {{revolver}} to its holster, {{he walked}} {{quickly to the}} entrance of the tent. Parting the flaps he stepped out and confronted the men, who were rapidly approaching. Somehow he found within him the necessary bravado to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> to his lips, as he held up his hand to bar their farther progress.|$|R
6000|$|He {{dropped the}} heavy bag of flour he carried and <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Does {{it look as}} if I were ill? I've lost two canoes and their loads." ...|$|E
60|$|Good {{breeding}} and intense feeling caused a profound suspense, until {{the young man}} himself approached the party. Paul endeavoured to be calm, and he even <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> as he addressed his friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{he agreed}} with a {{resigned}} smile. [...] "But you just catch hold of that rail, please, before I let you go." [...] She, too, <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} do," [...] said his friend, shaking his head, and endeavoring to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> which his {{feelings}} suppressed; [...] "it will not do, Richard; we must yield our own inclinations {{to the service}} of our country; nor is this pilot a man who will consent to be led from his purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was engaged}} one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and {{dwelling}} on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, {{instead of being}} again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> she said: ...|$|R
60|$|Mildred had no {{difficulty}} now in <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> for the sweet one she bestowed on the veteran almost tempted him {{to rise and}} fold her in his arms, as a parent would wrap a beloved daughter to his heart. Discretion, however, prevented a betrayal of feelings {{that might have been}} misinterpreted, and he answered in his original vein.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were not}} scared for {{yourself}} and were very cool and quick," [...] Carrie replied and <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Perhaps some people do lose control when they are strongly moved, {{but you are not}} that kind." ...|$|E
60|$|This little compliment, or {{the little}} gentleman's odd way of paying it, or his altered manner--so much kinder than it was, at first--or all three together, <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> from Arabella {{in the midst}} of her tears.|$|E
6000|$|March's {{face had}} sobered {{more and more}} as she {{followed}} one hopeful burst with another, and now it expressed a positive pain. But he <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> and said: [...] "There's a little condition attached. Where did you suppose it was to be published?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Osborn, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> as {{he turned}} to Thorn, [...] "you have youth upon your side. Anyhow, I don't imagine the others have done much better, and it looks as if we might as well go home. When the birds broke back we lost the best chance we'll get. I wonder what spoiled the drive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Frances, you wring my very heart!" [...] Then pausing, to {{struggle}} with his feelings, he endeavored to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> as he added, [...] "But, after all, we may be torturing ourselves with unnecessary fears, and Henry, when I know the circumstances, may {{be nothing more than}} a prisoner of war; in which case, I can liberate him on parole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{continued}} Ned, <b>forcing</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "there {{is nothing}} {{for it but}} to make for the nearest diggings, commence work again, and postpone our travels to a future and more convenient season. We may laugh at it as we please, my dear fellow, but there's no denying {{that we are in}} what the Yankees would call an `oncommon fix.'" ...|$|R
