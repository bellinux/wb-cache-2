40|$|In {{this article}} an energy {{harvesting}} system {{for measuring the}} wind speed starting from 2 m/s (about 2 Bft) is presented, which uses the same source for measuring and supplying power (energy autarkic). The use of the same source for measurement and power supply increases the number of potential applications since needed power is present with the measuring signal. For the case of measuring the wind velocity, one might consider applications in tunnels, tubes, pipelines, air conditioning or for controlling clogging of filters. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is chosen as radio technology, since it provides the possibility to realize a unidirectional communication; requiring only a single telegram (advertising telegram) for sending the measured value. A more complex establishment of communication required by WLAN or 6 LoWPAN could therefore be avoided to significantly reduce the overall energy consumption. Since the advertisement telegram does not make any provision for security or against hacking in general, a security concept is presented which includes encryption and resilience against replay attacks in a unidirectional communication system. To facilitate the presented concepts beyond wind sensors, the system {{is divided into three}} major modules namely the generator-sensor module, the radio module and the <b>energy</b> <b>management</b> <b>module.</b> Whereas the first two might be changed in different applications the <b>energy</b> <b>management</b> <b>module</b> could be reused in many different applications. It supplies and stores the needed energy and switches power on and off in a deterministic way to ensure the radio module can operate correctly. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the energy}} {{performance}} of buildings, {{there is always}} a gap between the designed energy consumption and actual operation that is difficult to mitigate or close. This GAP can be positive or negative; in practice, it is usually negative because actual performance turns out much worse than expected. The cause can be erroneous simulations, poor construction methods or operational practices with devices as well as users not operating as expected. Thus, interventions along any of three fundamental life-cycle directions: design, build, operation can reduce this GAP. Usually the bigger gaps arise from numerous operational issues that deteriorate the performance, well beyond expectations. Recent studies in the field of energy efficient buildings have shown that ICT solutions, user behaviour and energy policy, considered as a whole process within an organization, can {{have a significant impact on}} building energy use. As a result, significant energy savings opportunities can be achieved by influencing the involved stakeholders, to adopt systematic <b>energy</b> <b>management</b> practices. The 4 year EU H 2020 HIT 2 GAP project has identified that the gap can be reduced by optimizing the following: simulation-calibration, disaggregation, forecasting, building performance assessment, <b>energy</b> <b>management,</b> user behaviour, multiple set-point control, fault detection and diagnosis. The HIT 2 GAP project will deliver an open solution with analytic tools and modular services for commercial buildings. The paper describes the <b>Energy</b> <b>Management</b> (EnMS) <b>module,</b> within the HIT 2 GAP platform, which allows to build a systematic approach to <b>Energy</b> <b>Management</b> based on ISO 50001 standard. The ISO 50001 standard specifies detailed requirements for establishing the EnMS and improving the overall building energy performance.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the {{greatest}} challenges of the 21 th century. To counteract increasing temperatures and to decrease the dependency on fossil fuels various projects are currently conducted aiming at the private and all the different industrial sectors. One of them is the EcoTrain project which is an undertaking of a consortium of several project partners lead by Deutsche Bahn. Working closely with DB RegioNetz Verkehrs GmbH, the Erzgebirgsbahn, the TU Dresden, the Fraunhofer IVI as well as the TU Chemnitz, these partners explore and work on new approaches to finding solutions for an energy-efficient mass transit vehicle. The EcoTrain project aims at developing a hybrid railcar for the Erzgebirgsbahn: A standard class 642 rail vehicle is going to be converted to a cutting-edge and innovative hybrid railcar. Later on, this prototype will serve as basis for converting the entire Erzgebirgsbahn railcar fleet. This paper deals with the development of a drive train concept for the EcoTrain. Three different approaches to hybridization are explained in conjunction with their respective advantages and disadvantages. The hybridization concepts are assessed and the drive train concept of the EcoTrain is introduced.

40|$|The European {{standard}} EN 15251 specifies {{design criteria}} for dimensioning of building systems. In detail, it proposes that the adaptive comfort model is used, at first, for dimensioning passive means; but, if {{indoor operative temperature}} {{does not meet the}} chosen long-term adaptive comfort criterion in the “cooling season”, the design would include a mechanical cooling system. In this case, the reference design criteria are provided accordingly the Fanger comfort model. However, there is a discontinuity by switching from the adaptive to the Fanger model, since the best building variant, according to the former, may not coincide with the optimal according to the latter. In this paper, an optimization procedure to support the design of a comfort-optimized net zero energy building is proposed. It uses an optimization engine (GenOpt) for driving a dynamic simulation engine (EnergyPlus) towards those building variants that minimize, at first, two seasonal long-term discomfort indices based on an adaptive model; and if indoor conditions do not meet the adaptive comfort limits or analyst’s expectations, it minimizes two seasonal long-term discomfort indices based on the Fanger model. The calculation of such indices has been introduced in EnergyPlus via the <b>Energy</b> <b>Management</b> System <b>module,</b> by writing computer codes in the EnergyPlus Reference Language. The used long-term discomfort indices proved to provide similar ranking capabilities of building variants, even if they are based on different comfort models, and the proposed procedure meets the two- step procedure suggested by EN 15251 without generating significant discontinuities...|$|R
