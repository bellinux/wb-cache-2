5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>country.</b> They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of socialism <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>country</b> was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a world revolution in order {{to replace it with}} socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E
