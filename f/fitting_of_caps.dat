40|$|Use of high {{temperature}} conductors is being considered by {{more and more}} electric utilities {{as a means to}} increase transmission line capacity. Hence {{there is a need to}} investigate temperature rise of transmission line insulators when the current carried by the line conductor is high. This has raised questions regarding the effect of these increased temperatures on the performance of all components attached to the conductor, including the insulators. This paper presents the results of finite element simulation of transient thermal conduction analysis to determine the temperatures reached at various locations on the conductor attachment hardware, end <b>fittings</b> <b>of</b> <b>cap</b> and pin type ceramic disc insulator assembly by using commercially available software Ansys- 11. Remarkable temperature rise was not observed at porcelain and cement of insulators in spite of the high conductor temperature, suggesting almost no reduction in electrical and mechanical characteristics of insulators for short period of time but for longer period of time and varying environmental conditions there might be development of {{high temperature}} and chances of affects of this high temperatures of conductor on the insulator assembly and end <b>fittings</b> <b>of</b> insulator...|$|R

5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cap</b> was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|R
40|$|Dynactin {{is a large}} {{complex of}} at least nine {{distinct}} proteins that co-complexes with cytoplasmic dynein within cells, where it {{plays a major role}} as a regulator of the motor's function. Owing to its large size and complexity, relatively little is known about dynactin's 3 D structure or the structural basis of its function. Use of single-particle image analysis techniques has enabled us to produce the first 3 D reconstruction of the dynactin complex, to a resolution of 3 nm. The actin-related protein (Arp) backbone of the filament has been clearly visualized. Fitting of models of the Arp backbone showed that it consists of 10 subunits. Additional mass, not part of the Arp backbone, was also seen. A preliminary <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capping</b> protein CapZ structure into our 3 D reconstruction of the dynactin complex suggests that it is optimally placed to perform its proposed function as a stabilizer of the Arp 1 backbone and gives clues as to likely interaction points between the capping protein and Arp subunits. The results provide the first detailed visualization of the dynactin complex and shed light on the mode of interaction between several of its constituent proteins and their possible functions...|$|R
50|$|The Cordeliers cloister has {{a network}} of cellars and {{underground}} tunnels stretching for three kilometres beneath the village of Saint-Emilion. The constant temperature of 12 °C and total darkness they provide ensure perfect conditions for fermenting wines. LES CORDELIERS sparkling wines are produced and stored in these cellars using the traditional ‘champenoise’ method. The grapes are picked by hand using small, open trays and then lightly pressed (yielding 100l of wine per 150 kg of grapes) using pneumatic presses. This is followed by alcoholic fermentation and wine blending, using unique processes for each particular cuvée produced by LES CORDELIERS. The wines are transferred directly into bottles and yeast and sugar are added, prompting a natural fermentation process within the bottle which releases carbon dioxide into the wine to produce the sparkle. Following a period of aging the lees lasting for at least 12 months, the bottles undergo daily riddling to help settle out the yeast deposit ready for disgorging. After this the bottles are topped up with ‘liqueur d’expédition’ (a mixture of the base wine and sugar) in {{a process known as}} dosage, before the final corking and <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> wire <b>caps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, Gibson's {{president}} Ted McCarty {{stated that}} the Gibson Guitar Corporation approached Les Paul {{for the right to}} imprint the musician's name on the headstock with the intention of increasing sales; in 1951, Gibson presented Paul a nearly finished instrument for approval. Subsequently, McCarty claimed that design discussions with Les Paul were limited to the tailpiece and the <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> a maple <b>cap</b> over the mahogany body for increased density and sustain, which Les Paul had requested reversed. However, this reversal would have caused the guitar to become too heavy, and Paul's request was refused. Paul states that the original Custom should have had the maple cap and the Goldtop was to be all mahogany. The Custom did not appear on the market for another two years following the introduction of the Goldtop; it is possible that Gibson had planned a full model range of guitars (with a roll-out {{over the course of several}} years) at the time when initial specifications were being set. Les Paul's contributions to the guitar line bearing his name were more than cosmetic, but certainly included them. For example, Paul specified that the guitar be offered in a gold finish, not only for flashiness, but to emphasize the high quality of the Gibson Les Paul instrument. The later-issue Les Paul models included flame maple (tiger stripe) and [...] "quilted" [...] maple tops, again in contrast to the competing Fender line's range of car-like custom color finishes.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} prognostic factors for the persistence of chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in children. Materials and Methods: For this systematic review, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched up to June 2008 for prospective follow-up studies <b>of</b> pediatric <b>CAP</b> as defined by the criteria of Apley, von Baeyer, or the Rome Committee. The outcome measure of interest was persistence <b>of</b> <b>CAP.</b> Persistent CAP was considered only when the abdominal pain <b>of</b> children with <b>CAP</b> persisted during follow-up at the same level of frequency and severity. For each study the risk for bias was assessed. The evidence for prognostic factors was summarized according to a best-evidence synthesis. Results: Eight studies, which examined 17 prognostic factors, were included. Moderate evidence was found that having a parent with gastrointestinal symptoms predicts the persistence <b>of</b> <b>CAP.</b> Strong evidence was found for no association between female sex and the duration <b>of</b> <b>CAP,</b> and moderate evidence that the severity of abdominal pain does not predict persistence <b>of</b> <b>CAP.</b> There is conflicting evidence as to whether psychological factors prevent, or have no relation to, persistence <b>of</b> <b>CAP.</b> Conclusions: Because there are few prognostic follow-up studies on pediatric CAP, the evidence for prognostic factors is limited. Physicians should ask about parental gastrointestinal problems because this is a risk factor for persistence <b>of</b> <b>CAP</b> in children. The hypothesis that psychological factors of the child predict persistence <b>of</b> <b>CAP</b> is not supported by evidence from follow-up studies...|$|R
