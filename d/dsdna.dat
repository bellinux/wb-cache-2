5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (<b>dsDNA)</b> structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or <b>dsDNA</b> (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E

40|$|Department of Biomedical EngineeringThe {{methylation}} of CpG {{sites on}} genome {{has been known}} to {{play a crucial role in}} epigenetic gene regulation. We hypothesize that the C 5 methyl group modulates the attractive interaction between double stranded DNAs in the presence of biogenic polyamines like spermine and poly-lysine. We designed a set of experiments with sequence-controlled and chemically modified DNAs to test the hypothesis. We made <b>dsDNAs</b> that have TA-rich, CG-rich, CpG-methylated (mCG) - rich, or UA-rich sequence and measured their propensity to form aggregates by precipitation and ensemble FRET measurements. In the presence of spermine, TA-rich or mCG-rich <b>dsDNAs,</b> both having the C 5 methyl group on T or mC, exhibited significantly stronger affinity than CG-rich or UA-rich ones that do not contain the methyl group. Similar trend was observed in the presence of hexa-lysine, which models the lysine-rich histone tails. These results suggest the critical role of the additional methyl group in determining the attractive potential between <b>dsDNAs.</b> From multi-color single molecule FRET measurements on vesicle-encapsulated pairs of <b>dsDNAs,</b> we found that the DNA binding dynamics is temporally anti-correlated with the DNA bending dynamics, consistent with the methylation-dependent DNA looping previously observed. From all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we propose the physical mechanism for the methylation-dependent attraction based on the steric repulsion of polyamines by the C 5 methyl group. Our findings suggest plausible explanations for the physical origin of the chromosome arrangement and its epigenetic modulation. clos...|$|R

During a series of preliminary experiments aimingat optimizing the electroporation procedure of C. guilliermondii cells, we observed that the efficiencyof transformation of an ura 5 recipient strain with the corresponding dominant marker URA 5 was morethan a thousand fold higher {{as compared with the}} transformation of an ura 3 strain with the URA 3 wildtype allele. This result allowed the identification of an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) withinan A/T rich region located upstream of the URA 5 open reading frame (ORF). Interestingly, linear doublestrand DNAs (<b>dsDNAs)</b> containing this putative ARS are circularized and then autonomously replicatedin C. guilliermondii transformed cells.

Assays were performed under several culture conditions, showing that all the analyzed X. dendrorhous and P. rhodozyma strains have killing activity against Kloeckera apiculata, Rhodotorula sloffiae, and R. minuta. This activity was greater in rich media at a pH from 4. 6 to 5. 0. Extracellular protein extracts with fungicidal activity were obtained from cultures of all strains, and their characterization suggested that a protein of 33 kDa is the antifungal factor. According to peptide mass fingerprinting and an analysis of the results with the MASCOT search engine, this protein was identified as an aspartic protease. Additionally, extrachromosomal double-stranded DNA elements (<b>dsDNAs)</b> were observed in all X. dendrorhous and P. rhodozyma strains. Although there is a high variability, two <b>dsDNAs</b> of 5. 4 and 6. 8 kb are present in all strains.

This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of ssDNA from denatured <b>dsDNA.</b> EIA detects low and high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.|$|E

30|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have been}} one of the most promising nanoscale materials for various applications due to their unique electrical, mechanical, thermal, and optical properties [1, 2]. Nevertheless, bundling of CNTs, due to their strong hydrophobicity, is an obstacle for many applications. For biological applications of CNTs, making stable aqueous suspension of individual CNTs by functionalizing their surface with appropriate biomolecules is essential [3, 4]. Single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) or double-stranded DNAs (<b>dsDNAs)</b> have been most commonly used for such functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and optical properties of DNA-functionalized SWCNTs have been intensively studied [5 – 7].|$|R
40|$|DNA {{computing}} {{often makes}} use of hybridization, whether for vastly generating the initial candidate answers or amplification by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The main idea behind DNA computing approaches for solving weighted graph problems {{is that if the}} degree of hybridization can be controlled, then it is able to generate more double stranded DNAs (<b>dsDNAs),</b> which represent the answer of the problem during in vitro computation. Previously, length, concentration, and melting temperature, have been exploited for encoding of weights of a weighted graph problem. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach, which is called concentration-controlled direct-proportional length-based DNA computing (CCDPLB-DNAC), that combines two characteristics: length and concentration, for encoding and at the same time, effectively control the degree of hybridization of DNA. The encoding by length is realized whereby the cost of each path is encoded by the length of the oligonucleotides (oligos) in a proportional way. On the other hand, the hybridization control by concentration is done by varying the amount of oligos, as the input of computation, before the computation begins. The advantage is such that, after an initial pool generation and amplification, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) can be performed to separate the survived <b>dsDNAs</b> according to their length, which directly decodes the results. The proposed approach shows significant improvement in term of materials used and scalability. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed CCDPLB-DNAC for solving weighted graph problems, such as the shortest path problem...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} of the generation of <b>dsDNA</b> antibodies is still unknown, {{it is likely that}} extracellular DNA is one cause of an immune response against <b>dsDNA.</b> There {{is a great deal of}} evidence supporting the idea that dead or dying cells are one major source of this extracellular DNA. Apoptosis is the highly organised process of programmed cell death in which the cell degrades the nuclear DNA and signals for phagocytosis. In people with SLE and other autoimmune disorders this process is thought to be defective, causing either an increase in cell death and/or a decrease in the rate of dead cell clearance.|$|E
25|$|Nucleosomes are {{portions}} of double-stranded DNA (<b>dsDNA)</b> that are wrapped around protein complexes called histone cores. These histone cores {{are composed of}} 8 subunits, two each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. This protein complex forms a cylindrical shape that <b>dsDNA</b> wraps around with approximately 147 base pairs. Nucleosomes are formed as a beginning step for DNA compaction that also contributes to structural support as well as serves functional roles. These functional roles are contributed by the tails of the histone subunits. The histone tails insert themselves in the minor grooves of the DNA and extend through the double helix, which leaves them open for modifications involved in transcriptional activation. Acetylation has been closely associated with increases in transcriptional activation while deacetylation has been linked with transcriptional deactivation. These reactions occur post-translation and are reversible.|$|E

30|$|Through siRNA-based screening, LRRFIP 1 was {{identified}} as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor. LRRFIP 1 knockdown leads to inhibition of type I IFN production upon L. monocytogenes infection (Yang et al., 2010). Moreover, LRRFIP 1 binds non-self nucleic acids such as dsRNAs and <b>dsDNAs.</b> LRRFIP 1 then recruits and activates β-catenin that binds to the C-terminal part of IRF 3. β-catenin also recruits the acetyltransferase p 300 to IRF 3 and promotes the activation of the IFN-β enhanceosome. However, LRRFIP 1 mediated IFN production bypasses STING, a critical player in the DNA-triggered type I interferon pathways. The exact role of LRRFIP 1 in the innate immune responses still needs to be further verified through genetic knockout models.|$|R
30|$|During {{the reverse}} {{transcription}} of HIV viral RNAs, only single-stranded DNA is generated. However, {{based on previous}} knowledge on cGAS, only double-stranded DNA can associate with and activate cGAS (Wu and Chen, 2014). Then how HIV-derived DNA is recognized by cGAS? Actually, HIV-derived single-stranded DNA forms short base-paired DNA stretches that are strong activators of cGAS (Herzner et al., 2015). These short <b>dsDNAs</b> (also called Y-form DNA) formed from single-stranded DNAs are the predominant viral DNAs in the cytosol during the early infection of host cells. Y-form DNAs are characterized by unpaired guanosines flanking the stem region. They are flexible in respect of the numbers of unpaired guanosines and represent a newly discovered robust PAMP.|$|R
3000|$|... cGAS (encoded by MB 21 D 1 gene) {{has been}} {{recently}} defined a well-known DNA sensor that recognizes cytoplasmic DNA (Ablasser et al., 2013 a; Ablasser et al., 2013 b; Gao et al., 2013 a; Li et al., 2013 b; Schoggins et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013). Double stranded DNAs (<b>dsDNAs)</b> longer than 36 bp are optimal for cGAS activation (Gao et al., 2013 b). Once detect DNA, cGAS undergoes a conformational change that allows ATP and GTP {{to come into}} the catalytic pocket, leading to the synthesis of cGAMP, a strong activator of the STING-TBK 1 axis (Civril et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2013 b; Kranzusch et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). cGAS is involved in immune recognition of various DNA viruses, certain retroviruses, and even intracellular bacteria (Collins et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013 b; Wassermann et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2015; Yoh et al., 2015). cGAS can be activated by <b>dsDNAs</b> and DNA-RNA hybrids (Mankan et al., 2014). Besides sensing exogenous pathogenic DNAs, cGAS is also responsible for monitoring self-originated DNA (Rongvaux et al., 2014; White et al., 2014). During HSV infection, mitochondrial integrity is destroyed, causing the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that can be detected by cytosolic cGAS (West et al., 2015). Moreover, in caspase deficient cells, mtDNA is delivered to the cytoplasm, causing cGAS activation during the process of apoptosis (Rongvaux et al., 2014; White et al., 2014). In this review, we will introduce the discovery of cGAS and describe the properties of cGAS as a DNA sensor.|$|R

30|$|DNA/RNA origami, a new {{programmed}} {{nucleic acid}} assembly system, uses {{the nature of}} nucleic acid complementarity (i.e., the specificity of Watson–Crick base pairing) {{for the construction of}} nanostructures by means of the intermolecular interactions of DNA/RNA strands. 2 D and 3 D DNA/RNA nanostructures {{with a wide variety of}} shapes and defined sizes have been created with precise control over their geometries, periodicities and topologies [16, 128, 129]. Rothemund developed a versatile and simple ‘one-pot’ 2 D DNA origami method named ‘scaffolded DNA origami,’ which involves the folding of a long single strand of viral DNA into a DNA scaffold of a desired shape, such as a square, rectangle, triangle, five-pointed star, and even a smiley face using multiple short ‘staple’ strands [130]. To fabricate and stabilize various shapes of DNA tiles, crossover motifs have been designed through the reciprocal exchange of DNA backbones. Branched DNA tiles have also been constructed using sticky ends and crossover junction motifs, such as tensegrity triangles (rigid structures in a periodic-array form) and algorithmic self-assembled Sierpinski triangles (a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle). These DNA tiles can further self-assemble into NTs, helix bundles and complex DNA motifs and arrays [17]. 3 D DNA origami structures can be designed by extending the 2 D DNA origami system, e.g., by bundling <b>dsDNAs,</b> where the relative positioning of adjacent <b>dsDNAs</b> is controlled by crossovers or by folding 2 D origami domains into 3 D structures using interconnection strands [131]. 3 D DNA networks with such topologies as cubes, polyhedrons, prisms and buckyballs have also been fabricated using a minimal set of DNA strands based on junction flexibility and edge rigidity [17].|$|R

One endonuclease activity is mito-chondrial (mt). The other endonuclease, called En-donuclease G, is associated with isolated nuclei, and is released when the nuclear chromatin is exposed to moderate ionic strength. Our laboratory has previous-ly purified the mt endonuclease to near homogeneity from mitochondria of bovine heart and reported the enzyme to be a homodimer of a = 29 kDa polypeptide [Cummings, O.

Although the purified mt endonuclease will extensively fragment M 13 viral ssDNA and plasmid <b>dsDNAs</b> in vitro, the enzyme displays an unusually strong preference to nick within a (dG) 12 :(dC) 12 sequence tract which resides just upstream from the origin of DNA replication in the mitochondrial genome.

In the present study, we find that Endonuclease G partially purified from calf thy-mus nuclei will extensively degrade both viral ss- and <b>dsDNAs</b> in vitro, and that the enzyme possesses biochemical properties and specificity jpr nucleotide sequences in DNA that are strongly related or identical to those of the mt endonuclease. These findings and the discovery of sequence identity between the pro-teins strengthen the conclusion that the nuclear Endonuclease G is the same enzyme as the mt endonuclease...|$|R

We show that enzymes from the contacting solution cannot access the <b>dsDNAs</b> from the top-matrix interface, and instead enter at the matrix sides to diffuse two-dimensionally in the gap between top- and bottom-matrix interfaces.

Structural analysis shows that STING does not have the cavity to bind <b>dsDNAs.</b> Interestingly, STING has a high affinity for cyclic dinucleotides such as c-di-GMP or c-di-AMP. Cyclic dinucleotides are important secondary messenger molecules involved in signaling of bacteria. They are secreted into the cytosol of host during the invasion or replication of bacteria by multidrug efflux pumps (Whiteley et al., 2015). c-di-AMP secreted by L. monocytogenes activates the STING-IRF 3 pathway, leading to elevated type I interferon levels that hinder the clearance of intracellular bacteria (Auerbuch et al., 2004; O’Connell et al., 2004). It is curious that STING has such a high affinity for cyclic dinucleotides which seems irrelevant to exogenous DNA recognition.|$|R
