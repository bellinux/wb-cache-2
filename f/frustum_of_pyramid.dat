40|$|Pyramid sharp {{pyrolysis}} flame is a {{new method}} for carbon nanotubes synthesis. Oxy-acetylene flame outside the <b>frustum</b> <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> sharp reactor provides the necessary high temperature circumstance for carbon nanotubes synthesis, while inside the interior mixture of CO, H 2, He, and iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5) is heated. CO is used {{as the source of}} carbon, Fe(CO) 5 as the source of catalyst precursor. Special structure of the <b>frustum</b> <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> sharp reactor makes the oxy-acetylene flame folded gradually above the reactor. And it meets the condition that the interior mixture which has reacted initially under high temperature and will flow out of reactor avoids exposing to air completely and burning abundantly. Immersing a sampling substrate into the incomplete burning flame can gain carbon nanotubes. By adjusting the distance between the oxy-acetylene flame jet and the synthesis area, achieved the purpose that just changing one factor of synthesis or pyrolysis temperature while the other one constant, then respectively studied the effects of them on experimental. The perfect synthesis temperature in experimental is about 595 ℃, while the pyrolysis temperature is about 1000 ℃.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming {{processes}} {{there is still a}} lack of knowledge in the field of environmental sustainability mainly due to the need of a proper modeling of issues and factors to be taken into account. Such topic is, nowadays, a urgent and remarkable issue in manufacturing and the main concerns are related to more efficient use of materials and energy. What is more, the estimation of environmental burdens of forming technologies is very complex to be accomplished since it is essentially process-dependent. This means that when comparing, for instance, a traditional forming process with an innovative one, there are some peculiar aspects to be considered; actually, processes can be rather different each other in terms of tooling, operative parameters and so on. In this paper, a first modeling effort is presented in order to compare, from a sustainability point of view, a classical stamping process with an incremental forming one.

The key elements of the detectors are a beam splitter and a Fabry-perot filter respectively. The beam splitter are micromachined plates with pyramids or V-grooves with a pitch of 100 … 150 µm to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the radiation flux. Narrow bandpass filters are arranged at a filter cage forming a four sided <b>frustum</b> <b>of</b> <b>pyramid.</b> The angle of 30 ° for the micro pyramids and the filter cage guarantees that the radiation hits the filter perpendicular.

Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was used to illustrate the results of experimental. By adjusting the distance between the oxy-acetylene flame jet and the synthesis zone, studied the effects of pyrolysis and synthesis temperature. The preferable pyrolysis temperature in experimental is about 693 °C while the synthesis temperature is about 595 °C, and preferable synthesis temperature is about 535 °C while pyrolysis temperature is about 1000 °C. It can be also concluded that when the synthesis temperature is high (595 °C, comparing with 535 °C), preferable pyrolysis temperature is low (693 °C, comparing with 1000 °C), vice versa.
