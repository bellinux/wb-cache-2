40|$|Current {{work in the}} IETF aims at {{providing}} service differentiation on the Internet. One {{proposal is}} to provide loss differentiation by assigning levels of drop precedence to IP packets. In this paper, we evaluate the active queue management (AQM) mechanisms RED In and Out (RIO) and Weighted RED (WRED) in providing levels of drop precedence under different loads. For low <b>drop</b> precedence <b>traffic,</b> RIO and WRED can be configured to offer sheltering (i. e., low <b>drop</b> precedence <b>traffic</b> is protected from losses caused by higher <b>drop</b> precedence <b>traffic).</b> However, if traffic control fails or is inaccurate, such configurations can cause starvation of <b>traffic</b> at high <b>drop</b> precedence levels. Configuring WRED to instead offer relative differentiation can eliminate the risk of starvation. However, WRED cannot, without reconfiguration, both offer sheltering when low <b>drop</b> precedence <b>traffic</b> is properly controlled and avoid starvation at overload of low <b>drop</b> precedence <b>traffic.</b> To achieve this, we propose a new AQM mechanism, WRED with Thresholds (WRT). The benefit of WRT is that, without reconfiguration, it offers sheltering when low <b>drop</b> precedence <b>traffic</b> is properly controlled and relative differentiation otherwise. We present simulations showing that WRT has these properties. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Probing based {{approaches}} have been effectively used for network monitoring in the past. Probes such as ICMP pings provide an effective tool for detecting compromised nodes which try to delay or <b>drop</b> <b>traffic.</b> But an intelligent attacker may evade detection by giving preferential treatment to probe traffic. This is usually possible because probe packets {{have a different}} format from regular application packets and are easily distinguishable.

In this paper, we build upon our earlier work on the design approaches for stealthy probing, and we propose a lightweight and effective scheme for generating stealthy probes.

To determine whether threats indeed occur, and evaluate the actual nature of the traffic, measurement solutions need to be adapted. By implementing these specific parsing capabilities in flow exporters and performing measurements on two different production networks, we show it is feasible to quantify the metrics directly related to these threats, and thus allow for monitoring and detection. Analysing the traffic that is hidden behind Extension Headers, we find mostly benign traffic that directly affects end-user QoE: simply <b>dropping</b> all <b>traffic</b> containing Extension Headers is thus a bad practice with more consequences than operators might be aware of...|$|R

40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} {{in the past for}} monitoring a network to diagnose failures and performance bottlenecks. One such approach for efficient and effective monitoring is probing. Probes such as ICMP pings are an effective tool for detecting network nodes which have been compromised by an attacker who tries to delay or <b>drop</b> <b>traffic</b> passing through the captured node. However an intelligent attacker may evade detection by giving preferential treatment to probe traffic. This is usually possible because probe packets have a different format from regular application packets and are easily distinguishable.

In this paper, we review design approaches for generating stealthy probes and describe various possible mechanisms {{that can be used for}} such a design. These approaches are evaluated according to the design criteria and we identify what may be feasible solutions for stealthy probing in battlefield ad-hoc wireless networks. 1...|$|E
40|$|Capacity drop {{indicates}} that the queue discharge rate {{is lower than the}} road capacity. Due to the capacity <b>drop,</b> <b>traffic</b> delays increase once queues form. Researchers find that queue discharge rates vary in different traffic conditions. Empirical data shows that the queue discharge rate increases as the speed in congestion increases. Understanding what and how driver behaviors result in such variable queue discharge rates can help minimize traffic delays and eliminate congestion. However, as far as authors know, few efforts have been devoted to testing impacts of traffic behaviors on the variable queue discharge rate. This paper tries to fill in the gap. The authors investigate to what extent acceleration variety and reaction time can influence the queue discharge rate. It is found that the acceleration variety cannot reduce the queue discharge rate considerably. Modelling reaction time might be more important than modeling acceleration when giving capacity drop in car-following models. A multi-phase reaction time mechanism for giving variable queue discharge rates is proposed. That is, decreasing reaction time as the speed in congestion increases can give the same variable queue discharge rate as empirical observations. The research might indicate that motivating drivers to speed up earlier could benefit increasing queue discharge rates and minimizing delays. Transport and Plannin...|$|E

Shields are less disruptive to install and uninstall, easier to test for bad side effects, and hence more reliable than traditional software patches. In this paper, we show that this concept is feasible by describing a prototype Shield framework implementation that filters traffic at the transport layer. We designed a safe and restrictive language to describe vulnerabilities as partial state machines of the vulnerable application. The expressiveness of the language has been verified by encoding the signatures of a number of known vulnerabilites. Our evaluation provides evidence of Shield’s low false positive rate and impact on application throughput. An examination of a sample set of known vulnerabilities suggests that Shield could be used to prevent exploitation of a substantial fraction of the most dangerous ones. I...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Most highway engineers agree that freeway exit lane drops create problems in terms of safety and efficiency. A driver can create a hazardous situation when making a sudden lane change out of or into an exit-only lane. Since left exits already violate driver expectancy, the potential for a hazardous situation is greatly increased if the exit lane drop occurs {{on the left side of}} the freeway. As might be expected, a left exit lane drop is a far more serious problem than either of its individual components; more drivers are affected, interactions in the traffic stream are more turbulent, and the potential for confusion and accidents is substantially greater. Exit-only signs and pavement markings are two methods used to communicate an exit lane drop to motorists. Signs are a required treatment in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices while pavement markings are an optional treatment. Sign treatments include diagrammatic signs, modified diagrammatic signs, the use of the black-on-yellow EXIT ONLY panel on conventional signs, and other signs. Markings include alternative gore area treatments and wider, closely-spaced lane lines. The objective of this paper was to determine if these lane drop markings in conjunction with raised pavement markers improve motorist operations at left exit lane drops. To determine the effectiveness of the markings, driver behavior was examined during daylight and evening hours before and after the lane drop markings were installed. Driver behavior was measured using frequency of lane changes and erratic maneuvers, the positions of these behaviors, and the time of day. The before-and-after data indicated that the lane drop markings were an effective treatment at the left exit lane <b>drop.</b> <b>Traffic</b> maneuvers and lane changes were both significantly reduced between the before and after periods. The data also indicated that motorists Performed their lane changes, into and out of the exit-only lane, further upstream of the gore in the after period than in the before period. It is believed that the uniqueness of the lane drop markings further emphasized a changing situation to motorists (i. e. an exit lane drop), and encouraged those drivers who desired to either enter or leave the exit-only lane to merge quicker. Awareness of the impending lane drop also encouraged fewer erratic maneuvers. Consistent use of standardized markings treatments can provide several benefits such as improved driver expectancy at exit lane drops...|$|E
