5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E

Diane is in a tempestuous relationship with a Cameroonian musician named Thomas, and when this abruptly ends, she and son Jacques turn up in Walford, {{looking for a place}} to stay. However a short time later, Thomas visits Diane and asks her to go travelling with him on tour in Africa.

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, but felt that the track list could have been shortened. Erlewine complimented some of the remixes, {{including}} those by Pet Shop Boys and Space Cowboy, adding that The Remix [...] "is not an essential addition to Gaga’s canon <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> saying... but there’s glitz and glamour to enjoy here." [...] Mark Beech, reviewing the album for Bloomberg Television, noticed that the already familiar tracks from Gaga [...] "are given a new sheen by the Pet Shop Boys and sometime Madonna producer Stuart Price." [...] Nicki Escudero from Phoenix New Times gave a positive review saying that the songs featured in The Remix {{can be a great}} addition during workouts, as well as staple dance floor music. She listed the Chew Fu remix of [...] "LoveGame" [...] as a highlight from the album. Monica Herrera from Billboard complimented the album saying [...] "Gaga has employed a collection of more-than-capable producers to make her dance-ready smashes from The Fame and The Fame Monster even more danceworthy." [...] Giving it three out of five stars, Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone noted an uneven sequencing among the tracks in The Remix. She felt that the Passion Pit remix of [...] "Telephone" [...] was the best remix on the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> saying that One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named Na, Na, Na. It {{was impossible to tell}} which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E
500|$|Monk {{carries out}} futile and endless {{attempts}} {{to make the world}} [...] "balanced". Monk is fixated with symmetry, {{going so far as to}} always cut his pancakes into squares. He strongly prefers familiarity and rigorous structure in his activities. Monk only drinks Sierra Springs water throughout seasons 1–5 and a fictional brand (Summit Creek) throughout seasons 6–8, to the point that in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico", Monk <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> drinking for several days because he cannot find any Sierra Springs. Monk also has great difficulty in standard social situations, so much so that he must write down common small talk phrases on note cards in an attempt to successfully socialize. While his obsessive attention to minute detail cripples him socially, it makes him a gifted detective and profiler. He has a photographic memory, and can reconstruct entire crime scenes based on little more than scraps of detail that seem unimportant to his colleagues. His trademark method of examining a crime scene, which Sharona used to call his [...] "Zen Sherlock Holmes thing", is to wander seemingly aimlessly around a crime scene, occasionally holding up his hands, as though framing a shot for a photograph. Shalhoub explained in an interview that Monk does this because it [...] "isolates and cuts the crime scene into slices" [...] and causes Monk to look at parts of the crime scene instead of the whole.|$|E
