5|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>or</b> Police Linked Service – In {{countries}} such as the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and France ambulances can be operated by the local <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> police service, more commonly the fire service due to overlapping calls. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective, or by service preference such as in LA where the LAFD prefers to handle all parts of emergency medicine in-house. In some cases {{this can lead to}} an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as a fire truck.|$|E

5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E

5|$|Company Ambulance – Many large {{factories}} and other industrial centres, such as chemical plants, oil refineries, breweries and distilleries, have ambulance {{services provided by}} employers {{as a means of}} protecting their interests and the welfare of their staff. These are often used as first response vehicles {{in the event of a}} <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} bracts act as petals {{to attract}} insects such as hoverflies, native bees, and small beetles that pollinate the florets. Grasshoppers also visit the flower heads. The caterpillars of Tebenna micalis {{have been recorded}} on this species, as have those of the Australian painted lady (Vanessa kershawi). The tiny fruits are dispersed by wind, and germinate and grow after <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> on disturbed ground.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E

5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation <b>fire,</b> <b>or</b> veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Government Ambulance Service – Operating {{separately}} from (although alongside) {{the fire and}} police service of the area, these ambulances are funded by local or national government. In some countries, these only tend {{to be found in}} big cities, whereas in countries such as the United Kingdom almost all emergency ambulances are part of a nationwide system under the National Health Service. In Canada ambulance services are normally operated by local municipalities or provincial health agencies as a separate entity from <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> police services.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designated}} the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, {{died in a}} plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, friendly <b>fire,</b> <b>or</b> combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.|$|E

5|$|Other supernatural {{abilities}} commonly {{attributed to}} the kitsune include possession, mouths or tails that generate <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> lightning (known as kitsunebi), willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, {{and the creation of}} illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second moon in the sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.|$|E
5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
5|$|The French {{corvette}} {{had been}} struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at Ceylon, the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to Ceylon without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although {{it is not clear}} whether Victor opened <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> not before the British surrender). Victors men boarded Ceylon and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Soul Reaver is a hack and slash system, {{involving}} {{the use of}} combinations of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's enemies are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human enemies include peasants, vampire hunters and vampire worshippers. In the spectral realm, players fight minor enemies called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire enemies has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral enemies can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into a stunned state and then destroyed by impaling them, lighting them on <b>fire,</b> <b>or</b> tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, enemies leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases in the material realm and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical realm, but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Planet is a 2D {{platform}} and action game featuring anthropomorphized animal characters and 16-bit style graphics mimicking {{the look of}} games released for the Sega Genesis, particularly the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game puts players {{in the role of}} one of the available playable characters as they traverse each level, fighting enemies and obstacles before facing a boss at the end. Players have a health meter, which can be replenished by collecting red leaves, and a regenerative energy meter used to perform each character's unique special moves. Players can earn extra lives by collecting blue crystals found throughout the level, or by rescuing creatures trapped in cages. Players can also obtain various types of shields, some of which often bonus attributes such as invulnerabilty to <b>fire</b> <b>or</b> the ability to breathe underwater, and invincibility power-ups. Cards are hidden through the levels, which unlock bonus content such as music and concept art, and bonus tokens which allows access to a bonus game {{at the end of the}} level.|$|E
