25|$|The voltage {{at which}} the {{dielectric}} becomes conductive is called the breakdown voltage, and is given by {{the product of the}} <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> and the separation between the electrodes. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> depends on temperature, frequency, shape of the electrodes, etc. Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component, the operating voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage.

25|$|Most {{discrete}} capacitor types {{have greater}} or smaller capacitance changes with increasing frequencies. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of class 2 ceramic and plastic film diminishes with rising frequency. Therefore, their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency.

The graph on the right hand side shows typical frequency behavior for class 2 vs class 1 capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{thickness}} of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage, the dielectric thickness can be tailored to the rated voltage of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10V electrolytic capacitor has a dielectric thickness of only about 0.014µm, a 100V electrolytic capacitor of only about 0.14µm. Thus, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> also influences the size of the capacitor.

40|$|The {{microwave}} {{dielectric properties}} of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes {{are characterized by}} a two-port transmission line technique. Two dielectric relaxation modes are observed in the microwave region (0. 045 – 26 GHz) at 25 °C. The higher frequency process observed is identified as the cooperative relaxation of bulk-like water, whose amount was found to increase linearly with water content in the polymer. The lower-frequency process, characterized by longer relaxation times (20 - 70 picoseconds), is attributed to water molecules that are loosely bound to sulfonate groups. The loosely bound water amount was found to increase with hydration level at low water content, and levels-off at higher water contents.

The minimum thickness of the dielectric layer, which today (2013) for low voltage capacitors is in the size range of 0.5 micrometers is limited downwards by the grain size of the ceramic powder.

For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E

25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit.

25|$|The {{dielectric}} films, {{depending on}} the desired <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength,</b> are drawn in a special process to an extremely thin thickness, and are then provided with electrodes. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc applied directly {{to the surface of}} the plastic film, or a separate metallic foil. Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting space requirements on a printed circuit board, or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body. Film capacitors, together with ceramic capacitors and electrolytic capacitors, are the most common capacitor types for use in electronic equipment, and are used in many AC and DC microelectronics and electronics circuits.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum energy}} is a {{function}} of dielectric volume, permittivity, and <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength.</b> Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store, so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates. In addition, these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates. In reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric, for example between the sides of the capacitor plates, which increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor. This is sometimes called parasitic capacitance. For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically. It becomes negligibly small when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large.|$|E

The fitting of the data by the Havriliak–Negami function provided the temperature behaviour of conductivity, relaxation times, <b>dielectric</b> <b>strengths</b> and shape parameters. The glass transition phenomenon was detected by the changes of both the relaxation strength and the low frequency slope of the secondary relaxation, and a transition temperature TB > Tg between two different relaxation regimes, coincident with the splitting temperature of the systems, was also recognised.

50|$|As {{the high}} {{electronegativity}} of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the atom, fluorocarbons are only weakly {{susceptible to the}} fleeting dipoles that {{form the basis of}} the London dispersion force. As a result, fluorocarbons have low intermolecular attractive forces and are lipophobic in addition to being hydrophobic and non-polar. Reflecting the weak intermolecular forces these compounds exhibit low viscosities when compared to liquids of similar boiling points, low surface tension and low heats of vaporization. The low attractive forces in fluorocarbon liquids make them compressible (low bulk modulus) and able to dissolve gas relatively well. Smaller fluorocarbons are extremely volatile. There are five perfluoroalkane gases; tetrafluoromethane (bp −128 °C), hexafluoroethane (bp −78.2 °C), octafluoropropane (bp −36.5 °C), perfluoro-n-butane (bp −2.2 °C) and perfluoro-iso-butane (bp −1 °C). Nearly all other fluoroalkanes are liquids; the most notable exception is perfluorocyclohexane, which sublimes at 51 °C.
