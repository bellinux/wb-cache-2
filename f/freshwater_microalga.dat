The microalga {{was exposed to}} different concentrations of the effluent obtained by diluting the dye effluent from 100 to 175 times in bold basal medium (BBM).

Contents of seventeen amino acids in algal samples were determined by using ion-exchange chromatography. Results: Autotrophic growth regime in a solar photobioreactor and in an outdoor open circulating cascade-type cultivation apparatus in a thin-layer provided algal biomass with higher amino acid contents than cultivation in a laboratory regime and heterotrophic cultivation in a fermenter.

In our previous study, we demonstrated growth promotion effect of SMS to Spirulina, a <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalgae</b> (Nogami 2016). However, the growth promotion mechanism of SMS is still unclear. Although there are current prevailing opinions, such as the fertilization effect of eluted iron necessary for photosynthesis (Yamamoto et al. 2016) or the contribution of dissolved CO 2 via increase in the pH of the medium (Takahashi et al. 2012), there are no unified views to explain growth promotion effect of SMS.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of pH, ionic strength, presence of humic or alginic acids, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), or <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalga</b> Chlorella kesslerii on {{the stability and}} transformation of carboxyl-PEG-CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) in terms of number, hydrodynamic size and fluorescence of individual particles, was studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Obtained results demonstrated that QDs form stable dispersions at nanomolar concentrations under conditions typical for freshwaters. The presence of 5 or 15 mg C L- 1 of humic acid or 50 mg C L- 1 EPS did not significantly affect these parameters. In contrast, 5 or 50 mg C L- 1 alginate at ionic strength of 10 mM shifted the hydrodynamic radius toward larger values, suggesting a possible capture of QDs by the linear alginate chains. The addition of microalga to the QD dispersions resulted in a slight reduction {{of the number of}} QDs and a significant decline in the fluorescence of individual QDs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{elevated}} pH and salt concentration {{on the growth}} of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalga</b> Neochloris oleoabundans was investigated. A study was conducted in 24 -well plates on the design of a growth medium and subsequently applied in a photobioreactor. An artificial seawater medium with reduced Ca(2 +) and PO(4) (3 -) could prevent mineral precipitation at high pH levels. Growth was characterized in this new medium at pH 8. 1 and at pH 10. 0, with 420 mM of total salts. Specific growth rates of 0. 08 h(- 1) at pH 8. 1 and 0. 04 h(- 1) at pH 10. 0 were obtained under controlled turbidostat cultivation. The effect of nitrogen starvation on lipid accumulation was also investigated. Fatty acids content increased not only with nitrogen limitation but also with a pH increase (up to 35 % in the dry biomass). Fluorescence microscopy gave visual proof that N. oleoabundans accumulates oil bodies when growing in saline conditions at high pH...|$|E
40|$|Scenedesmus obtusus, a <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalga,</b> was {{evaluated}} for its growth and biochemical characteristics under various culture conditions. S. obtusus was tolerant at all tested CO 2 concentrations up to 20 %. Among the different nitrogen sources, urea showed enhanced biomass productivities up to 2 -fold compared to control, where the nitrogen source was sodium nitrate. Light intensity and photoperiod {{had a significant}} effect on growth rate and biomass productivity. The growth rate was observed maximum under continuous light exposure at the light intensities, 30 lmol m (2) sec (1) and 60 lmol m (2) sec (1) The species was able to tolerate the salinity levels up to 25 mM NaCl, where, the increase in the concentration of NaCl suppressed the growth. Ammonium acetate and glycine showed better growth rate and biomass productivity indicating mixotrophic ability of S. obtusus. Supplementation of acetate and bicarbonate significantly enhanced the biomass productivity. Biodiesel properties of S. obtusus cultivated at various culture conditions were estimated.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel flocculant for harvesting Chlorella vulgaris as model species for <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalgae</b> based on cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), synthesized from a renewable and biodegradable resource. Cationic pyridinium groups were grafted onto CNCs by two separate one-pot simultaneous esterification and nucleophilic substitution reactions. Both types of modified CNCs were positively {{charged in the}} pH range 4 - 11. Both reactions yielded CNCs {{with a high degree}} of substitution (up to 0. 38). A maximum flocculation efficiency of 100 % was achieved at a dosage of 0. 1 g g− 1 biomass. In contrast to conventional polymer flocculants, cationic CNCs were relatively insensitive to inhibition of flocculation by algal organic matter. The present results highlight the potential of these new type of nanocellulose-based flocculants for microalgae harvesting. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ecotoxicity}} of artificially alterated cerium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-CeO 2) suspensions {{was determined}} using the <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalgae</b> growth inhibition test. The agglomeration or aggregation {{state of the}} alterated suspensions was followed because it {{represents one of the}} obvious modifications when nanoparticles reached the environment. In addition, its influence on the ecotoxicity of nanoparticles is currently not well-addressed. Our results showed that the suspensions were stable within the first 24 h and then agglomerate up to 10 mu m after 3 and 30 days. The inhibitory effect on the growth of exposed algae was however similar whatever the tested suspension. This supports the fact that the agglomeration state of nano-CeO 2, in our conditions, has few influences on the ecotoxicity toward these organisms. The EC 50 values were 5. 6; 4. 1 and 6. 2 mg L- 1, after exposure to non aged, 3 and 30 days aged suspensions respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoupling an {{anaerobic}} digester to a microalgal culture has received increasing attention {{as an alternative}} process for combined bioenergy production and depollution. In this article, a dynamic model for anaerobic digestion of microalgae is developed {{with the aim of}} improving the management of such a coupled system. This model describes the dynamics of inorganic nitrogen and volatile fatty acids since both can lead to inhibition and therefore process instability. Three reactions are considered: Two hydrolysis-acidogenesis steps in parallel for sugars/lipids and for proteins, followed by a methanogenesis step. The proposed model accurately reproduces experimental data for anaerobic digestion of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>microalgae</b> Chlorella vulgaris with an organic loading rate of 1 gCOD[*]L− 1 [*]d− 1. In particular, the three-reaction pathway allows to adequately represent the observed decoupling between biogas production and nitrogen release. The reduced complexity of this model makes it suitable for developing advanced, model-based control and monitoring strategie...|$|R
