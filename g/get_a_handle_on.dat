25|$|Changing {{times and}} the rise of {{television}} saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11, 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness. Since then, he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.|$|E

At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him a}} [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E

2500|$|O'Neill's 2007 {{positive}} {{test for}} the prescription medication, Phentermine, {{for which he was}} legally prescribed, and which was legal OUT of competition, but not IN competition, there were then, and have been MANY high-profile positives since, revealed within the professional peloton, and these for actual performance enhancers, i.e., EPO, Growth Hormone, Steroids. These are medications that have NEVER been legal in the professional peloton, (Ivan Basso, Floyd Landis, Alejandro Valverde [...] Michael Rasmussen, Christian Vandevelde, George Hincapie, Tom Danielson, Levi Leipheimer, David Zabriski, Matt White, Lance Armstrong, etc. just to name a few.)

2500|$|Lynch {{also added}} new characters, like Mr. Reindeer and Sherilyn Fenn as {{the victim of}} a car accident. During rehearsals, Lynch began talking about Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe with Cage and Dern. The {{director}} acquired a copy of Elvis' Golden Records and after listening to it, called Cage and told him that he had to sing two songs, [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "Love Me Tender". The actor agreed and recorded them so that he could lip-synch to them on the set. At one point, Cage called Lynch and asked if he could wear a snakeskin jacket in the film and Lynch incorporated it into his script. Before filming started, Dern suggested that she and Cage go on a weekend road trip to Las Vegas in order to bond and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> their characters. Dern remembers, [...] "We agreed that Sailor and Lula needed to be one person, one character, and we would each share it. I got the sexual, wild, Marilyn, gum-chewing fantasy, female side; Nickâ€™s got the snakeskin, Elvis, raw, combustible, masculine side". Within four months, Lynch began filming on August 9, 1989 in both Los Angeles (including the San Fernando Valley) and New Orleans with a relatively modest budget of $10 million. Originally, the film featured more explicit erotic scenes between Sailor and Lula. In one, she has an orgasm while relating to Sailor a dream she had of being ripped open by a wild animal. Another deleted scene had Lula lowering herself onto Sailor's face saying, [...] "Take a bite out of Lula".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Strategic alliances have {{demonstrated}} tremendous impact in reducing total purchasing spend and enhancing innovative product design. However, the reservoir of capable and willing suppliers is limited. Thus, effective supply managers {{need to develop}} the ability to promote commitment to alliances among suppliers. Effective alliances imply designing aspects of the supply chain, selection of appropriate suppliers, and leveraging effective partnering behavior where appropriate. This presentation will help supply managers work their way through this process. Introduction. In general, we do not design supply chains.

In this paper, we focus on the case study of BabelNet, a large multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and semantic network, to describe in detail how such knowledge resources are built, improved and exploited for crucial NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation, Entity Linking and Semantic Similarity...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few months, I found {{a simple way to}} rid myself of my self-assur-ance: I tried to {{estimate}} the cost and sched-ule for a Web development project.

By generating thousands of Web objects and making them operational in just a few months, this quickened pace raises pressing questions.
