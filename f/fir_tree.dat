25|$|Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, botanists paid {{frequent}} {{visits to}} the area to collect plant specimens. Among them were John Bartram, who crossed the Roan Highlands in the late 1730s while studying the botanical make-up {{of what is now}} the southeastern United States. Andre Micheaux followed in 1794, discovering several alpine species rarely found outside of the New England and Canadian latitudes. In 1799, John Fraser explored Roan Mountain, collecting specimens of rhododendron and noting the existence of the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> that now bears his name. Other early explorers included Elisha Mitchell, for whom Mount Mitchell is named, and Harvard botanist Asa Gray.|$|E
500|$|Several estate cottages near Weston Lodge were {{designed}} by W. E. Nesfield between 1860 and 1866, and are among his earliest works. They include Stowford and Magnolia Cottages (1864–65), which Nikolaus Pevsner describes as [...] "cheerful and just a little Kate Greenaway", Smithy Cottage (around 1865) and <b>Fir</b> <b>Tree</b> Cottage (1865), all listed at grade II, {{as well as a}} half-timbered farmhouse on Weston Road. Rather than either the Jacobean mansion or its High Victorian interiors, their style derives from buildings of the Home Counties, with tile hanging, incised pargetting, half-hipped gables and high chimneys. Pevsner credits Nesfield with introducing these features to Cheshire.|$|E
500|$|Andersen {{retained}} story {{ideas in}} his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life, and telling stories such as “The Snowman” was a compulsion with him. The tale {{has been described as}} poignant and lyrical, and as a self-mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning, unreciprocated pain, and that he would end his life partnerless and alone. The light-hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersen’s tragic <b>Fir</b> <b>Tree</b> and, in telling the tale, Andersen returns “to his earlier, tragicomic mode of sketching the fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form.” ...|$|E

Amidst small arms and artillery-fire, the brigade charged towards Krithia and gained , about [...] short of the objective, with [...] Near <b>Fir</b> <b>Tree</b> Spur, the New Zealanders managed to get forward and link up with the Australians, although the British were held up and the French were exhausted, despite having occupied a point overlooking their objective.

500|$|German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer {{described}} Elvela (subsequently Helvella) purpurascens in 1774. Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen gave it {{the name}} Clavaria elveloides in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> forests around Klagenfurt in August and was common around Hüttenberg. He recorded that poor people ate it, giving it the local name hare's ear. In 1796, mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon described G.clavatus as Merulius clavatus, noting that it grew in grassy locations in woods. He noted {{it was the same}} species that Schäffer had described. The specific epithet—derived from the Latin word clava (club) and meaning [...] "club-shaped"—refers to the shape of young fruit bodies. In his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, Persoon placed Merulius clavatus (recognising two varieties—violaceus and spadiceus) in the section Gomphus within Merulius.|$|E

French troops were to capture Kereves Dere and the British, Australians and New Zealanders were assigned Krithia and Achi Baba. After [...] of artillery preparation, the assault began at mid-morning on 6 May. The British and French advanced along the Gully, <b>Fir</b> <b>Tree,</b> Krithia and Kereves spurs which were separated by deep gullies, fortified by the Ottomans. As the attackers advanced, they became separated when trying to outflank Ottoman strongpoints and found themselves in unfamiliar terrain. Under artillery and then machine-gun fire from Ottoman outposts that had not been spotted by British aerial reconnaissance, the attack was stopped; next day, reinforcements resumed the advance.|$|E

500|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle as Agaricus aurantiacus in 1781, reporting that {{it appeared in}} the <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> forests around Klagenfurt in October. He added {{that it could be}} confused with the chanterelle by the inexperienced, but that its true nature was very different; in contrast to its edible lookalike, he described it as [...] "kind of pernicious". The specific epithet is the Latin word aurantiacus, meaning [...] "orange". James Sowerby illustrated it and gave it the name Agaricus subcantharellus, describing it as a [...] "perhaps unfavourable" [...] variety of A.cantharellus (chanterelle). The fungus was placed in the genus Merulius by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and then Cantharellus by Elias Fries in 1821. Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded it could only be classified in the genus Clitocybe in 1900, based on its white spores, decurrent gills and lack of a ring. It was elevated to the status of genus in Emile Martin-Sans' 1929 publication L'Empoisonnement par les champignons et particulièrement les intoxications dues aux Agaricacées du groupe des Clitocybe et du groupe des Cortinarius, with authorship attributed to René Maire. Martin-Sans concurred with Maire's assessment of Hygrophoropsis, suggesting that it represented a form intermediate between Cantharellus and Clitocybe, and was thus worthy of generic ranking. [...] The genus name refers to a resemblance to the genus Hygrophorus. It is commonly known as the false chanterelle.|$|E

Totor is victorious, and throws his three captors out of the building. [...] He discovers his uncle tied to a chair; Totor frees him, and Pad tells his nephew that the bandits kidnapped his aunt Save. [...] Totor suddenly has an idea to use the treasure he found as a ransom for his aunt. [...] The two of them set out to go fetch it, but along the way a criminal steals their map while they sleep. After discovering the loss of their jewels they follow the thief's unique footprints for a few miles. [...] When they see another set of footprints join the first and then head up into some mountains, Totor continues on his own. Having eluded several Native sentries he spies the chest {{in the hands of the}} Chief. After recovering the box and outrunning the Natives back to his uncle, they hurriedly head home. [...] There they find a ransom note from the leader of the bandits, Jim Blackcat, saying to meet them under a big <b>fir</b> <b>tree</b> that day or they would kill his aunt. [...] Totor rushes to the rendezvous where he overwhelms the criminals and orders them to tell him where they are keeping his aunt hostage. After a heroic rescue and an emotional reunion between his aunt and uncle, he finds out that it is time for him to go back to Belgium.
