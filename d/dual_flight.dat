500|$|The flight {{would be}} made in Reid's Cessna 177B Cardinal, a four-seat {{single-engine}} propeller aircraft manufactured in 1975, registered N35207, which like most aircraft had <b>dual</b> <b>flight</b> controls in the front. Jessica {{would sit in the}} front left seat, Reid in the front right, and Lloyd in the back. It was agreed that Reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates, plus compensation for the layover time. Reid reportedly told his wife that he considered the flight a [...] "non-event for aviation", simply [...] "flying cross country with a 7-year-old sitting next to you and the parents paying for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which {{flew the}} Phantom with a Naval Aviator (pilot) {{in the front}} seat and a Naval Flight Officer as a radar {{intercept}} officer (RIO) in the back seat, the USAF initially flew its Phantoms with a rated Air Force Pilot in front and back seats. While the rear pilot (GIB, or [...] "guy in back") could fly and ostensibly land the aircraft, he had fewer flight instruments and a very restricted forward view. The Air Force later assigned a rated Air Force Navigator qualified as a weapon/targeting systems officer (later designated as weapon systems officer or WSO) in the rear seat instead of another pilot. However, all USAF Phantoms retained <b>dual</b> <b>flight</b> controls throughout their service life.|$|E
500|$|MacLachlan was {{not given}} time to settle in. His first flight was in a Tiger Moth on 2 March 1937 in which he gained a 45-minute {{experience}} in an open-cockpit. He flew solo {{for the first time}} on 9 March after rapidly coming to grips with his trainer. He wrote, [...] "You will be glad to hear I went solo today...Mr Sharp did a slow roll. It was pretty grim when we were upside down with nothing but 6,000 feet of air between us and the ground.....I simply love flying." [...] MacLachlan was the youngest trainee of the group and after 23 solo and 28 hours <b>dual</b> <b>flight</b> he passed as an average grade pilot on the 27 April. He had come second overall in his examinations. He travelled to RAF Uxbridge the following month. There, he was commissioned acting pilot officer service number 39639 on 18 May 1937. He was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham in Lincolnshire. He flew the Hawker Hart and the Hawker Audax {{for the first time on}} 20 May 1938. He enjoyed the speed of the aircraft immensely and indulged in his passion for motor cars by buying an Austin 7 from a Nottingham dealership with his first pay cheque for £14 7s.|$|E
50|$|With the {{certification}} of Entegra Release 9 system in April 2009, Avidyne offers <b>dual</b> integrated <b>flight</b> displays (IFD) with the FMS900w, a WAAS-capable flight management system (FMS) that utilizes Avidyne’s all-digital DVX740 VHF NAV/COM radio modules and GPS722 GPS receiver modules, which eliminates {{the reliance on}} 3rd-party Garmin 430 radios. The Release 9 upgrade also includes the Avidyne MLB700 which provides Sirius/XM Satellite Datalink Weather from WSI.|$|R

2500|$|Alongside {{the pilot}} in an A-26B, {{a crew member}} {{typically}} served as navigator and gun loader for the pilot-operated nose guns. In an A-26C, that crew member served as navigator and bombardier, and relocated to the nose section for the bombing phase of an operation. A small number of A-26Cs were fitted with <b>dual</b> <b>flight</b> controls, some parts {{of which could be}} disabled in flight to allow limited access to the nose section. A tractor-style [...] "jump seat" [...] was located behind the [...] "navigator's seat." [...] In most missions, a third crew member in the rear gunner's compartment operated the remotely controlled dorsal and ventral gun turrets, with access to and from the cockpit possible via the bomb bay only when that was empty.|$|E
2500|$|The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe {{featured}} the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls {{which could be}} mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using safety glass and the door window panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had <b>dual</b> <b>flight</b> controls, low pressure tires and mohair interior. Both models featured dual engine throttle controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the brake lever. The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and [...] $4,985 for the Deluxe.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSince 1992 {{ozonesonde}} measurements {{have been}} performed at La Reunion Island located at 21 °S and 55. 5 °E in the southwest Indian Ocean. In 1998, this site joined the Southern Hemisphere Additional OZonesondes (SHADOZ) program allowing to improve the frequency of measurements to once a week. Since the start of ozonesonde measurement at La Reunion Island, some instrumental changes have occurred, such as the cathode solution concentration, and the meteorological radiosonde system from Vaisala to Modem. The influence of this last modification on data has been analyzed with several <b>dual</b> <b>flights.</b> In November 2011, {{in collaboration with the}} Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), simultaneous measurements have been made combining the Modem, 2 types of Vaisala sondes and the Cryogenic Frost point Hygrometer (CFH). Tropospheric ozone trends have been estimated. Considering the whole tropospheric column, a positive trend has been observed. Trend calculations have also been investigated, separating the troposphere into different layers and according to seasons. The strongest trends are observed in the upper troposphere, and during austral winter. The purpose of this presentation is to describe the instrumentation, its evolution and the impact of instrumental changes, to discuss intercomparisons between different sondes and to present long-term trends characteristics...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} epidemiologic {{study of}} airsickness in early flight training. FINDINGS It {{was found that}} airsickness in itself does not differentiate good from poor students.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} aerodynamic studies {{for the design}} of a <b>dual</b> mode ramjet <b>flight</b> test vehicle which were performed within joint DLR/ONERA research cooperation JAPHAR (Joint Airbreathing Propulsion for Hypersonic Application Research). The cooperation is organized around the blue-print of a possible experimental vehicle that provides a solid context for the different studies and allows to synthesise all the results through the propulsive balance. The design of the experimental vehicle is studied within the first working group (WG 1) of JAPHAR. The work of WG 1 is shared between DLR (Institute of Design Aerodynamics) and ONERA. The present report summarises the work of DLR Braunschweig. It gives a short introduction into the cooperation and describes the design studies for the experimental vehicles investigated until now. Within a detailed comparison of a common wing-body vehicle and a waverider configuration the effects of forebody shape, vehicle mass, dynamic pressure and the propulsion system on the definition of a <b>dual</b> mode ramjet <b>flight</b> test vehicle, the trim losses and the trajectory definition are discussed. Based on this first comparison, a wing-body combination with a very efficient waverider forebody is designed and analyzed.
