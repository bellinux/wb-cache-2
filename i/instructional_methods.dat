Two outcome dimensions were measured: student grades and learning engagement. A preprest-posttest control group experimental design was used. The experimental group (n= 134) received the interactive Facebook <b>instructional</b> <b>method,</b> and the control group students (n= 57) received the non-Facebook <b>instructional</b> <b>method.</b> Data pertaining to student Facebook use and activities were also collected. Independent samples t-tests were used to measure significant differences in grades and engagement between the Facebook and non-Facebook classroom contexts. Pearson’s correlation coefficient {{was used to measure}} the relationships between interactive Facebook <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> and grades. A linear regression was also performed to analyze the predictors of student grades. Content analyses of samples of Facebook communication exchanges were also conducted. The results revealed that experimental group had a significant positive effect on grades and engagement. This study concludes that Facebook use in <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> assists students in achieving better grades, higher engagement, and greater satisfaction with the university learning experience. Thus, the authors provides experimental evidence that Facebook can be used as an educational communication and interaction tool to enable faculty to assume a more active and participatory role...|$|R

2500|$|Scottish Gaelic has a rich oral (...) {{and written}} tradition, having been the {{language}} of the bardic culture of the Highland clans for many years. The language preserves knowledge of and adherence to pre-feudal laws and customs, the salience of which was evident in the complaints and claims of the Highland Land League in the late 19th century, which elected MPs to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. However, the language suffered under centralization efforts by the Scottish and later British states, especially after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, during the Highland Clearances, and by the exclusion of Scottish Gaelic from the educational system. Even before then, charitable schools operated by the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge used <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> designed to suppress the language in favour of English and corporal punishment against students using Gaelic.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effects of a {{problem-solving}} heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> on Grade 6 learners’ achievements in algebra. Two main theories inspired the design of this teaching method, namely the modelling and modelling perspective, and action, process, object, schema (APOS) theory. Modelling and modelling perspectives guided the development of modelling-eliciting activities used in the teaching method and the APOS theory guided the sequence of activities used to develop Grade 6 learners’ conceptions in algebra. The impact of the problem-solving heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> was investigated with 198 Grade 6 learners from four different primary schools in the Zululand district of Kwazulu-Natal that were conveniently sampled. A mixed-method approach was used in this study and a hypothesis was formulated to investigate the effects of the teaching method on the learners’ achievements in algebra. The qualitative component consisted of a pre-intervention class observation of mathematics lessons of all four mathematics educators in the schools used for this study. The design and implementation of the problem-solving heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> and the quantitative component employed non-equivalent control group design with pre-test and post-test measure. The main instruments for data collection were an observation schedule to document sequence of events in the classroom during the class observation, a standardized achievement test in algebra used to measure effects of the problem-solving heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> and modelling-eliciting activities used as a medium of interaction between learners and the researcher during the implementation of the problem-solving heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method.</b> Findings from the class observation indicated all four schools made use of comparable traditional methods of instruction. The implementation of the problem-solving <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> gave insights into how a problem-solving heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> can be developed and used in Grade 6 algebra lessons, and the factors that could influence learners’ conceptual development in algebra. The findings from the quantitative component supported the initial hypothesis that improved scores in algebra are achieved through participation in the problem-solving heuristic <b>instructional</b> <b>method.</b> Quantitative data was analysed using the t-test, analysis of covariance, Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique and the effect size.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether different instructional methodologies {{have an impact}} on learning a complex accounting task: tax provision work. To become proficient in making tax provision judgments, an accountant must understand the rules and principles of GAAP and the rules and regulations governing income tax reporting. However, these two sets of rules are often in direct opposition. Using cognitive load theory and constructivist learning theory as a framework, this study predicted how schema acquisition, a key component of learning, could improve tax provision performance. Greater schema acquisition should in turn lead to more accurate performance. Hypotheses include the following: (a) participants who learn using a systems <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> will perform better than participants who learn using traditional <b>instructional</b> <b>method,</b> (b) participants who practice actively should perform better than participants who practice passively, and (c) the relationship between <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> and performance will be moderated by the practice method. These hypotheses were tested using a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment, manipulating <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> and practice method as independent variables. The results of this study are inconclusive. The statistically significant findings are invalid due to potentially unequal pre-tax knowledge among the subjects, and several hypotheses were not supported. The results of this study had the potential to benefit theory, practice, and education by identifying the most effective combination of <b>instructional</b> <b>method</b> and practice method to build a tax provision schema in a novice learner. However, due to design flaws, this study did not realize that potential...|$|R
