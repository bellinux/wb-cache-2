5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramped</b> conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E

Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramped</b> Straits of Salamis. There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised.

5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible. If Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, {{he would be in}} a strong position to force an Allied surrender; conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Allies could prevent conquest from being completed. The Allied fleet thus remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell, the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. Partly because of deception by Themistocles, the navies met <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramped</b> Straits of Salamis.

Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramped</b> terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen.

5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramped</b> repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.|$|E

40|$|Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, sudden contractions of {{skeletal}} {{muscles that}} can cause detrimental effects on athletic performance. Recent data suggest that low intakes of dietary calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) can enhance or cause muscle <b>cramps.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the correlation between Ca and Mg intakes and muscle cramping in female college athletes. Athletes completed a 24 -hour dietary recall and a survey on frequency and location of muscle cramps. Of those surveyed, 8 participated in basketball, 21 in softball, and 10 in gymnastics. Calcium and Mg intakes were calculated from dietary recall data using Food Processor® nutrient analysis software. Data are reported as means ± standard deviation (SD). T-tests were performed to determine significant differences between groups. The average daily intakes of Ca above and below the dietary reference intake (DRI) were 1516 ± 559 mg/day and 504 ± 296 mg/day, respectively, for <b>the</b> athletes that <b>cramped</b> and 1620 ± 299 mg/day and 645 ± 250 mg/day, respectively, for the athletes that did not experience <b>cramping.</b> <b>The</b> average daily intakes above and below the DRI for Mg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramping</b> group were 423 ± 103 mg/day and 180 ± 65 mg/day, respectively.

25|$|Evans, at one point, {{published}} an {{assertion that the}} disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; {{because it would have}} been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard to tell what order they should be in.

500|$|In 1963, Stanley Kubrick cast Sellers {{to appear}} in [...] {{alongside}} George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens. Sellers and Kubrick got on famously during the film's production and had the greatest of respect for each other, also sharing a love of photography. The director asked Sellers to play four roles: US President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF and Major T. J. [...] "King" [...] Kong. Sellers was initially hesitant about taking on these divergent characters, but Kubrick prevailed. According to some accounts, Sellers was also invited to play the part of General Buck Turgidson, but turned it down {{because it was too}} physically demanding. Kubrick later commented that the idea of having Sellers in so many of the film's key roles was that [...] "everywhere you turn there is some version of Peter Sellers holding the fate of the world in his hands". Sellers was especially anxious about successfully enacting the role of Kong and accurately affecting a Texan accent. Kubrick requested screenwriter Terry Southern to record in his natural accent a tape of Kong's lines. After practising with Southern's recording, Sellers got sufficient control of the accent, and started shooting the scenes in the aeroplane. After the first day's shooting, Sellers sprained his ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cramped</b> cockpit set. Kubrick then re-cast Slim Pickens as Kong. The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct, [...] "variegated, complex and refined", and critic Alexander Walker considered that these roles [...] "showed his genius at full stretch". Sellers played Muffley as a bland, placid intellectual in the mould of Adlai Stevenson; he played Mandrake as an unflappable Englishman; and Dr. Strangelove, a character influenced by pre-war German cinema, as a wheelchair-bound fanatic. The critic for The Times wrote that the film includes, [...] "three remarkable performances from Mr. Peter Sellers, masterly as the President, diverting as a revue-sketch ex-Nazi US Scientist... and acceptable as an RAF officer, although the critic from The Guardian thought his portrayal of the RAF officer alone was, [...] "worth the price of an admission ticket". For his performance in all three roles, Sellers was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 37th Academy Awards, and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.|$|E

Nocturnal leg cramps were present in 185 children for an overall incidence of 7. 3 %. Leg cramps were noted only in children aged > or = 8 years. The incidence increased at 12 years and peaked at 16 to 18 years of age. A majority (81. 6 %) of the affected children had nocturnal leg cramps 1 to 4 times per year. The mean duration of episodes was 1. 7 minutes. Leg cramps were unilateral in 98. 9 % of cases and the ipsilateral foot also was involved in 18. 9 % of cases. One hundred thirty-five (73 %) children had leg cramps while asleep, and the remaining 23 (12. 4 %) children had leg cramps in either state. Fifty-seven (30. 8 %) children had residual tenderness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affected muscles. The mean duration of residual tenderness was 33. 2 minutes (range: 2 minutes- 1 day).
