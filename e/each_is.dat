5|$|Although the two {{are built}} on the same game engine, Oracle of Ages {{concentrates}} on puzzles, while Oracle of Seasons focuses on action. <b>Each</b> <b>is</b> a complete game capable of interacting with the other, via passwords or a Game Link Cable.|$|E
5|$|Archaeocytes (or amoebocytes) are amoeba-like {{cells that}} are totipotent, in other words <b>each</b> <b>is</b> capable of {{transformation}} into {{any other type of}} cell. They also have important roles in feeding and in clearing debris that block the ostia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>is</b> listed {{with the}} -ma suffix (or its allomorph), which signals aspectual unmarkedness.|$|E

50|$|The plant {{consists}} of four units. The first two, at 350 MWe <b>each,</b> <b>were</b> launched in 1965 and 1966. The other two units, at 648 MWe <b>each,</b> <b>were</b> launched in 1969 and 1970.|$|R
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} the top three {{in terms of the number}} of titles won in Masters 1000 tournaments. Djokovic and Nadal are ranked first with a record 30 titles, Federer is ranked third with 27 titles in the open era.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} has 38 diploid chromosomes. However, unlike {{others in the}} {{subfamily}} Tragelaphinae, the X chromosome and Y chromosome are compound and <b>each</b> <b>is</b> fused with one of two identical autosomes.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the smaller}} Biblical scenes and {{supported}} by the Ignudi are ten circular parade shields, sometimes described as being painted to resemble bronze. Known examples are actually of lacquered and gilt wood. <b>Each</b> <b>is</b> decorated with a picture drawn from the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha.|$|E
50|$|First, ten {{columns of}} three cards <b>each</b> <b>are</b> dealt face down, then the top card of <b>each</b> column <b>is</b> turned face up.|$|R

5|$|Brad and Janet {{are shown}} to {{separate}} bedrooms, where <b>each</b> <b>is</b> visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) {{and then as}} Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, who she discovers, via a television monitor, is in bed with Frank. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by watching {{and listening to}} episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing {{the direction of the}} story as <b>each</b> <b>is</b> made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group <b>each</b> <b>is</b> uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
50|$|The two {{helicopters}} {{belonged to}} the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. The twelve Marines on board were all from the contiguous United States. Two <b>each</b> <b>were</b> from Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Texas; and one <b>each</b> <b>were</b> from Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon and South Carolina.|$|R
50|$|That same year, Millar Publishing Company, who {{had been}} {{publishing}} regular Wonder Wart-Hog stories since 1966, published two issues of Wonder Wart-Hog. 140,000 copies of <b>each</b> <b>were</b> printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine, and only 40,000 of <b>each</b> <b>were</b> sold.|$|R
6000|$|For some {{distance}} they sauntered in silence by {{the margin of}} the sea.

The timid girl recovered her courage before the self-reliant man! ...|$|R
5|$|Following its {{foundation}} in the United Kingdom, Scouting {{spread around the}} globe. The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, there is now at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. <b>Each</b> <b>is</b> independent, but international cooperation continues {{to be seen as}} part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.|$|E
5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since <b>each</b> <b>is</b> tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While <b>each</b> <b>is</b> presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|E
5000|$|IV Dolly, Cash, Willie, Kenny, and Jerry {{comprise}} the [...] "Square Dance Series", {{so named because}} the first pressing of <b>each</b> <b>was</b> on square-shaped vinyl. The A side tracks on <b>each</b> <b>are</b> songs from Love Their Country, while the B side tracks are outtakes from the album sessions.|$|R
50|$|Four wildcards <b>each</b> <b>were</b> {{awarded by}} {{internal}} selection to Australian players. Also, one wildcard <b>each</b> <b>was</b> {{given to the}} winners of the Australian Wildcard Playoff, a tournament between Australian players who did not receive direct entry into the draw. Jordan Thompson and Casey Dellacqua were the winners of this tournament.|$|R
50|$|While six {{are from}} Bhadrak; five <b>each</b> <b>are</b> from Bolangir, Gajapati, Kalahandi, Koraput, Mayurbhanj, Nayagarh and Paradeep. Four <b>each</b> <b>are</b> from Dhenkanal and Keonjhar; three each from Sonepur, Jharsuguda, Malkangiri and Phulbani; two each from Bargarh, East Coast Railway, Khurda, Nabarangpur and Rayagada and one each from Boudh and Nuapada.|$|R
5|$|Options for {{population}} control include fertility control, ground and helicopter shooting, and mustering and trapping. None {{of the methods}} provide complete freedom from suffering for the horses, {{and the cost of}} <b>each</b> <b>is</b> very high. The costs include those that are economic, such as research, equipment purchases, and labour expenditures, as well as moral concerns over the welfare of the horses. As a result, more effective and efficient means of control have been called for.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. <b>Each</b> <b>is</b> strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. <b>Each</b> <b>is</b> powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E

5|$|The cathedral has two {{unusual and}} often-reproduced monuments, the Berkeley memorials. These are set into niches in the wall, and <b>each</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} by a canopy of inverted cusped arches. Pearson's screen, completed in 1905, echoes these memorials in its three wide arches with flamboyant cusps.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and <b>each</b> <b>is</b> driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
5|$|The first pereiopod is {{modified}} into {{a strong}} cheliped (claw-bearing leg): the claw's fingers, the dactylus and propodus, are black at the tips. The other pereiopods {{are covered with}} rows of short stiff setae; the dactylus of <b>each</b> <b>is</b> black towards the tip, and ends in a sharp point.|$|E
