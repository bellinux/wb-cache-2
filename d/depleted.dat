5|$|<b>Depleted</b> uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of <b>depleted</b> uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. <b>Depleted</b> uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to <b>depleted</b> uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E

5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of <b>depleted</b> uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with <b>depleted</b> uranium plates. The use of <b>depleted</b> uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%.

The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of <b>depleted</b> uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.|$|E

Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached.

5000|$|... 5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) is a purported neurotoxin used in {{scientific}} research to decrease concentrations of serotonin in the brain.

What is known is that this compound is in fact not selective in <b>depleting</b> serotonin content, but also <b>depletes</b> norepinephrine. To selectively <b>deplete</b> serotonin stores, it is commonly administered in conjunction with desmethylimiprimine (desipramine)3, which inhibits the norepinephrine transporter.|$|R

In that respect, the general objective of the Paper is to present the Macedonian unique experience regarding its efforts to reduce or eliminate these substances. The following two aspects were subject to the research: national legislation which regulates the Ozone <b>Depleting</b> Substances import and export as well as the implementation of the projects that resulted with the elimination of Ozone <b>Depleting</b> Substances quantities in the period 1995 – 2010. The research outcomes confirm the starting research hypothesis i. e. that with adequately created and implemented national action, the amount of Ozone <b>Depleting</b> Substances consumption can dramatically fall.

NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.
