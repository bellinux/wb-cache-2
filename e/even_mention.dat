5|$|The Allied {{intervention}} in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant with Soviet accounts {{of a vast}} capitalist conspiracy against the world's first worker's state, some of which do not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> the First World War; he was equally indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. He argues that the interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik state.|$|E
5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being the authentic site. However, some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland {{that it could have}} been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E
25|$|On 21 and 24 October 1982, two Soviet {{national}} sports newspapers– {{the daily}} Sovetsky Sport and weekly Football-Hockey– published detailed accounts of this match, {{but did not}} <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> any spectator accident.|$|E
25|$|In the 2012 on-line {{edition of}} the OED the entry for 'bloodhound' has been brought up to date, {{for the first time}} pronouncing {{specifically}} on the etymological meaning. Clearly the editors have found no historical plausibility in the idea that the name refers to good breeding, which they do not <b>even</b> <b>mention.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} merger did not generate significant controversy {{within the}} AWSA. The call to its {{annual meeting in}} 1887, the one that authorized Stone to explore the possibility of merger, did not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> that this issue {{would be on the}} agenda. This proposal was treated in a routine manner during the meeting and was approved unanimously without debate.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, the Twins {{assembled}} a 130-member advisory group, dubbed Minnesotans for Major League Baseball, which met to discuss possible stadium alternatives. Their deliberations included {{a meeting with}} Bud Selig, commissioner of baseball, to discuss economic issues within the sport. Their final report did not recommend a site (and did not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> Rapid Park), but did provide advice to the team on how to proceed in winning public approval for any plan.|$|E
25|$|During the war, the Luftwaffe {{consistently}} {{underestimated the}} value of the system. A 16 July 1940 Luftwaffe intelligence report failed to <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> it, in spite of being aware of it through signals intercepts, and having complete details of its World War I predecessor. A later report on 7 August did make mention of the system, but only to suggest that it would tie fighters to their sectors, reducing their flexibility and ability to deal with large raids.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel {{appended}} 32 {{names of}} soldiers he recommended for awards {{that had been}} ignored. Two New Zealanders recommended for a Bar to their Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) were not <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> in despatches and an outstanding Australian regimental commander recommended for the CMG was also not <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> in despatches, while a brigade commander and a staff officer Chauvel recommended for DSOs received mentions.|$|R

25|$|In both {{legend and}} mythology, Favism {{has been known}} since antiquity. The priests of various Greco-Roman era cults were {{forbidden}} to eat or <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> beans, and Pythagoras had a strict rule that to join {{the society of the}} Pythagoreans one had to swear off beans. This ban was supposedly because beans resembled male genitalia, but it is possible that this was because of a belief that beans and humans were created from the same material.|$|E
25|$|This evaluation, {{combined}} with {{the failure of a}} mission of LZ-130 to detect British radars in August 1939, appears to have led to a general underestimation of the usefulness of the British radar systems. In spite of being aware of Chain Home, German reports {{on the state of the}} Royal Air Force written just before the Battle of Britain did not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> radar at all. Other reports mention it, but do not consider it to be very important. Other sections of the Luftwaffe appear to be dismissive of the system as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The 60th (2/2nd London) Division {{was sent}} to Salonika in December. Milne was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 1 January 1917. On 3 January 1917 Milne arrived at the Rome Conference independently of the French General Sarrail. The official French record of the Rome Conference did not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> Milne as a participant. As {{a result of the}} Conference Milne was placed under Sarrail's command, with right of appeal to his own government – who overruled him when he protested against Sarrail's movement of a British brigade outside the British zone. This precedent was much discussed {{in the next few months}} when David Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, attempted to place the BEF on the Western Front under General Robert Nivelle.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2003 season, the AFL {{made a deal}} with NBC to {{televise}} league games, which was renewed for another two years in 2005. In conjunction with this, the league moved {{the beginning of the season}} from May to February (the week after the NFL's Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday instead of Friday or Saturday as it had in the past. In 2006, because of the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Daytona 500, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on June 30, 2006, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal. Las Vegas owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a deal failed is because ESPN refused to show highlights or <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> a product being broadcast on NBC.|$|E
25|$|Galois' {{theory was}} {{notoriously}} difficult for his contemporaries to understand, {{especially to the}} level where they could expand on it. For example, in his 1846 commentary, Liouville completely missed the group-theoretic core of Galois' method. Joseph Alfred Serret who attended some of Liouville's talks, included Galois' theory in his 1866 (third edition) of his textbook Cours d'algèbre supérieure. Serret's pupil, Camille Jordan, had an even better understanding reflected in his 1870 book Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques. Outside France, Galois' theory remained more obscure for a longer period. In Britain, Cayley failed to grasp its depth and popular British algebra textbooks didn't <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> Galois' theory until well {{after the turn of}} the century. In Germany, Kronecker's writings focused more on Abel's result. Dedekind wrote little about Galois' theory, but lectured on it at Göttingen in 1858, showing a very good understanding. Eugen Netto's books of the 1880s, based on Jordan's Traité, made Galois theory accessible to a wider German and American audience as did Heinrich Martin Weber's highly influential 1895 algebra textbook.|$|E
500|$|By the 1940s, {{most artists}} {{had given up}} on the genre. [...] The most devoted practitioners, Masereel and Ward, moved on to other work for which they became better known; Masereel's {{obituary}} did not <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> his wordless novels. [...] Many wordless novels remained out of print until the rise of the graphic novel revived interest amongst readers and publishers in the early 21st century.|$|E

500|$|The CAB {{concluded}} that the accident was due to [...] "the pilot's unwise decision {{to embark on a}} flight" [...] that required instrument flying skills he had not proved to have. A contributing factor was the pilot's unfamiliarity with the old-style attitude gyroscope fitted on board the aircraft, which may have caused him to believe that he was climbing when he was in fact descending (an example of spatial disorientation). Another contributing factor was the [...] "seriously [...] inadequate" [...] weather briefing provided to the pilot, which [...] "failed to <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> adverse flying condition which should have been highlighted".|$|E
500|$|Another of Ghent's {{criticisms of}} the Wooden Leg {{narrative}} concerns {{the manner of the}} death of Tom Custer, brother of Colonel Custer, at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Ghent's reasons for disbelieving are not made clear, other than that the source is an Indian. Wooden Leg describes a decapitated body with [...] "paint markings" [...] in the skin. From the detailed description of these tattoos, and the buckskin clothing, Marquis identifies the body as Tom Custer. This criticism {{does not seem to have}} been taken up by other scholars. Tom Custer's biography describes the decapitation and the identification from tattoos as facts without further comment. Liberty discusses the controversies surrounding Marquis in great detail, but fails to <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> Tom Custer.|$|E
500|$|General Archibald Wavell, the {{commander}} of British Army forces in the Middle East, when in Greece from 11–13 April had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised Major General Freddie de Guingand to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers. Nevertheless, the British could not at this stage adopt or <b>even</b> <b>mention</b> this course of action; the suggestion had {{to come from the}} Greek Government. The following day, Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force be withdrawn. [...] Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April, Rear admiral H. T. Baillie-Grohman was sent to Greece to prepare for the evacuation. [...] That day Wilson hastened to Athens where he attended a conference with the King, Papagos, d'Albiac and Rear admiral Turle. In the evening, after telling the King that he felt he had failed him in the task entrusted to him, Prime Minister Koryzis committed suicide. [...] On 21 April, the final decision to evacuate Empire forces to Crete and Egypt was taken and Wavell—in confirmation of verbal instructions—sent his written orders to Wilson.|$|E
