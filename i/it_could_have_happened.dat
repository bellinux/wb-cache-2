[...] Harris's handling of the tragedy was also criticized, as he initially attempted to place {{some of the blame}} on previous Liberal and NDP governments. Harris called a public inquiry, headed by Justice Dennis O'Connor, which later noted that in addition to Stan Koebel's failure to properly monitor and treat the water supply, deregulation of water quality testing and cuts to the Ministry of the Environment were contributing factors. The inquest into the tragedy found that the government cuts to inspection services and their privatisation had created a situation in which future water safety could not be guaranteed. [...] The Ontario government was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place.|$|E

60|$|That {{afternoon}} Old Pipes, {{feeling very}} sad that his plan {{in regard to}} his mother had failed, sat down upon the rock and played upon his pipes. The pleasant sounds went down the valley and up the hills and mountain, but, to the great surprise of some persons who happened to notice the fact, the notes were not echoed back from the rocky hillside, but from the woods {{on the side of}} the valley on which Old Pipes lived. The next day many of the villagers stopped in their work to listen to the echo of the pipes coming from the woods. The sound was not as clear and strong as it used to be when it was sent back from the rocky hillside, but it certainly came from among the trees. Such a thing as an echo changing its place in this way had never been heard of before, and nobody was able to explain how <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> Old Pipes, however, knew very well that the sound came from the Echo-dwarf shut up in the great oak-tree. The sides of the tree were thin, and the sound of the pipes could be heard through them, and the dwarf was obliged by the laws of his being to echo back those notes whenever they came to him. But Old Pipes thought he might get the Dryad in trouble if he let any one know that the Echo-dwarf was shut up in the tree, and so he wisely said nothing about it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{opinion of}} Mr. Max Muller has always {{a right to}} the first hearing from English inquirers. Mr. Muller, naturally, {{examines}} first {{the name of the}} god whose legend he is investigating. He writes: 'There is no such being as Kronos in Sanskrit. Kronos did not exist till long after Zeus in Greece. Zeus was called by the Greeks the son of Time ([Greek]). This is a very simple and very common form of mythological expression. It meant originally, not that time was the origin or source of Zeus, but [Greek] or [Greek] was used in the sense of [...] "connected with time, representing time, existing through all time." [...] Derivatives in -[Greek] and -[Greek] took, in later times, the more exclusive meaning of patronymics. [...] . When this (the meaning of [Greek] as equivalent to Ancient of Days) ceased to be understood, [...] . people asked themselves the question, Why is Zeus called [Greek]?
