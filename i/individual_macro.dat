The closed access results demonstrate that while the system sum capacity initially increases with the density of femto cells, this gain comes with a significant performance penalty suffered by an <b>individual</b> <b>macro</b> user. In open access mode, we show via analytical derivations that macro users only benefit from access to the available femto base stations for impractically high densities.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a {{synthesis}} technique targeted toward coarse-grained, antifuse-based FPGAs. A macro logic cell, in this class of FPGAs, has multiple inputs and multiple outputs. A library of small logic cells can be generated from this macro cell, and used to map the target netlist. First, we calculate the minimum number of macro logic cells required to map a given circuit by using either a dynamic programming or a linear programming technique. Given this minimum number of macro logic cells, we introduce an interconnect-aware clustering algorithm that assigns logic cells to <b>individual</b> <b>macro</b> cells so as to minimize the routing costs. Alternatively, a timing slack-driven clustering algorithm is presented where timing criticalities of nodes in a network are calculated and {{used to determine the}} final packing into the macro cells so as to minimize the number of the macro cells on the critical paths. When compared to results from a commercial tool, our two synthesis techniques reduce the number of macro logic cells by 12 %, and the maximum depth by 35 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{observed}} general time-asymmetric {{behavior of}} macroscopic systems [...] {{embodied in the}} second law of thermodynamics [...] arises naturally from time-symmetric microscopic laws due to the great disparity between macro and micro-scales. More specific features of macroscopic evolution depend {{on the nature of}} the microscopic dynamics. In particular, short range interactions with good mixing properties lead, for simple systems, to the quantitative description of such evolutions by means of autonomous hydrodynamic equations, e. g., the diffusion equation. These deterministic time-asymmetric equations accurately describe the observed behavior of <b>individual</b> <b>macro</b> systems. Derivations using ensembles (or probability distributions) must therefore, to be relevant, hold for almost all members of the ensemble, i. e., occur with probability close to one. Equating observed irreversible macroscopic behavior with the time evolution of ensembles describing systems having only a few degrees of freedom, where no such typicality holds, is misguided and misleading.

40|$|Many complex domains {{and even}} larger {{problems}} in simple domains remain challenging {{in spite of}} the recent progress in planning. Besides developing and improving planning technologies, re-engineering a domain by utilising acquired knowledge opens up a potential avenue for further research. Moreover, macro-actions, when added to the domain as additional actions, provide a promising means by which to convey such knowledge. A macro-action, or macro in short, is a group of actions selected for application as a single choice. Most existing work on macros exploits properties explicitly specific to the planners or the domains. However, such properties {{are not likely to be}} common with arbitrary planners or domains. Therefore, a macro learning method that does not exploit any structural knowledge about planners or domains explicitly is of immense interest. This paper presents an offline macro learning method that works with arbitrarily chosen planners and domains. Given a planner, a domain, and a number of example problems, the learning method generates macros from plans of some of the given problems under the guidance of a genetic algorithm. It represents macros like regular actions, evaluates them individually by solving the remaining given problems, and suggests <b>individual</b> <b>macros</b> that are to be added to the domain permanently. Genetic algorithms are automatic learning methods that can capture inherent features of a system using no explicit knowledge about it. Our method thus does not strive to discover or utilise any structural properties specific to a planner or a domain...|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 {{begins by}} {{outlining}} developmental concepts which underpin transition themes, in particular {{those associated with}} the theories of Jean Piaget and other ‘stage’ theorists. Their ideas are highlighted early on because so much transitions research builds on or reacts to core developmental assumptions. Chapter 1 then introduces socio-cultural perspectives on early childhood transitions. These are distinguished by their focus on how children learn by interacting with their immediate socio-cultural environments (e. g., caregivers, peers). This emphasis has been elaborated by several disciplines within {{the social sciences and}} is increasingly mirrored in early child development programmes around the world. Chapter 2 examines the different ways in which transitions are structured, drawing attention to varying logics that can be employed to mark transitions in early childhood. Institutional settings often use biological age as the criterion for readiness. By contrast, sociocultural transitions are often marked through rites of passage, following the cultural and economic reasoning of a given community. Also, around the world children engage in horizontal transitions as they move between different domains of everyday life. Chapter 3 shifts to perspectives on transitions that are informed by systems theories. These are distinguished from socio-cultural approaches by their greater emphasis on the links between <b>individuals,</b> <b>macro</b> social processes and historical changes. These approaches highlight the linkages between children, their communities and global societies and draw attention to the importance of comprehensive programmes that enable children to engage critically with the demands of a changing environment. Chapter 4 focuses on children’s active roles in shaping their transition experiences, with particular attention to the significance of peer group relationships as a moderating influence on transitions. The section then explores research methods that may enable the implementation of children’s right to participation within research and programming in this area.
