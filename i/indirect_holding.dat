5000|$|The <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system (also multi-tiered holding system) is {{a system}} of {{securities}} clearance, settlement and ownership system where ownership information is held electronically as a book entry.

5000|$|Because {{of these}} disadvantages, the [...] "direct holding system" [...] has been {{replaced}} by the <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system. Settlement by physical delivery of certificates worked adequately until the 1960s, when a sharp increase in trading volumes overwhelmed the system. The amount of paper that physically had to be moved around led to the famous [...] "paperwork crisis" [...] on Wall Street in the late 1960s. This provided the impetus for the introduction of the indirect or multi-tiered holding system.|$|E

50|$|In most jurisdictions {{around the}} world, neither the {{substantive}} laws governing securities transactions nor {{the conflict of}} laws rules determining the law applicable to cross-border transactions have been updated adequately {{to deal with the}} <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system. The concept of direct property right, the basic legal model of ownership of the direct holding of securities, is difficult to apply in the indirect system. Under traditional legal principles commingling fungible property terminates direct property rights of owners of the individual commingled items.|$|E
5000|$|The Convention {{is largely}} a {{response}} to the move in recent times in most nations from a purely direct holding system to a mixed direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system.

The development of a global agreed-upon method of determining the legal regime governing any such transactions lagged behind market practice, leaving financial markets with significant legal risk.|$|E
5000|$|In {{finance and}} {{financial}} law, dematerialization {{refers to the}} substitution of paper-form securities by book-entry securities.

[...] In 1970 the CCS service was extended to the American Stock Exchange. This {{led to the development of}} the Banking and Securities Industry Committee (BASIC), which represented leading U.S. banks and securities exchanges, and was headed by a banker named Herman Beavis, and finally the development of DTC in 1973, which was headed by Bill Dentzer, the former New York State Banking Superintendent. All the top New York banks were represented on the board, usually by their chairman. BASIC and the SEC saw this <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system as a [...] "temporary measure", on the way to a [...] "certificateless society".|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{financial}} market technologies and {{methods such as}} depositories and securities held in electronic form, securities settlement involved the physical movement of paper instruments, or certificates and transfer forms. Payment was usually made by paper check upon receipt by the registrar or transfer agent of properly negotiated certificates and other requisite documents. Physical settlement securities still exist in modern markets today mostly for private (restricted or unregistered) securities {{as opposed to those}} of publicly (exchange) traded securities; however, payment of money today is typically made via electronic funds transfer (in the U.S., a bank wire transfer made through the Federal Reserve's Fedwire system). Physical/paper settlement involves higher risks, inasmuch as paper instruments, certificates, and transfer forms are subject to risks electronic media are not, such as loss, theft, clerical errors, and forgery (see <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system).|$|E
50|$|Under the <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system, {{securities}} {{are held}} through fungible accounts (omnibus accounts). Under such a system, {{there is no}} record of an individual investor's interest in respect of the securities {{at the level of the}} issuer's or intermediary's register, other than the intermediary with whom the investor has a direct relationship. Thus, if the investor, or a person such as a collateral taker asserting a claim against the investor's interest were to try to enforce that claim at any of these higher levels, the response would be that no record exists of any interest against which the claim could be pursued. This problem demonstrates that any attempt to apply the look-through approach under a fungible custody structure runs counter to the widespread conflict of laws principle that jurisdiction over proprietary aspects of dispositions of movable property should broadly be attributed to the jurisdiction where orders in respect of that property are capable of being enforced.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} methods of moxibustion. Three {{of them are}} direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and {{indirect}} moxibustion. Direct scarring moxibustion places a small cone of moxa on the skin at an acupuncture point and burns it until the skin blisters, which then scars after it heals. Direct non-scarring moxibustion removes the burning moxa before the skin burns enough to scar, unless the burning moxa is left on the skin too long. <b>Indirect</b> moxibustion <b>holds</b> a cigar made of moxa near the acupuncture point to heat the skin, or holds it on an acupuncture needle inserted in the skin to heat the needle. There is also stick-on moxa.|$|R
40|$|Indirect realists {{maintain}} that our {{perceptions of the}} external world are mediated by our ‘perceptions’ of subjective intermediaries such as sensations. Multiple reference occurs when a word or an instance of {{it has more than}} one reference. I argue that, because <b>indirect</b> realists <b>hold</b> that speakers typically and unknowingly directly perceive something subjective and indirectly perceive something objective, the phenomenon of multiple reference is an important resource for their view. In particular, a challenge that A. D. Smith has recently put forward for indirect realists can be overcome by appreciating how multiple reference is likely to arise when a projectivist variety of indirect realism is interpreted by speakers adhering to a naïve direct realism...|$|R
50|$|Idealists {{maintain}} a {{skepticism about the}} physical world, arguing either: 1) that nothing exists outside the mind, or 2) {{that we would have}} no access to a mind-independent reality, even if it exists. The latter case often {{takes the form of a}} denial of the idea that we can have 'unconceptualised' experiences (see Myth of the Given). Conversely, most realists (specifically, <b>indirect</b> realists) <b>hold</b> that perceptions or sense data are caused by mind-independent objects. But this introduces the possibility of another kind of skepticism: since our understanding of causality is that the same effect can be produced by multiple causes, there is a lack of determinacy about what one is really perceiving, as in the brain in a vat scenario.|$|R

40|$|Canadian federal {{corporate}} legislation contemplates that shares will {{be transferred}} by endorsement of paper share certificates. These provisions, now {{found in the}} Canada Business Corporations Act Part VII, were enacted in the mid- 1970 s to reflect the then current market practices. However, {{for the last two}} decades, the overwhelmingly prevalent commercial practice is to transfer shares by book entries without using paper certificates - such transfers taking place in what is called the <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system. Despite the domination of the <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system, until recently, there have been no legislative provisions addressing this method of transferring securities. Recent specific provincial legislation has addressed this practice by removing responsibility for securities transfers from provincial corporate legislation and placing it within legislation that deals exclusively with securities transfers. However, Canadian federal legislation has yet to respond to the ubiquitous <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system for federal corporations. This paper examines the case law history regarding the current CBCA part VII provisions and outlines the current prevailing methods of transferring securities. It then compares the operation of the CBCA Part VII provisions to general corporate law rationales. The impact of provincial securities legislation on the CBCA is evaluated and future of the CBCA Part VII provisions is analyzed focusing on efficiency concerns. Finally, responses by the Canadian federal government are evaluated and two possible solutions are offered as rational and efficient responses under the current circumstances...|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1867 as an {{operator}} of wharves and warehouses on the south bank of the River Thames. The name {{can be traced to}} Alexander Hay, who acquired a brewhouse there in 1651. It was redeveloped as a 'wharf', in fact an enclosed dock, in 1856 and renamed Hay's Wharf. It was rebuilt after the Great Fire of Southwark in 1861 and still stands; it was converted in the 1980s into a shopping and restaurant area known as Hay's Galleria. The Kuwait Investment Authority acquired an <b>indirect</b> 34% <b>holding</b> in the Company in 1975, increased to 100% in 1980, chiefly to acquire the property assets on the south bank of the Thames, which were sold to St Martins Property Group in the early 1980s.|$|R

40|$|Over the centuries, English law has {{developed}} a ‘flexible’ and ‘malleable’ idea of property - in particular through the rules of equity - which has proved capable of adapting to the continuing changes in market practice. The question now to be addressed is whether this ‘flexible’ idea of property can also adequately represent interests in indirectly held securities or whether (as suggested by the Financial Market Law Committee) the new financial practice requires statutory clarification. Unlike most civil law systems, English law {{has been able to}} accommodate many new issues arising from the practice of intermediated securities within the existing framework. For example, the complex <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> structure is built on the well-developed institution of trust and sub-trust which allows investors to obtain equitable proprietary rights in the assets held for them by the intermediary. The proprietary characterisation of these types of rights has recently been challenged by McFarlane and Stevens, {{on the grounds that they}} seem to establish the same level of protection against third parties, by classifying the investors’ rights as ‘persistent rights’ or ‘rights against rights’. The main advantage of using the concept of a persistent right (rather than a proprietary right) is that it provides a better understanding of the legal structure of intermediation, as well as showing that no statutory clarification is necessary within the United Kingdom. The thesis tests the theoretical foundation of McFarlane and Stevens’ argument, using the current Lehman insolvencies as a platform for evaluation. The primary objective is to consider whether the idea of ‘persistent rights’ or ‘rights against rights’ is better able to explain the precise functions of this new practice and overcome the legal uncertainties typically associated with the <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. This chapter uses comparative law analysis to examine the systems and processes of post-trading infrastructure-clearing and settlement – in the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Its purpose is to identify {{the differences in the}} operating models, the governance, and the regulatory thinking behind them. Taiwan clearly shows its cautious approach to post-trading infrastructure which is evidenced in its vertical silo system and in its direct and transparency holding system. However, Taiwan does not provide clear legal rules dealing with insolvency risk and settlement finality. It is also not clear why Taiwan does not follow the “Place of Relevant Intermediary Approach” (hereinafter “PRIMA”). It is argued that Taiwan can learn from the United Kingdom non-vertical silo model to increase innovation. Taiwan could also adopt the trust and non-transparency <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> system to increase investor protection and settlement finality to increase legal certainty...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a book}} on {{comparative}} law and legal change. With a focus on corporate law and the law of personal property, it reviews {{the current state of}} the comparative debate on the evolution of law and seeks to establish new perspectives to explain the mechanism of legal reception. It finds the comparative discussions centred on the appropriateness of describing the movement of law from one country to another in terms of ‘legal transplants’ perplexing and lacking in a convincing inquiry into the reception process. In an attempt to fill that gap, this study contends that certain recent contributions on culture contact and culture change provide an interesting explanation for the circulation of juridical models across national boundaries. More precisely, this study argues that the notion of hybridity, as originated in postcolonial theory, offers a formidable conceptual means to examine the intricacies of legal evolution, to refine and to give content to the observation of the reception of law. The analysis in comparative jurisprudence put forward in this book does not rest exclusively on theoretical grounds. The complexities of the themes involved are explored and tested by focusing on a case study. This is the legal mechanism by which shares in companies are transferred in England under the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>holding</b> systems. </p...|$|E

The Press Law, which entered into force in 1989 and is largely based on Colonial British Law, is outdated and inoperative in many respects. Under the Press Law, print media are not obliged to disclose any crucial information concerning ownership, such as shareholders, beneficial owners or information on people <b>holding</b> <b>indirect</b> interests in the media outlet.|$|R

In 1861 the tax was reduced to ninepence (£0–0s–9d), in 1863 to sevenpence, in 1864 to fivepence and in 1865 to fourpence. Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers' money and so sought to let money [...] "fructify in the pockets of the people" [...] by keeping taxation levels down through [...] "peace and retrenchment". [...] In 1859 he wrote to his brother, who was a member of the Financial Reform Association at Liverpool: [...] "Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I understand it) in my financial creed. [...] The controversy between direct and <b>indirect</b> taxation <b>holds</b> a minor, though important place". He wrote to his wife on 14 January 1860: [...] "I am certain, from experience, of the immense advantage of strict account-keeping in early life.
