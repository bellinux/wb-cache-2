5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally less effective, {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar camouflage. However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Rheinland refueled and re-armed. Meanwhile, her three sisters stood out in the roadstead in defensive positions. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired thirty-five 28cm (11in) shells and twenty-six 15cm (5.9in) rounds. The two <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> Black Prince had killed 10 men and wounded 20. Repair work followed immediately in Wilhelmshaven and was completed by 10 June.|$|E

She escaped from the crossfire by crossing ahead of San Francisco and passing to the disengaged side of Scott's column. Duncan—still engaged in her solitary torpedo attack on the Japanese formation—was also hit by gunfire from both sides, set afire, and looped away in her own effort to escape the crossfire.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 John Sykes {{decided to}} reactivate Thin Lizzy, {{presenting}} the band {{as a tribute}} to Phil Lynott's life and work. He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E
5|$|The Landlord, {{the leader}} of Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a Hong Kong Film Award-winning comedic actor who starred in various box office <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> 1970s to 1990s before emigrating to Canada shortly before the {{handover}} of Hong Kong. Hui was chosen for the part {{because he is the}} ideal actor to play a character who persuades others to do bad things. The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang.|$|E

5|$|A {{second wave}} of German {{aircraft}} arrived over Belgrade at 10:00 and the remaining IK-3s were scrambled {{with the rest of}} the 51st Fighter Group but the IK-3 pilots claimed no victories. A joint claim was made during the third German attack at 14:00, a twin-engined bomber by Gogić and another pilot from the 162nd Fighter Squadron. The following day, the IK-3 pilots made five or six sorties against German bomber formations and their fighter escorts and claimed three bombers between them. At 17:00, Milislav Semiz attacked a tight formation of three bombers; his aircraft received 56 <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> return fire, 20 of which were in the engine and propeller, but managed to land the aircraft. The return of another IK-3 from the workshops meant that the number of serviceable IK-3s remained at three.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Resurrection was {{originally}} {{set for a}} Christmas 2004 release. However, Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games before the release for trademark and copyright infringement. Faced with a threat of legal action, the project was publicly closed on September 6, 2004. According to the development team, the website of the project had received significant <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> Square Enix Japanese IP addresses {{for a period of}} three months before the letter issuing. They assumed these visits were mostly from employees rather than top executives, and hoped the company would see the demo as how the team sees it, a tribute to Chrono Trigger rather than a replacement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of World War II, Colorado {{undertook}} a defensive patrol near the Golden Gate Bridge in May 1942 to stop a possible Japanese invasion. She then sailed to Fiji to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. On 24 July 1944, during the shelling of Tinian, Colorado received 22 shell <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August. She later arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 November 1944 to support American troops fighting ashore. On 27 November, she was hit by two Kamikazes which caused moderate damage.|$|E

5|$|She joined {{other units}} {{going for the}} Mariana Islands at the harbor at San Francisco. She {{departed}} on 5 May passing Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein to the pre-invasion shelling at Saipan, Guam, and Tinian after 14 June. During the shelling of Tinian on 24 July she was damaged, 43 men were killed, and 198 wounded by 22 shell <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> Japanese shore batteries; she continued shelling the island and providing fire support for the invasion troops. After undergoing extensive repairs along the West Coast, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to begin the invasion of Leyte. A week after her arrival she was struck by two kamikaze suicide bombers, which killed 19 crewmembers, injured 72, and moderately damaged the ship. Despite the damage, she bombarded Mindoro on schedule from 12 to 17 January 1945. She then proceeded to Manus Island for urgent repairs.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E

5|$|The ship damaged her {{propellers}} on 27 May and {{was under}} repairs at Chatham Dockyard until 4 June, {{when she was}} transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She sailed for Le Havre, France on 9 June, to assist in the evacuation of British troops before advancing German troops (Operation Cycle). The next afternoon, she was severely damaged by three <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> German aircraft that knocked out her steering gear. Bulldogs crew was able to temporarily repair the steering gear and the ship reached Portsmouth Dockyard early the following morning. Whilst under repair, she was further damaged by splinters during an air raid on 24 August. Bulldog rejoined the flotilla after her repairs were completed on 2 September.|$|E

5|$|With the {{departure}} of team captain Spencer Machacek to the professional ranks the following season, Blum was chosen in his place for the 2008–09 season. He began the season with 14 points in his first 10 games and was named WHL Player of the Month for September/October. On November 19, 2008, he recorded his first career WHL hat trick in a 4–1 win against the Chilliwack Bruins. Later that season, on February 7, 2009, during a 4–2 victory over the Portland Winter Hawks, Blum became the Giants' all-time assists leader with his 148th assist to pass Adam Courchaine's 147-assists mark. Nearly a week later, however, he was sidelined with a shoulder injury after receiving a couple of <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> Kelowna Rockets forward Jamie Benn in a 3–2 overtime loss.|$|E

5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, {{the islands}} of Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every six to seven years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned in mid-1942, Musashi was {{modified}} {{to serve as}} the flagship of the Combined Fleet, and {{spent the rest of the}} year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. She was present during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Over half of her crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and his team of researchers.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by <b>hits</b> <b>from</b> 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E
