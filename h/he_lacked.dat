He {{maintained}} a deferential {{attitude towards the}} older, seniority-laden Southern members when he first entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues. Compared to his brothers in office, <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> John's sophistication and Robert's intense, sometimes grating drive, but was more affable than either of them.|$|E

They were usually {{completed}} in series, {{such as those}} painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when {{he was reluctant to}} mix with others, or when <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> models, and so painted himself.|$|E

Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, Swift felt that <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E

5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} {{of drums}} that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills.

His debut for Hull was as a late substitute in a 2–0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion on 20 August 2005. Though <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> fitness {{at the start of the}} season, injuries to Keith Andrews and Ian Ashbee gave him the chance of a regular starting place, and manager Taylor also handed him the team captaincy.|$|E

Although the economy was booming in the region, the {{business}} struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the ACLU {{board of}} {{directors}} asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization.

5|$|Leonardo's {{approach}} to science was observational: {{he tried to}} understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. In the 1490s he studied mathematics under Luca Pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book De divina proportione, published in 1509.|$|E
5|$|Modi {{spent the}} ensuing two years {{travelling}} across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details {{of where he}} went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained {{only a short time}} at each, since <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> the required college education. Vivekananda {{has been described as a}} large influence in Modi's life.|$|E
5|$|The Senate convened on 18 September, to {{validate}} Tiberius's position as Princeps and, {{as it had}} done with Augustus before, extend {{the powers of the}} position to him.

5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E

Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> Black's insight and had to commit the crimes {{in order to see}} {{through the eyes of a}} killer.|$|E
