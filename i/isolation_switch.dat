The ohmic switch shows a low intrinsic loss of 0. 1 dB and an isolation of 24. 8 dB at 6 GHz. The measured average pull-in voltage is 28 V and switching time is 47 µs.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a novel high <b>isolation</b> <b>switch</b> was {{designed}} and optimized on high-resistance silicon substrate with all-metal beams. The RF MEMS switch was modeled with gold surface micro-fabrication process. To obtain a low actuation voltage and a better isolation, a folded structure in the shunt part of the switch and a short capacitance in the series part were designed, respectively. By combining the series and shunt switches, the mixed one offered a wide range (DC- 40 GHz) with excellent isolation better than- 35 dB and insertion loss less than 0. 72 dB at the same range, making it promising for applications with wide frequency bands.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical comparison between a static-CMOS and a hybrid-RERL design of an inverter. The measurements {{taken into account}} are the total power dissipation, the performance in terms of propagation delay, {{and the size of}} each design. The hybrid-RERL architecture uses the RERL format except it reduces the 6 -phase clock presented in earlier papers to a 5 -phase clock by replacing the <b>isolation</b> <b>switch</b> on the output of the logic function with a non-gated, isolating device (i. e. a diode). Still, the hybrid-RERL logic makes further use of reversible logic. Although, the idea behind reversible logic (and adiabatic circuits) is to eliminate all non-adiabatic losses, this paper places a secondary goal of simplifying the hybrid-RERL inverter, which results in some non-adiabatic loss. Overall, the hybrid-RERL inverter significantly reduces power consumption at the cost of complexity and performance. As personal computers become more compact and portable (e. g. laptops, PDA’s, cell phones, etc.), power consumption becomes a larger factor. Although the energy dissipation from digital devices has declined over the last 50 years, it is expected that this tread line will slow down and/or stop within the next decade or two [3].

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{equipment}} design features can {{have a profound effect on}} the working life of a frying oil, and consequently on secure/safe operation of the industrial deep-frying at high temperatures. The design aspects of the cooker should eliminate known factors of heat degradation/oxidation in the frying oil while maintaining outputs of products of consistent quality. For instance, the pro-oxidant catalyst copper or brass valves/fittings must not be employed. Continuous removal of debris/sediment and the maintenance of uniform oil temperatures leads to the development of FFAs at a lower rate, better taste, colour and appearance of the product. Security thermostats are fitted to each heating element in many modern, small-scale catering fryers. These are designed to trip out if the primary thermostat fails to function. Also the current <b>isolation</b> <b>switch</b> cuts off the electrical supply if the element head is not placed correctly in the fryer. In both catering and industrial frying operations, smoke haze can be a problem. The volatile break-down products such as FFAs, etc. formed in the oil being heated at high temperatures give rise to smoke, which if not controlled can enhance fire hazards due to their lower flash point. The smoke point is of most benefit in assessing the quality of a frying oil, since it is mainly the FFAs produced in the frying operation which contribute to the smoke haze. Commercial frying oils as well as the entire frying installation including cooker design, must meet strict quality and safety requirements. These features become extremely important, especially in the industrial flash frying operation when the frying oil is heated to a higher temperature of 200 °G. High oil quality and high smoke/flash point frying oils are essential characteristics of the flash frying operation. These days, two important features namely carbon dioxide blanketing system and a waste air cleaning system have become standard design items for secure and environmental friendly operation of multi-purpose industrial fryers. This paper will highlight various safety and design features of many modern, industrial frying operations...|$|E

40|$|Recent space {{experience}} {{has shown that}} the use of commercial optocouplers can be problematic in spacecraft, such as TOPEX/Poseidon, that must operate in significant radiation environments. Radiation [...] induced failures of these devices have been observed in space and have been further documented at similar radiation doses in the laboratory. The ubiquitous use of optocouplers in spacecraft systems for a variety of applications, such as electrical <b>isolation,</b> <b>switching</b> and power transfer, is indicative of the need for optocouplers that can withstand the space radiation environment. In addition, the distributed nature of their use implies that it is not particularly desirable to shield optocouplers for use in radiation environments. Thus, it will be important for the space community to have access to radiation hardened/tolerant optocouplers. For many microelectronic and photonic devices, it is difficult to achieve radiation hardness without sacrificing performance. However, in the case of optocouplers, one should be able to achieve both superior radiation hardness and performance for such characteristics as switching speed, current transfer ratio (CTR), minimum power usage and array power transfer, if standard light emitting diodes (LEDs), such as those in the commercial optocouplers mentioned above, are avoided, and VCSELs are employed as the emitter portion of the optocoupler. The physical configuration of VCSELs allows one to achieve parallel use of an array of devices and construct a multichannel optocoupler in the standard fashion with the emitters and detectors looking at each other. In addition, detectors similar in structure to the VCSELs can be fabricated which allows bidirectional functionality of the optocoupler.
