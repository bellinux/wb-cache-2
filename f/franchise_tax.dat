Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California <b>Franchise</b> <b>Tax</b> Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E

25|$|During his tenure, {{the major}} issues facing state {{government}} were related to secondary education and highway construction. With {{the passage of the}} controversial School Codes of 1919 and 1921 Delaware was committed to an aggressive program of school construction. Pierre S. du Pont had agreed to get the process started and provided the massive financial support from his own funds. However, that could not continue forever and yet the General Assembly refused to levy additional taxes. Fortunately the new income tax and corporate <b>franchise</b> <b>tax</b> were capable of producing the revenue needed, but it was suspected everyone was not filing as they should have been. To remedy the situation Robinson appointed du Pont himself to be the State Tax Commissioner. Du Pont quickly modernized the office, increased the revenue from the income tax and assured the continuation of the school building program.|$|E

25|$|As governor, Edge {{obtained}} legislation consolidating state boards, {{improving the}} civil service, imposing a <b>franchise</b> <b>tax</b> on public utilities, allowing greater home rule for cities, reforming corporation law, and improving state institutions, especially the prisons. In 1917 the legislature {{also agreed to}} Edge's proposal to reorganize the state road department, and Edge won approval for legislation authorizing {{the construction of a}} bridge between southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and a tunnel between northern New Jersey and New York City. The bridge had been sought for some time by South Jersey legislators, but had failed to gain the support of North Jersey legislators, who opposed spending state funds on a project that they felt would benefit only {{the southern part of the}} state. Edge therefore combined the bridge proposal with plans for a tunnel to New York to win statewide support. The bridge, the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which spans the Delaware River between Camden and Philadelphia, opened in 1926, and the tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, which connects Jersey City and lower Manhattan, opened in 1927. It has been contended that the decision to place the terminus of the tunnel in Jersey City was the result of Frank Hague’s support of Edge in the 1916 gubernatorial election.|$|E
