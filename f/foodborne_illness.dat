Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
25|$|The main causes were Norovirus, {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., {{although the}} causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates {{to an average of}} approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious <b>foodborne</b> <b>illness.</b> Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to <b>foodborne</b> <b>illness</b> and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to <b>foodborne</b> <b>illness</b> circa 2010.

40|$|Foodborne disease {{outbreaks}} {{have a tremendous}} impact on society, including <b>foodborne</b> <b>illnesses,</b> hospitalizations, lost work time, and deaths. These food-safety events have a significant influence in shaping consumer's perception of risk. In food consumption, outbreaks of <b>foodborne</b> <b>illnesses</b> also {{have an effect on the}} development of public health policy. Due to these safety-related uncertainties in the food supply chain, various regulatory safety and health policies are implemented to decrease potential harm to likely victims. The expected effect of these food-safety policies forecasted in terms of reduction in <b>foodborne</b> <b>illnesses,</b> mortality, and food-related diseases may be overstated if consumer's offsetting behavior is overlooked. Reduction and in some cases reversal of direct policy effect may occur.

25|$|A main aim of {{this study}} was to compare if <b>foodborne</b> <b>illness</b> {{incidence}} had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.|$|E

It predominantly, but not exclusively, affects children. Most cases are preceded by an episode of infectious, sometimes bloody, diarrhea acquired as a <b>foodborne</b> <b>illness</b> or from a contaminated water supply caused by , other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes, Shigella, and Campylobacter. A variety of viruses have also been implicated as a causative agent. It is now {{the most common cause}} of acquired acute renal failure in childhood. It is a medical emergency and carries a 5–10% mortality rate; of the remainder, the majority recover without major consequences, approximately 30% suffer residual renal injury. The primary target appears to be the vascular endothelial cell. This may explain the pathogenesis of HUS, in which a characteristic renal lesion is capillary microangiopathy.|$|E
