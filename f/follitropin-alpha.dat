Developments in recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone preparations and their injection devices have improved patient {{quality of life}} by enabling patients to self-administer treatment at home. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate patient experiences of learning to use and overall satisfaction with the <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (Gonal-f) filled-by-mass (FbM) prefilled pen. Methods This questionnaire-based survey study was conducted in 23 fertility centres in Japan over a period of 14 months. Patients who were receiving fertility treatment with the <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (FbM) prefilled pen were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their satisfaction, ease of learning and use, and injection site pain following treatment. Results A total of 663 women participated in the study. The majority of patients found the instructions for administering <b>follitropin-alpha</b> with the prefilled pen easy to understand (83. 0 %; n = 546 / 658) and patients found that a hands-on demonstration by a nurse or doctor was the most useful tool for learning to use the <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (FbM) prefilled pen (80. 0 %; n = 497 / 621). Forty-eight percent (n = 318) of patients in the study had previous experience with different types of fertility medications and the majority of these patients found the <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (FbM) prefilled pen easier to use (75. 1 %; n = 232 / 309) and less painful (89. 0 %; n = 347 / 390) than their previous medication. The majority (80. 2 %; n = 521 / 650) of patients reported overall satisfaction with the <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (FbM) prefilled pen. Conclusions The <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (FbM) prefilled pen is an easy-to-use injection device according to this questionnaire-based survey. Patients who had experience of different types of fertility medication preferred the <b>follitropin-alpha</b> (FbM) prefilled pen to other injection devices. </p...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{purified}} bovine follitropin was dissociated {{into its}} alpha- and beta-subunits after treatment with 1 M-propionic acid. The dissociated subunits were fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100. The isolated alpha- and beta-subunits were biologically inactive, but their recombinants regenerated 80 % of the follitropin activity. The alpha-subunit of bovine follitropin recombined with the beta-subunits of bovine lutropin and thyrotropin to regenerate 70 % of lutropin and 50 % of thyrotropin activities respectively. The beta-subunit of bovine follitropin recombined with the alpha-subunit of either bovine lutropin or thyrotropin to regenerate about 75 % of follitropin activity. Recombinations were monitored by specific radioligand-receptor assays and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The elution {{volumes of the}} alpha- and beta-subunits of bovine follitropin after gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 were almost identical. The amino acid composition of bovine <b>follitropin-alpha</b> was low in histidine, arginine, isoleucine and leucine, but relatively high in lysine, threonine and glutamic acid. The bovine follitropin-beta contained one methionine residue and low amounts of histidine and phenylalanine, but relatively high in aspartic acid, threonine and glutamic acid. The N-terminal residues of the alpha- and beta-subunits of bovine follitropin were identified to be phenylalanine and glycine respectively...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{administration}} of follitropin-beta with a pen device (Puregon Pen(R)) is more convenient, less painful and 16 - 18 % more efficient. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform an economic evaluation of the administration of follitropin-beta by this pen device against <b>follitropin-alpha</b> by multidose and highly purified (HP) HMG by conventional syringe in IVF treatment by comparing the process utilities and the costs for the Dutch setting. Conjoint analysis assessed the process utilities for the three administration modes on a scale from 0 to 1. A decision analytic model estimated the costs of an average IVF cycle from a societal perspective. Patients estimated the process utility at 0. 96 for the pen, 0. 53 for the multidose and 0. 36 for the conventional syringe. Additional costs were estimated at 0 Euros and 194 Euros, comparing the pen with multidose or conventional methods respectively. Assuming a 16 % efficiency gain of the pen, costs ranged from Euros- 135 (savings) to 60 Euros (extra costs). In conclusion, patients perceive sufficient benefits to the pen device to choose it over other dosing methods. Dominance of the pen device over the multidose method was shown. Compared with the conventional administration method, the added value of the pen device was 2. 7 (0. 96 / 0. 36) times higher...|$|E
