50|$|Popular Electronics (April 1974) {{featured}} a complete keyboard kit designed by Don Lancaster and available from Southwest Technical Products for $39.50. The first version used simple RTL ICs to decode the key matrix. The design was soon improved {{to use a}} full featured <b>keyboard</b> <b>encoder</b> IC.|$|E
5000|$|Owners of the Apple III could {{purchase}} individual III Plus upgrades, {{like the}} clock and interlacing feature, and obtain the newer logic board as a service replacement. A keyboard upgrade kit, dubbed [...] "Apple III Plus upgrade kit" [...] was also made available - which included the keyboard, cover, <b>keyboard</b> <b>encoder</b> ROM, and logo replacements. This upgrade had to be installed by an authorized service technician.|$|E
50|$|The Mega II has the {{built-in}} {{equivalent of the}} IOU and MMU chips, video and keyboard ROMs (with support for other display languages) and likely the <b>keyboard</b> <b>encoder</b> found in the IIe. It also has a built-in keyboard and mouse controller (neither {{were used in the}} Apple IIGS). Potentially the Mega II could have been used to produce future models of the 8-bit Apple II with a very low chip count (and reduced physical size) but instead used for IIe emulation on the Apple IIGS and Macintosh LC with plug-in card. It was also used as support circuity on the Apple II Video Overlay Card.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor’s {{thesis is}} focused on {{developing}} applications for the developing board with microcontroller ATMEL (ATmega 16). Bachelor’s thesis describes the microcontroller including a description of hardware components and control registers. This book describes the various peripherals on the developing kit with programming examples. Simple modules have been created for the developing board, {{which could be used}} to program complex project and easy aplications. On these modules are periphery as matrix <b>keyboard,</b> <b>encoder,</b> real time clock and circuit L 293 D for controling DC motor with PWM signal. The AVR Studio version 4. 18 is described and used here as a programming software. This work should serve as a guide about ATMEL AVR ATmega series for beginning or advanced programmers. Examples of individual programs are a part of this work...|$|E
