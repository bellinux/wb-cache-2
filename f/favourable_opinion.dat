5|$|I have {{a rather}} more <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> of the 'Vestiges' than {{you appear to}} have. I do not {{consider}} it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the instability of}} party identification among eligible Japanese voters, using a seven-wave panel survey covering the period from 1993 to 1996. We found that only {{about a quarter of}} our sample consistently identified with the same parties, suggesting that party identification of eligible Japanese voters is very unstable. We also examined the individual characteristics influencing the stability of party identification and found that membership in religious organizations and <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions</b> toward major pre-existing political parties (the LDP, the CGP and the JSP/SDP) have a stabilizing effect on party identification. On the other hand, <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions</b> toward new parties and minor, pre-existing parties (the JCP and the DSP) have a destabilizing effect on party identification. Furthermore, political dissatisfaction, reformative ideology, and the absence of a belief in voting as a duty have a destabilizing effect on party identification...|$|R

25|$|In 1531, {{primarily}} {{as a result of}} the innovative suggestion of Thomas Cranmer, who thought the King's position in the divorce would be strengthened by obtaining favourable opinions from the various universities in England and abroad, Henry VIII sent Dr. Bell, together with the bishop of Lincoln and Foxe, to deliver a letter that he had personally drafted and to canvass Oxford, for a <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> concerning the King's cause; of which they successfully secured despite the danger, being pelted with stones by the popish opposition, together while overcoming the strong resistance from the junior members of convocation.|$|E
25|$|In June 1990, after a <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> {{from the}} Government's law officers, {{it was decided}} to use the power to issue a general {{limitation}} on local government budgets in all authorities which had been enacted in the Rates Act 1984 but had remained unused until then. This decision removed most local government financial autonomy. This 'universal capping' continued from the 1991–92 financial year until 1998–99; when it was ended the Secretary of State took reserve powers under the Local Government Act 1999 to regulate increases in the Council Tax (which had replaced the Community Charge). The Secretary of State was also allowed to require reduction in individual local authorities' budgets.|$|E
25|$|Having {{formed a}} <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> of trolley buses, the Board {{decided to use}} them on a new line to Richmond. However, it {{realised}} that its troubles with Inter City Motors on the North Beach route would soon be resolved and given the vehicles that would become available, {{an extension of the}} trolley bus system would not be needed. An attempt to cancel the order failed, so the second trolley bus line was opened in 1934 to Marshland Road via Richmond. This enabled trams to be withdrawn from the remaining portion of the North Beach tramline, which followed the same route as the new Richmond trolley bus line.|$|E

25|$|Several studies {{reveal that}} France seems to be, among the Western countries, {{the one where}} Muslims {{integrate}} the best and feel the most for their country. French Muslims also have the most positive opinions about their fellow citizens of different faiths. The study from the Pew Research Center on Integration {{is an example of}} works revealing this typically French phenomenon. In Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region where French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, the vast majority rejects violence and say they are loyal to France according to studies by Euro-Islam, a comparative research network on Islam and Muslims in the West sponsored by GSRL Paris/CNRS France and Harvard University. On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily Le Monde indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A thorough survey by the Pew Research Center in Spring 2014 revealed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

500|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of war with Japan, many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead militia formations and fill important staff posts. One of these was Robertson, who was recalled to take command of the 1st Cavalry Division in January 1942. In March 1942, an unusual event occurred. Major Generals Alan Vasey and Edmund Herring, and Brigadier Clive Steele, fearing that Gordon Bennett or John Lavarack was about to be appointed Commander in Chief, approached the Minister for the Army, Frank Forde, with a proposal that in view of the danger of an invasion of Australia, all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Robertson be appointed Commander in Chief. This reflected an extraordinary endorsement of Robertson by his colleagues, but such <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> was not universally held. Sydney Rowell later explained that: ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Frustration {{continues}} to be directed at delays in gaining approvals for undertaking health research in the UK. We aimed to evaluate the impact of an ethics officer intervention on rates of <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions</b> (approval) and provisional opinions (requiring revision and resubmission) and on the time taken to reach a final opinion by research ethics committees (RECs), to characterise how the role operated in practice, and to investigate applicants' views. DESIGN: Mixed-method study involving (i) a 2 -group, non-randomised before-and-after intervention study of RECs assigned an ethics officer and a matched comparator group; (ii) a process evaluation involving a survey of applicants and documentary analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 6 RECs and 3 associated ethics officers; 18 comparator RECs; REC applicants. RESULTS: Rates of provisional and <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions</b> between ethics officer and comparator RECs did not show a statistically significant effect of the intervention (logistic regression, p= 0. 26 for <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions</b> and p= 0. 31 for provisional opinions). Mean time to reach a decision showed a non-significant reduction (ANOVA, p= 0. 22) from 33. 3 to 32. 0  days in the ethics officer RECs compared with the comparator RECs (32. 6 to 32. 9  days). The survey (30 % response rate) indicated applicant satisfaction and also suggested that ethics officer support might be more useful before submission. Ethics officers were successful in identifying many issues with applications, but the intervention did not function exactly as designed: in 31 % of applicants, no contact between the applicants and the ethics officer took place before REC review. LIMITATIONS: This study was a non-randomised comparison cohort study. Some data were missing. CONCLUSIONS: An ethics officer intervention, as designed and implemented in this study, did not increase the proportion of applications to RECs that were approved on first review and did not reduce the time to a committee decision.

40|$|As an {{institution}} {{with more than}} 25 years experience in flexible delivery education, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) Australia, {{has the ability to}} provide lifelong learning opportunities for students around the world through a range of open and distance education initiatives. Using a 'Hybrid Education' model USQ has recently delivered a resource based learning package on CD to all students in the undergraduate core course, Introduction to Law. The application of flexible learning pedagogies and digital technologies has enabled the benefits of a distributed learning environment to be encapsulated by delivering the CD to on-campus and distance students, in conjunction with student access to interactive teaching support activities online. The use of CD technology has enabled the creation of a technologically enhanced learning experience for all students. The resource rich learning environment includes a combination of learning modules, essential readings, purpose built case law and other data bases, tutorial questions and answers, and lecture style presentations (including video, audio and animated graphics). CD technology enables the delivery of a large volume of learning resources in an economical and interactive way. The use of networked technology means students also have access to just-in-time content delivery via the web, interactive web discussion and telephone conferencing. Initial qualitative and descriptive findings from research undertaken to evaluate this initiative indicate that there is a cohort of students that have very <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions</b> about studying in this new environment provided on the Law CD, however as students needed to modifY their learning approach to use the Law CD, we found that there was also a group that were resistant to changing and thus had less <b>favourable</b> <b>opinions...</b>|$|R
500|$|England won the 1932–33 Ashes series 4–1, but the cricket was {{overshadowed by}} {{controversy}} over the team's use of Bodyline tactics. Leyland was not particularly successful in statistical terms. However, assessing the tour in Wisden, Sydney Southerton wrote that Leyland [...] "fared on the whole extremely well... he had batted finely in the Test matches at Adelaide and Brisbane". He scored 306 runs in the five Test matches {{at an average of}} 34.00; he began and ended the series with scores of 0, but played innings of 83 and 86 in the decisive third and fourth Test matches, with his team under pressure when he batted. Gibson points out that both of his ducks came when England were in dominant positions. In all first-class matches on the tour, Leyland scored 880 runs at 44.00, including two centuries against state teams. The former Australian batsmen Charlie Macartney suggested that, although [...] "a useful player", Leyland was hindered by his defensive approach. Going against his naturally aggressive approach made him seem [...] "awkward", and never allowed him to play at his best. Other Australian commentators had a more <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone became {{concerned}} with the situation of [...] "coal whippers". These were the men who worked on London docks, [...] "whipping" [...] in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea. They were called up and relieved through public-houses and therefore a man could not get this job unless he possessed the <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> of the publican, who looked upon most favourably those who drank. The man's name was written down and the [...] "score" [...] followed. Publicans issued employment solely on {{the capacity of the}} man to pay, and men often left the pub to work drunk. They spent their savings on drink to secure the <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> of publicans and therefore further employment. Gladstone passed the Coal Vendors Act 1843 to set up a central office for employment. When this Act expired in 1856 a Select Committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question. Gladstone gave evidence to the Committee: [...] "I approached the subject in the first instance as I think everyone in Parliament of necessity did, with the strongest possible prejudice against the proposal but the facts stated were of so extraordinary and deplorable a character, {{that it was impossible to}} withhold attention from them. Then the question being whether legislative interference was required I was at length induced to look at a remedy of an extraordinary character as the only one I thought applicable to the case...it was a great innovation". Looking back in 1883, Gladstone wrote that [...] "In principle, perhaps my Coalwhippers Act of 1843 was the most Socialistic measure of the last half century".|$|E

2500|$|Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{offers a}} less <b>favourable</b> <b>opinion</b> of Is This What You Want?, {{describing}} Lomax as [...] "a passable but unarresting singer and songwriter". Unterberger identifies the best moments as the [...] "Beatlesque" [...] songs [...] "Is This What You Want?" [...] and the [...] "uncommonly tender" [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes". Discussing the 2004 reissue in Record Collector, Terry Staunton described Lomax's style as [...] " [...] the same seam as Joe Cocker, albeit {{with a voice}} neither as distinctive or as powerful" [...] and singled out the [...] "gentle balladry" [...] of [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Baby You're A Lover" [...] as highlights. Staunton concluded that Lomax's only Apple album was [...] "a fairly pleasing blue-eyed soul set, which is probably more revered {{today than it was}} 35 years ago". Writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin says that next to the list of celebrated contributors, Lomax's [...] "stylish compositions and superb voice were equal to such esteemed company".|$|E

Another volume, entitled Vigilien (Vigils), followed, and in 1843 he published anonymously a third volume, Schlichte Lieder (Unpretentious Songs) embodying his battle-songs, Lieder eines Hanseaten.
