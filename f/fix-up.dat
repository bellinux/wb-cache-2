500|$|During the chorus, Kiedis sings [...] "Give it away, {{give it away}}, give it away now" [...] {{repeatedly}} over a {{more rapid}} guitar riff before Frusciante provides, according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, a [...] "sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity {{in the form of}} a languid solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track." [...] The solo was recorded in one take because Frusciante had developed a preference towards speedy execution and a raw feeling; according to Flea, [...] "We did very little <b>fix-up</b> stuff. John's philosophy was that he would only play a solo twice. He'd play it once, and if he didn't like it or we didn't like it, he'd play it again—completely different. And that was it." [...] "Give It Away" [...] also makes use of other instruments like the jew's harp, which was played by band friend Pete Weiss. The song continues through several verses and choruses before reaching a bridge that introduces the outro, which consists of [...] "a hard-rocking riff" [...] that, according to Huey, strongly resembles the main riff from Black Sabbath's [...] "Sweet Leaf" [...] from their 1971 record Master of Reality. Kiedis repeats [...] "Give it away now" [...] for several measures before the guitar, bass and drums drop out.|$|E

2500|$|Mazo de la Roche's first {{published}} book, Explorers of the Dawn, appeared in 1922, {{and was a}} <b>fix-up</b> of some previously published sketches, vignettes and stories rewritten to work within an overarching narrative framework. [...] Her first two proper novels, Possession (1923) and Delight (1926), were romantic novels which were mild successes, but nevertheless earned her little in income or recognition.

The only serious gap between our positions seems to concern quality scores. Dr. Olkin would attempt to salvage them by various <b>fix-ups,</b> under the heading of sensitivity analyses. I will thus elaborate my arguments that, with proper analysis of quality-score components, qual-ity scores (and any <b>fix-ups)</b> are superfluous and that, without component analyses, qual-ity scores can be misleading.

50|$|<b>Fix-ups</b> {{first became}} an {{accepted}} {{practice in the}} 1950s, when science fiction and fantasy were {{making the transition from}} being published mostly in pulp magazines, to being published mostly in book form.

2500|$|Noon: 22nd Century (Russian: Полдень. XXII век, Polden'. Dvadcat' vtoroy vek) is a 1961 {{science fiction}} book by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, {{expanded}} in 1962 and further in 1967, translated into English in 1978. It is sometimes considered an episodic novel, collection of linked short stories or a <b>fix-up</b> as some parts {{had been published}} previously as independent short stories. It relates several stories of the 22nd century, while providing the background [...] "feel" [...] for the style of life which {{gave birth to the}} Noon Universe.|$|E

2500|$|All of the {{previously}} published stories in Bishop's UrNu sequence, along with a new novella, [...] "Death Rehearsals", are contained in Catacomb Years, a <b>fix-up</b> published in 1979 by Berkley/Putnam. [...] Bishop also wrote new connecting material and provided a timeline. Spider Robinson's comments on the book's structure: [...] "Plainly [...] intended the Domed City to be a metaphor for something or other…and it probably worked just fine {{in some of those}} individual novelettes, where an emotionally involving story made you overlook a shaky premise. [...] But the [...] "novel" [...] has no emotional continuity… There are a few marvelous stories in this book, and one superb one , but they are ruined by a setting which exposes their worst weaknesses." [...] Robert Frazier strongly disagrees: [...] "Catacomb Years is not a rough sculpture with visible seams and weak welds; it is a polished puzzle entity a la Miguel Berrocal." [...] Author Elizabeth Lynn was equally impressed: [...] "Bishop takes his wildly diverse plot elements…and weaves them into a shining and almost seamless tapestry… The material, to those who have read the pieces as they appeared…will be familiar and friendly. [...] But set against each other they acquire new significance and a new luster. [...] Bishop's skill at characterization is impressive, as is his ability to juggle his cast and his numerous subplots." ...|$|E
50|$|The novel {{combines}} {{elements of}} fantasy and horror, analyzing the conflicting natures {{of good and}} evil which exist within all individuals. Unlike many of Bradbury's other novel-length works, such as Dandelion Wine and The Martian Chronicles, which are <b>fix-ups,</b> Something Wicked This Way Comes is a single full-length narrative.|$|R

50|$|The implied {{disadvantages}} of a one-pass compiler can largely {{be overcome by}} adding fix-ups, where provision is made for fix-ups during the forward pass, and the fix-ups are applied backwards when the current program segment has been recognized as having been completed. An example where such a <b>fix-up</b> mechanism would be useful would be a forward GOTO statement, where {{the target of the}} GOTO is unknown until the program segment is completed. In this case, the application of the <b>fix-up</b> would be delayed until the target of the GOTO was recognized. Obviously, a backward GOTO does not require a <b>fix-up.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The last {{of these}} {{terminated}} the sequence with {{the close of}} Elric's life. [...] After these initial Elric tales, Moorcock periodically published short tales throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, such as 1967's [...] "The Singing Citadel" [...] and 1973's [...] "The Jade Man's Eyes". [...] Meant {{to be placed in}} between the initial stories but before the conclusion of [...] "Doomed Lord's Passing", these later stories would frequently be edited, retitled, and combined together with other material to form <b>fix-ups</b> as part of later republication campaigns.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>fix-ups</b> {{in their}} final form are more of a short story cycle or episodic novel rather than a {{traditional}} novel with a single main plotline. This is true of both Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles and Isaac Asimov's I, Robot both of which read {{as a series of}} short stories with shared plot threads and characters but each of which still acts as a self-contained story. By contrast, A.E. Van Vogt's The Weapon Shops of Isher is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.|$|R

50|$|Although {{architects of}} {{the second phase of}} the Case Study House Program never gave up their belief in the {{potential}} of steel framing for residential construction, the public never embraced the material. As Elizabeth A. T. Smith explained: “Unfortunately, the economic pressures of the era were pushing residential construction another way, to accommodate the merchant builders working to deskill building tradesman and architects, and to glorify the add-ons and <b>fix-ups</b> of Mr. Homeowner and Mrs. Consumer, the stock characters of American advertising lobbying of the 1920s and 30s.” Although they imagined factory-based industrial materials could be more economical then traditional wood framing, this was never realized. As such steel-framing faced social and economical obstacles. In the end, the Levittown paradigm would dominate America’s mass housing strategy in the post war era.|$|R
