5|$|Johannes Kepler {{researched}} stellations {{that create}} regular star polyhedra (the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra) in 1619, but the complete <b>icosahedron,</b> with irregular faces, was first studied in 1900 by Max Brückner.|$|E
5|$|This {{polyhedron}} is {{the seventeenth}} stellation of the <b>icosahedron,</b> and given as Wenninger model index 42.|$|E
5|$|When {{regarded}} as a star <b>icosahedron,</b> the complete stellation is a noble polyhedron, because it is both isohedral (face-transitive) and isogonal (vertex-transitive).|$|E
50|$|Golden triangles {{are found}} in the nets of several stellations of dodecahedrons and <b>icosahedrons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Icospheres are <b>icosahedrons</b> which {{possess a}} {{sufficient}} number of triangles to resemble a sphere.|$|R
50|$|Many viruses have radial symmetries, {{their coats}} being {{composed}} of {{a relatively small number}} of protein molecules arranged in a regular pattern to form polyhedrons, spheres, or ovoids. Most are <b>icosahedrons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Escher's {{later work}} Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure) {{returned}} {{to the theme of}} polyhedral compounds, depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the compound of the cube and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and <b>icosahedron.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prolate: This is an <b>icosahedron</b> {{elongated}} {{along the}} fivefold axis {{and is a}} common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages. This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end.|$|E
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular <b>icosahedron</b> is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the <b>icosahedron.</b> Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
50|$|The virions of Tectiviridae {{species are}} non-enveloped, {{icosahedral}} and display a pseudo T=25 symmetry. The capsid has two layers. The outer layer is a protein structure of 240 capsid proteins trimers, {{and the inner}} one is a proteinaceous lipid membrane which envelopes the virus genome. Apical spikes extending about 20 nanometers (nm) protrude from the <b>icosahedrons</b> vertices.|$|R
50|$|The full snub 5-cell or omnisnub 5-cell, {{defined as}} an {{alternation}} of the omnitruncated 5-cell, {{can not be made}} uniform, but it can be given Coxeter diagram , and symmetry +, order 120, and constructed from 90 cells: 10 <b>icosahedrons,</b> 20 octahedrons, and 60 tetrahedrons filling the gaps at the deleted vertices. It has 300 faces (triangles), 270 edges, and 60 vertices.|$|R
50|$|A twelve-sided polygon is a dodecagon. A twelve-faced {{polyhedron}} is a dodecahedron. Regular {{cubes and}} octahedrons both have 12 edges, while regular <b>icosahedrons</b> have 12 vertices. Twelve is a pentagonal number. The densest three-dimensional lattice sphere packing has each sphere touching 12 others, {{and this is}} almost certainly true for any arrangement of spheres (the Kepler conjecture). Twelve is also the kissing number in three dimensions.|$|R
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from <b>icosahedron,</b> a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's {{first major}} astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery) , {{was the first}} {{published}} defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found {{that each of the}} five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—octahedron, <b>icosahedron,</b> dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.|$|E
25|$|As another example, {{the graph}} of the <b>icosahedron</b> is a double cover of the {{complete}} graph K6; to obtain a covering map from the <b>icosahedron</b> to K6, map each pair of opposite vertices of the <b>icosahedron</b> to a single vertex of K6. However, the <b>icosahedron</b> is not bipartite, {{so it is not}} the bipartite double cover of K6. Instead, it can be obtained as the orientable double cover of an embedding of K6 on the projective plane.|$|E

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The virus-like particle (VLP) assembled from capsid subunits {{of the dragon}} grouper nervous necrosis virus (DGNNV) {{is very similar to}} its native T = 3 virion. In order to investigate the effects of four cysteine residues in the capsid polypeptide on the assembly/dissociation pathways of DGNNV virions, we recombinantly cloned mutant VLPs by mutating each cysteine to destroy the specific disulfide linkage as compared with thiol reduction to destroy all S–S bonds. The mutant VLPs of C 187 A and C 331 A mutations were similar to wild-type VLPs (WT-VLPs); hence, the effects of Cys 187 and Cys 331 on the particle formation and thermostability were presumably negligible. Electron microscopy showed that either C 115 A or C 201 A mutation disrupted de novo VLP formation significantly. As shown in micrographs and thermal decay curves, b-mercaptoethanol-treated WT-VLPs remained intact, merely resulting in lower tolerance to thermal disruption than native WT-VLPs. This thiol reduction broke disulfide linkages inside the pre-fabricated VLPs, but it did not disrupt the appearance of <b>icosahedrons.</b> Small dissociated capsomers from EGTA-treated VLPs were able to reassemble back to <b>icosahedrons</b> in the presence of calcium ions, but additional treatment with b-mercaptoethano...|$|R
40|$|Although {{pressured}} {{metallic glass}} (MG) {{has been reported}} in the literature; there are few studies focusing on pressure effects on the structure; dynamics and its plastic deformation. In this paper; we report on and characterize; via molecular dynamics simulation, the structure and dynamics heterogeneity of pressured MGs, and explore a causal link between local structures and plastic deformation mechanism of pressured glass. The results exhibit that the dynamical heterogeneity of metallic liquid is more pronounced at high pressure, while the MGs were less fragile after the release of external pressure, reflected by the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP). High pressure glass shows better plastic deformation; and the local strain zone distributed more uniformly than of in normal glass. Further research indicates that although the number of <b>icosahedrons</b> in pressured glass was much larger than that in normal glass, while the interpenetrating connections of icosahedra (ICOI) exhibited spatial correlations were rather poor; In addition, the number of ‘fast’ atoms indexed by the atoms’ moving distance is larger than that in normal glass; leading to the sharp decreasing in number of <b>icosahedrons</b> during deformation. An uniform distribution of ‘fast’ atoms also contributed to better plastic deformation ability in the pressured glass. These findings may suggest a link between the deformation and destruction of icosahedra with short-range order...|$|R

25|$|Geodesic domes are {{the upper}} portion of {{geodesic}} spheres. They {{are composed of}} a framework of triangles in a polyhedron pattern. The structures are named for geodesics and are based upon geometric shapes such as <b>icosahedrons,</b> octahedrons or tetrahedrons. Such domes can be created using {{a limited number of}} simple elements and joints and efficiently resolve a domes internal forces. Their efficiency is said to increase with size. Although not first invented by Buckminster Fuller, they are associated with him because he designed many geodesic domes and patented them in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Three {{types of}} {{intelligent}} puzzle, a three-dimensional Escher puzzle (3 DES), a 3 D jigsaw puzzle (3 DJG) and a color matching cubocatahedron puzzle (CUB), are developed by layer manufacturing. Each puzzle contains a common packing problem. Furthermore, there exist two important mechanisms, {{the rotation of}} CUB and the translation of 3 DJG. 3 DES is obtained {{on the basis of}} periodic arrangement of <b>icosahedrons,</b> 3 DJG is patterned from a dovetail joint, and CUB is derived from the closest packing of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe lattice {{dynamics}} of double-filled skutterudites InxYbyCo 4 Sb 12 {{have been studied}} by means of Raman spectra {{as a function of}} the In and Yb filling ratios. We have studied the impact of void-filling process on the peak position and peak linewith. In particular, the relative height of the higher-energy Ag mode decreases gradually upon void-filling, which has been attributed to the “rattling” effects of the filling atoms in Sb <b>icosahedrons.</b> It is found that the double-filling process has produced more pronounced “rattling” effects than the single-filling process, accounting for more effective scattering of phonons and lower lattice thermal conductivity...|$|R

30|$|The {{chemistry}} of boron {{resembles that of}} carbon {{in its ability to}} catenate and form molecular networks. Unlike carbon, bulk boron cannot be found in nature and all known boron allotropes where obtained in the laboratory. All of them are based on different arrangements of B 12 <b>icosahedrons.</b> It is very natural to believe that not only carbon but also boron posesses molecular allotropes (fullerenes and nanotubes). Experimental and theoretical research on the {{chemistry of}} boron nanomaterials is developing rapidly. The existence of quasi-planar [1] and tubular [2] boron clusters was predicted by theory and confirmed more recently by experiment [3, 4]. Up to now, however, very {{little is known about the}} properties of these novel boron nanostructures.|$|R
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of a family of blow-up solutions of a mean field equation on sphere. The solutions blow up at four points where the minimum value of a potential energy function (involving the Green's function) is attained. The four blow-up points form a regular tetrahedron. Moreover, the solutions we build have a group of symmetry $T_d$ which is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_ 4 $. Other families of solutions can be similarly constructed with blow-up points at the vertices of equilateral triangles on a great circle or other inscribed platonic solids (cubes, octahedrons, <b>icosahedrons</b> and dodecahedrons). All of these solutions have the symmetries of the corresponding configuration, while they are non-axially symmetric. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
5000|$|The {{centered}} icosahedral cluster [...] is {{the basis}} of constructing large gold nanoclusters. [...] is the endpoint of atom-by-atom growth. In other words, starting with one gold atom up to , each successful cluster is created by adding one additional atom. The icosahedral motif is found in many gold clusters through vertex sharing ( [...] and [...] ), face-fusion ( [...] and [...] ), and interpenetrating biicosahedrons ( [...] , , , and [...] ). Large gold nanoclusters can essentially be reduced to a series of <b>icosahedrons</b> connecting, overlapping, and/or surrounding each other. The crystallization process of gold nanoclusters involves the formation of surface segments that grow towards the center of the cluster. The cluster assumes an icosahedral structure because of the associated surface energy reduction.|$|R

A regular polyhedron is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein used over and over again; this saves space in the viral genome.|$|E

40|$|The local order {{units of}} dense simple liquid are {{typically}} three dimensional (close packed) clusters: hcp, fcc and <b>icosahedrons.</b> We {{show that the}} fluid demonstrates the superstable tetrahedral local order up to temperatures several orders of magnitude higher than the melting temperature and down to critical density. While the solid-like local order (hcp, fcc) disappears in the fluid at much lower temperatures and far above critical density. We conclude that the supercritical fluid shows the temperature (density) driven two stage "melting" of the three dimensional local order. We also find that the structure relaxation times in the supercritical fluid are much larger than ones estimated for weakly interactive gas even far above the melting line. Comment: 5 + 5 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of metallic glasses is a long-standing question because {{the lack of}} long-range order makes diffraction based techniques difficult to be applied. Here, we used scanning tunneling microscopy with large tunneling resistance of 6 G Omega at low temperature {{in order to minimize}} forces between probe and sample and reduce thermal fluctuations of metastable structures. Under these extremely gentle conditions, atomic structures of Ni 40 Ta 60 metallic glasses are revealed with unprecedented lateral resolution. In agreement with previous models and experiments, icosahedral-like clusters are observed. The clusters show a high degree of mobility, which explains the need of low temperatures for stable imaging. In addition to <b>icosahedrons,</b> chain-like structures are resolved and comparative density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these structures are metastable. The co-existence of icosahedral and chain-like structures might be an key ingredient for the understanding of the mechanical properties of metallic glasses...|$|R
