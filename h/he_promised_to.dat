5|$|It {{was only}} Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 {{election}} {{he had some}} sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.|$|E
5|$|During an {{official}} visit by an Afghan delegation, Kosygin and Andrei Kirilenko criticised Afghan leaders Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafizullah Amin for Stalinist-like repressionist behaviour. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> send more {{economic and military}} aid, but rejected any proposal regarding a possible Soviet intervention, as an intervention in Afghanistan would strain the USSR's foreign relations with the First World according to Kosygin, most notably West Germany. However, in a closed meeting, without Kosygin, who strongly opposed any kind of military intervention, the Politburo unanimously supported a Soviet intervention.|$|E

His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E
5|$|Kratos is {{a warrior}} who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal {{that he was}} once a {{successful}} captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged {{in the depths of}} Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George {{to announce}} his candidacy for governor of Kentucky. The announcement surprised most political observers because of his prior political apathy and because Brown had spent considerable time {{out of the state}} with his business ventures and lavish lifestyle. Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive media campaign promoting his candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> run the state government like a business and to be a salesman for the state as governor.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{founded the}} Theological Repository in 1768, a journal {{committed}} to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material {{became the basis for}} many of his later theological and metaphysical works). After only a few years, {{due to a lack of}} funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 {{donations}} from friends and family. In return, <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they would at least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned that}} Obote was {{planning}} to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported {{in the streets of}} Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be announced when the situation was normalised. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> release all political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In 1290, Edward's {{father had}} {{confirmed}} the Treaty of Birgham, in which <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> marry his six-year-old {{son to the}} young Margaret of Norway, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. Margaret died later that year, bringing {{an end to the}} plan. Edward's mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence. Edward I was distraught at his wife's death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor on her death. Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure a lasting peace with France, but war broke out in 1294. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the Count of Flanders, but this too failed after it was blocked by King Philip IV of France.|$|E

5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Slipknot began touring at {{the first}} ever Mayhem Festival, a music festival founded by Kevin Lyman and John Reese. During the opening date of the Mayhem Festival 2008 on July 9 at Auburn, Washington, turntablist Sid Wilson broke both of his heels after jumping from an {{elevated}} area of the stage and landing incorrectly. Despite the injury, <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> perform on all dates of the tour in a wheelchair. Wilson returned to the band, in a wheelchair and with both his legs in casts, on the second date of the festival at Mountain View, California; he did, however, perform without the wheelchair at times.|$|E

5|$|By the afternoon, the {{majority}} of Soyuz members favoured an immediate vote. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Anatoly Lukyanov, had already departed for Novo Ogarevo {{to take part in}} constitutional negotiations and <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> tell Gorbachev about the vote. In his place stood Ivan Laptev, a pro-Gorbachev reformer, who did not trust Lukyanov and tried to stall the vote by demanding a statement from the KGB, Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. According to Laptev, the mood was such that if a vote had been taken Pavlov would have won. At the time, both the Soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the Soviet Government and so they too supported Pavlov's program. Soyuz, through a vote, was able to increase the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers, and gave the institution the right of legislative initiative.|$|E
5|$|In January 1965, the junta-appointed Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương {{intensified}} the anti-communist war effort by expanding military expenditure using aid money and equipment from the Americans, {{and increasing the}} size of the armed forces by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-Hương demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and Buddhists who wanted negotiations. Reliant on Buddhist support, Khánh did little to try to contain the protests. Khánh then decided to have the armed forces take over the government. On January 27, with the support of Thi and Kỳ, Khánh removed Hương in a bloodless putsch. <b>He</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed some of the officers supported Khánh's increased power to give him an opportunity to fail and be removed permanently. Khánh persisted with the facade of civilian government by retaining figurehead chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu and making economics professor Nguyễn Xuân Oánh the caretaker prime minister.|$|E
5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, <b>he</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> end their religious persecution and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E
