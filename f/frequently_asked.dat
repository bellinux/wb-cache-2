5|$|Sorrell {{explained}} that, {{during the}} marketing campaign, the team were <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> {{to go to}} graveyards for photo-shoots. These usually went without incident, but on one occasion a vicar asked them why they were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1942, Finucane {{was given}} command of No. 602 Squadron RAF at RAF Redhill. Five days later Group Captain Victor Beamish arrived {{as the new}} station commander. Beamish {{promoted}} Finucane instantly {{to the rank of}} squadron leader. Beamish had flown in the Battle of Britain and was posted to Group Captain Operations headquarters at 11 Group in 1941. Beamish <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> for an operational command and eventually Leigh-Mallory relented and gave him Redhill. Beamish was ordered not to fly on operations but usually flew whenever he felt like it. Beamish was killed on operations just two months later. Finucane observed 602's Glasgow traditions by reviving the squadron badge which pictured the Scottish lion rampant in red.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named Franco Rasetti with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the {{director}} of the physics laboratory, Luigi Puccianti, who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned tensor calculus, a mathematical technique invented by Gregorio Ricci and Tullio Levi-Civita that was needed to demonstrate the principles of general relativity. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.|$|E

5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E

Dr. Simon Coppard, marine biologist {{and member of}} the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, was directed to a listing on the site in 2004. Coppard was <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> to identify species, but did not recognise this particular specimen. Further investigation with the help of Heinke Schultz led him to realise it was a previously unidentified species.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Untener was roundly {{praised by}} his peers {{for his ability}} to manage his diocese, develop {{leadership}} skills in priests and laity, and delegate responsibilities. His approach allowed him the freedom to travel, teach, and give speeches regularly. Untener was <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> to speak to priests and ministers due to his reputation for a deep understanding of the scripture. Untener was perhaps best known for improving homilies by methods he promoted regarding preaching.|$|E

25|$|By World War I, {{with the}} birth of jazz, ragtime and new dance styles like the foxtrot and tango, Herbert reluctantly {{switched}} to writing musical comedies. These featured less elaborate ensembles and simpler songs for less classically trained singers than the European-style operettas that had dominated his earlier career. Herbert, during the last years of his career, was <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> to compose ballet music for the elaborate production numbers in Broadway revues and the shows of Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern, among others. He was also a contributor to the Ziegfeld Follies every year from 1917 to 1924.|$|E

25|$|After 1856 Espartero resolutely {{refused to}} {{identify}} himself with active politics, but was <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> to become involved. On 14 July 1858, he resigned as Premier. He {{refused to allow}} himself to be named as a candidate when the Cortes of 1868, after the Revolution, sought a ruler. Espartero, strangely enough, adopted a laconic phrase when successive governments on their advent to power invariably addressed themselves to him. To the Revolution of 1868, the Constituent Cortes of 1869, King Amadeus, the Federal Republic of 1873, the nameless government of Marshal Serrano during 1874, the Bourbon restoration during 1875, he simply said: Cumplase la voluntad nacional ("Let the national will be accomplished").|$|E
25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E

25|$|One of Canon Shehan's {{inherited}} pastoral {{duties in}} Doneraile, which he well acquitted, was {{to act as}} an independent intermediary between Viscount Doneraile and his tenantry; and between the tenantry and their landlord, so as to avoid the levels of agrarian strife experienced on beleaguered estates such as those of the nearby Earl of Kingston, and to secure the de facto religious liberty traditionally enjoyed by Catholics on the Doneraile estates. Sheehan's arrival in the parish came at a sensitive moment as tenants began the process of purchasing their holdings from the Doneraile, and other smaller local estates, {{under the terms of the}} Ashbourne Land Purchase Acts of 1885 and 1887. The Parish Priest of Doneraile was <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> to assist tenants in their approaches to the local land agents to agree terms for the purchase of their holdings.|$|E
25|$|English Earls are an Anglo-Saxon institution. Around 1014, England {{was divided}} into shires or counties, largely to defend against the Danes; each shire was led by a local great man, called an earl; the same man could be earl of several shires. When the Normans conquered England, they {{continued}} to appoint earls, but not for all counties; the administrative head of the county became the sheriff. Earldoms began as offices, with a perquisite of {{a share of the}} legal fees in the county; they gradually became honours, with a stipend of £20 a year; like most feudal offices, they were inherited, but the kings <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> earls to resign or exchange earldoms. Usually there were few Earls in England, and they were men of great wealth in the shire from which they held title, or an adjacent one, but it depended on circumstances: during the civil war between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, nine Earls were created in three years.|$|E
25|$|Web 2.0 {{is used by}} companies, {{non-profit}} {{organizations and}} governments for interactive marketing. A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, customer service enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis—Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content— to list answers to <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. Another marketing Web 2.0 lure {{is to make sure}} consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing. Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing. Saturating media hubs—like The New York Times, PC Magazine and Business Week— with links to popular new Web sites and services, is critical to achieving the threshold for mass adoption of those services. User web content can be used to gauge consumer satisfaction. In a recent article for Bank Technology News, Shane Kite describes how Citigroup's Global Transaction Services unit monitors social media outlets to address customer issues and improve products. According to Google Timeline, the term Web 2.0 was discussed and indexed most frequently in 2005, 2007 and 2008. Its average use is continuously declining by 2–4% per quarter since April 2008.|$|E
