Angela Webber of the Daily Journal of Commerce expressed {{her love for}} the sculpture and disappointment in the public's reaction. She wrote, [...] "This makes me so sad. [...] Apparently, this giant baby-faced deer statue isn't pretty enough for Milwaukie. [...] <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> folks of Milwaukie just don't get it." ...|$|E

I think that the saving of 530 children is, <b>I</b> <b>imagine,</b> <b>the</b> most moving experience a man can have. You say in Hebrew: 'The one who saves one life, is {{like the one that}} saved the life of the whole world.' [...] But when you save 530 children, it’s really unforgettable. I want to express, on behalf of our people, our nation, our recognition of your courage, your wisdom, of your determination under extremely difficult conditions".|$|E
2500|$|In the French {{edition of}} [...] "Lutetia" [...] Heine wrote, {{one year before}} he died: [...] "This confession, that the future belongs to the Communists, I made with an {{undertone}} of the greatest fear and sorrow and, oh!, this undertone by no means is a mask! Indeed, with fear and terror <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> time, when those dark iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future – oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order – And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist .... In my chest there are two voices in their favour which cannot be silenced .... because {{the first one is}} that of logic ... and as I cannot object to the premise [...] "that all {{people have the right to}} eat", I must defer to all the conclusions....The second of the two compelling voices, of which I am talking, is even more powerful than the first, because it is the voice of hatred, the hatred I dedicate to this common enemy that constitutes the most distinctive contrast to communism and that will oppose the angry giant already at the first instance – I am talking about the party of the so-called advocates of nationality in Germany, about those false patriots whose love for the fatherland only exists in the shape of imbecile distaste of foreign countries and neighbouring peoples and who daily pour their bile especially on France".|$|E

2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
