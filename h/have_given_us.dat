Time cannot dim our remembrance of them, nor lessen our {{gratitude}} to our Allies, who <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> the land in which many of them lie buried, so that we can care for their graves for ever. This was followed by the laying of a wreath, the dedication by the Dean, the hymn O Valiant Hearts (a war poem set to music to remember the fallen of the Great War), prayers, the first verse of the National Anthem, and the closing blessing. After the Prince and the Prime Ministers had left, the Abbey was opened to allow those waiting outside to join the rest of the congregation in viewing the memorial.|$|E

That is the message of the Reagan years." [...] A month later he announced he would seek the 1988 Libertarian Party nomination for president.|$|E

In response to the boycott, the City Commission of Birmingham punished the black community by withdrawing $45,000 ($ in [...] ) from a surplus-food program used primarily by low-income blacks. The result, however, was a black community more motivated to resist.|$|E

He however complimented that the overall outcome was [...] "satisfactory" [...] {{with a few of}} the songs even standing out.

Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E

According to the newspaper, the bridge was scheduled to be completed by July 1875. During the course of construction, John Ridenour lost a finger while working on the bridge. The new South Branch Bridge was completed well ahead of schedule in October 1874. The October 12, 1874, edition of the South Branch Intelligencer characterized the new bridge as a [...] "complete, handsome and durable structure", and further recounted that [...] "the contractors, Messrs. White & Sons, New Brighton, Pennsylvania 'Penn Bridge & Machine Works,' <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us,</b> in general opinion, a first rate, durable work, and deserve our best commendations.... We are confident that ours will realize a very handsome income and fully vindicate the wisdom of the County Court in voting its construction." ...|$|E
500|$|The I EP {{contains}} a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements {{and was a}} hint of the forthcoming album, 2005's Catch Thirtythree. The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, [...] "The eight-strings really <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. We wanted to get as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|When Sullivan {{turned to}} comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. Peter Gammond writes of [...] "misapprehensions and prejudices, {{delivered}} to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements {{that could not}} be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art." [...] As early as 1877 The Figaro wrote that Sullivan [...] "has all the ability to make him a great composer, but he wilfully throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling." [...] Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. The Theatre wrote that [...] "Iolanthe sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced." [...] However, comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The Athenaeum's review of The Martyr of Antioch declared: [...] "t is an advantage to have the composer of H.M.S. Pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art." ...|$|E

[...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have now is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E
500|$|E. H. Carr {{writes of}} Dostoevsky's {{character}} the young student Raskolnikov {{in the novel}} Crime and Punishment who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender {{on the principle of}} transcending conventional morals: [...] "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken conscience (which a less subtle writer would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us)</b> but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man." [...] Hermann Hesse wrote his Siddhartha to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his conscience on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all things could be unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic The Lord of the Rings describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in conscience to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in the Cracks of Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird (film))) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.|$|E

500|$|The film {{generated}} {{some political}} controversy. Republican members of Congress {{complained about the}} film's obviously leftist politics, and demanded that Will H. Hays, President of the Motion Picture Production Code, establish guidelines regarding propagandization for the motion picture industry. Critical reaction {{at the time was}} mixed. While at least one reviewer felt the film was reminiscent of motion pictures like Citizen Kane and Rebecca, Hedda Hopper called it [...] "Citizen Kane with all the art scraped off". Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, concluded that while {{the first half of the}} film was very good, the latter half felt slow and failed to deliver emotional punch. Crowther called the film [...] "a courageous and timely drama" [...] and praised Tracy and Hepburn for performances that featured [...] "taut solemnity". But the script seemed uneven dramatically ("...the nature of this story is a murder mystery and yet the interest is centered much more upon the dead man than on the hunt"), and a critical problem was that the audience [...] "is informed much sooner than the journalist what the nature of Forrest was, and the story drags while we wait for the journalist to catch up." [...] Crowther still enjoyed Cukor's direction, which he felt sustained mystery even when little existed. Like Crowther, the Chicago Tribune and other critics pointed out that the picture seemed slow. The Hartford Courant, meanwhile, raved about the film: [...] "Hepburn and Tracy <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a great film in Keeper of the Flame... Great because of the courage and daring it took to make it, the magnificent production it has been given, the excellent acting within it, and the exciting, tense story it contains." [...] Generally speaking, the film was better received in the eastern half of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E
