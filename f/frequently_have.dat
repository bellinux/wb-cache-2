5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns <b>frequently</b> <b>have</b> public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E

5|$|Ways of life {{often viewed}} as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, <b>frequently</b> <b>have</b> explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of their}} order of worship. Similarly, religious men with long hair include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, {{as was the case with}} the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals <b>frequently</b> <b>have</b> {{elongated}} limbs {{that help}} them cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{body has}} a {{hardened}} exoskeleton, {{except for the}} abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for piercing and suck blood or fruit juices. Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced. The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, act as olfactory radar, and also aid navigation, orientation and balance during flight. In moths, males <b>frequently</b> <b>have</b> more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external genitalia. The genitalia are complex and {{provide the basis for}} family identification and species discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation <b>frequently</b> <b>has</b> specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K).
