In this article an overview is presented of divergent types of ferromagnetic pinning centers. The investigated hybrid structures consist of Pb films that are deposited {{on top of}} arrays of ferromagnetic dots with in-plane magnetization (<b>IPM)</b> <b>or</b> out-of-plane magnetization (OPM), ferromagnetic films with <b>IPM</b> <b>or</b> OPM that contain arrays of submicron holes (antidots), or continuous films with OPM and a magnetic domain structure. Interesting effects such as field-polarity dependent vortex pinning and the dependence of the pinning strength on the domain structure of the ferromagnet are observed. Our experiments demonstrate that vortex pinning in superconductors is strongly influenced by the magnetic properties of the different ferromagnetic pinning centers. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Cutting speed (also called {{surface speed}} or simply speed) is the speed {{difference}} (relative velocity) between {{the cutting tool}} and {{the surface of the}} workpiece it is operating on. It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time, typically surface feet per minute (sfm) or meters per minute (m/min). Feed rate (also often styled as a solid compound, feedrate, or called simply feed) is the relative velocity at which the cutter is advanced along the workpiece; its vector is perpendicular to the vector of cutting speed. Feed rate units depend on the motion of the tool and workpiece; when the workpiece rotates (e.g., in turning and boring), the units are almost always distance per spindle revolution (inches per revolution or ipr or millimeters per revolution mm/rev). When the workpiece does not rotate (e.g., in milling), the units are typically distance per time (inches per minute <b>or</b> <b>ipm</b> <b>or</b> millimeters per minute mm/min), although distance per revolution or per cutter tooth are also sometimes used.|$|R

During 2011 – 2013, semi-structured interviews (27) were conducted with the insectary owners, citrus pest management researchers and citrus growers. A national survey of citrus growers was undertaken. A mixed method design was followed to collect qualitative and quantitative data to analyse thematically. The Australian insectary industry started with citrus pest management in the 1970 s and since then the industry has expanded to five companies and 36 commercial biological control agents (commercial BCAs) in 2014. It has estimated gross sales below AUD 10 million for the 2010 – 2011 financial year and no export market. Users of commercial BCAs have larger farms, more employees and a consultant. The complexity of the adoption of commercial BCA is the main reason that deterred small farm owners. The insectary owners were cautious to keep their rearing methods and other information secret because of commercial confidentiality. The costs of establishing a new insectary, developing a new commercial BCA, logistics, biosecurity and skill shortage are major barriers.

Full thickness, thoracic, dog skin was mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells and randomly assigned to receive one of three 0. 025 % (0. 25. mg/mL) budesonide-containing formulations: Barazone (BZ, a novel formulation), isopropyl myristate (<b>IPM)</b> <b>or</b> propylene glycol (PG). At regular intervals over 84. h, the amount of budesonide penetrating or retained within the skin was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. The restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood mixed model predicted that the flux of budesonide from BZ was 9. 2 -fold (P< 0. 001) and 105 -fold (P< 0. 001) greater than from IPM and PG, respectively. Similarly, the skin retention of budesonide from BZ was more than 3 -fold (P< 0. 0001) and nearly 6 -fold (P< 0. 0001) greater than from IPM and PG, respectively.

On soil, it {{is used as a}} pre-plant soil fumigant in locations where a broad complex of soil-borne pests limit the production of certain crops, particularly when they are repeatedly grown on the same land. In SE Asia and the Pacific, the use of methyl bromide as a soil sterilant is only about 6 % of all methyl bromide used (UNDP, 1995). Alternative methods to control soil pests are widespread. Aware of the negative side effects of pesticides, alternative soil pest control practices with reduced chemical inputs are being suggested. Soil pest control practices include biological control by means of natural enemies and integrated methods, such as integrated pest management (<b>IPM)</b> <b>or</b> integrated crop management (ICM). This paper documents a number of cases of alternative soil pest control methods with reduced chemical inputs in commercial use for horticultural crops in Asia. In addition, alternatives that have been found effective in field and/or greenhouse trials are reviewed. Cases of alternative soil pest control methods used commercially for horticultural crops on modem as well as traditional farms in Asia are listed in Table 1. The methods range from relatively new techniques, such as substrates and solarisation, to improved methods of traditional techniques, such as composting. There is now greater appreciation and respect for low-input, traditional agricultural systems, and the methods that are employed by traditional farmers are recognised as often being more efficient and logical than previously thought.

A pneumonia model in C 57 BL/ 6 mice was used. The CLA dosage (13 mg/kg of body weight given intraperitoneally) was chosen to reach a maximum concentration of the drug in serum {{similar to that in}} humans and a time during which the serum CLA concentration remained above the MIC equivalent to 40 % of the interval between doses. Six groups (n = 15) were inoculated with Ab 11 or Ab 51 and were allocated to <b>IPM</b> <b>or</b> CLA therapy or to the untreated control group. In time-kill experiments, CLA was bactericidal only against Ab 11 whereas IPM was bactericidal against both strains.

The latent 72 -kDa gelatinase from either bovine <b>IPM</b> <b>or</b> Y- 79 media autoactivates without APMA in the presence of calcium and zinc after 72 hr at 37 °C, producing a fully active mixture of proteinase species, 50 (48 in Y- 79 medium), 38 and 35 kDa in size. The presence of inhibitory activity was examined in both whole bovine IPM and IPM fractions separated by SDS-PAGE. Whole IPM inhibited gelatinolytic activity of autoactivated Y- 79 -derived MMP in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitory activities are observed in two protein fractions of 27 - 42 and 20 - 25 kDa. Western blots using antibodies to human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and 2 (TIMP- 1 and - 2) reveal the presence of two TIMP- 1 -like proteins at 21 and 29 kDa in inhibitory fractions of the bovine IPM.

Conventional and IPM orchards use many organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. Allolobophora chlorotica and Lumbricus terrestris were very common in these orchards and were chosen for cholinesterase (ChE) characterisation. L. terrestris exhibits a two to threefold higher specific ChE activity than A. chlorotica. Based on substrate and inhibitors specificities {{it is likely that}} in L. terrestris, ChE activity is a true acetylcholinesterase (AchE). Characterization of cholinesterase from A. chlorotica is uncertain and cannot be classified as true AchE as {{an important part of the}} cholinesterase activity seems to be related to butyrylcholinesterase. To follow ChE activity in natural conditions, ten earthworms of each species were collected in each earthworm in April for L. terrestris and in April, May, August and November for A. chlorotica. ChE inhibition was observed in A. chlorotica at each date in most of the orchards under <b>IPM</b> <b>or</b> conventional protection strategy and never in organic or abandoned orchards. Surprisingly, inhibition was still observed in November, i. e. 2 months after the last pesticide application. For L. terrestris, ChE inhibition was only observed in 2 orchards under conventional protection strategy. The difference between the two earthworm species could be due to (i) their different forms of ChE or (ii) to difference in exposure related to difference of behaviour.

Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and ethylcellulose (EC) were used as hydrophilic and hydrophobic film formers, respectively. Effects of HPMC/EC ratios and plasticizers on mechanical properties of free films were studied. Effects of HPMC/EC ratios on moisture uptake, in vitro release and permeation through pig ear skin of diltiazem HCl films were evaluated. Influence of enhancers including isopropyl myristate (IPM), isopropyl palmitate (IPP), N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, and Tween 80 on permeation was evaluated. It was found that addition of EC into HPMC film produced lower ultimate tensile strength, percent elongation at break and Young’s modulus, however, addition of EC up to 60 % resulted in too hard film. Plasticization with dibutyl phthalate (DBP) produced higher strength but lower elongation as compared to triethyl citrate. The moisture uptake and initial release rates (0 – 1  h) of diltiazem HCl films decreased with increasing the EC ratio. Diltiazem HCl films (10 : 0, 8 : 2 and 6 : 4 HPMC/EC) were studied for permeation because of the higher release rate. The 10 : 0 and 8 : 2 HPMC/EC films showed the comparable permeation-time profiles, and had higher flux values and shorter lag time as compared to 6 : 4 HPMC/EC film. Addition of <b>IPM,</b> IPP <b>or</b> Tween 80 could enhance the fluxes for approx. three times while Tween 80 also shorten the lag time.

The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of combined applications of cultural practices and potato cultivars in reducing the incidences of nematode and thrips. Treatments evaluated were methods of nematode and thrips control by implementing IPM and conventional practices. A split-plot randomized complete block design with four replications was sed. The main plots were <b>IPM</b> <b>or</b> cultural practices (subsoiling, soil solarization and use of trap crop of marigold Tagetes erecta) and conventional practices using synthetic pesticides. The subplots were five potato cultivars, i. e. No. 095 (Herta x FLS– 17), 720050 /Kikondo, 676068 / I. 1085, Granola, and Atlantic. The results showed that applications of cultural practices in combination with potato cultivars reduced Meloidogyne spp. population and potato tuber damage by 53. 70 % and 61. 36 %, respectively, {{as well as a}} significantly decreased thrips population. In the cultural control plots, thrips populations were below the action threshold (10. 0 nymphs per leaf), therefore no single application of pesticide was used.

Next, we conducted and evaluated a six-month nurse child care health consultant (CCHC) -led education and consultation IPM intervention to increase IPM knowledge, IPM practices, IPM policies, and decrease the presence or evidence of pests. The pilot intervention study was conducted by three CCHCs in 20 FCCHs in three counties in California. Pre- and post-intervention measures were completed by the FCCH directors and observation measures were completed by the CCHCs. Results indicated significant increases in IPM knowledge, (t-statistic (degrees of freedom), (t(df) = 2. 55 (10), p < 0. 05), increases in IPM practices (t(df) = − 6. 47 (17), p < 0. 05), and a 90 % reduction in the prevalence of pests. There {{were no significant differences}} in changes in IPM practices based on director education, FCCH county, <b>or</b> <b>IPM</b> intervention intensity <b>or</b> duration. A nurse-led IPM education and consultation intervention can reduce exposures of young children attending family child care homes to harmful chemicals...|$|R
40|$|The NYS IPM Program’s website is {{primarily}} a collection of documents about <b>IPM</b> practices, <b>or</b> about the program itself. Through the website one can access 12 Crop Profiles, 27 Elements of IPM, 117 Fact Sheets, 434 Project Reports, 10 Labeling documents, 80 Program description pages, 22 PSAs, over 100 online Brochures, Manuals, and Scholarly Papers, and numerous titles listed in our Catalog. Other supporting and informative pages bring the total to approximately 1800 pages. While the website in its current state is fulfilling its mission, (we expect to have over 1 million pages successfully downloaded by visitors this year), it was decided {{a year ago that}} the site could be much more efficient. Crafting ever-growing lists of our publications for static pages, and keeping them up-to-date, was becoming an overwhelming task. The graphic interface was beginning to look tired and old. A redesign was needed that would better handle the volume of information the site provides, and update its look...|$|R
40|$|E. F. Knipling, on the {{occasion}} of receiving the World Food Prize in 1992, stated that "major advances in coping with most of the major arthropod pest problems will require a change in the tactics and the strategies to manage those pests. They must change for the currently used limited scale, reactive, broad-spectrum measures to preventive approaches that are target specific and applied on an area-wide basis". Since then, practices to manage these pests have hardly changed and pesticide use is still on the rise every year {{to the detriment of the}} environment, human health and the ecosystem. The need for more target specific, sustainable, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective control tactics and pest management strategies remains to date more pertinent than ever. Integrated pest management (IPM) aims at the careful integration of several control tactics which are the most opportune for the particular ecosystem, while safeguarding human health and the environment. It has remained the dominant paradigm of pest control over the last half century. IPM can be applied on a field-by-field basis (localised <b>IPM),</b> <b>or</b> against an entire pest population within a delimited geographic area (area-wide (AW-IPM). AW-IPM seeks to treat all habitats, also those that are of no economic interest to the farmer, so that none produces migrants to re-establish significant infestations in areas of concern. This is in contrast to the field-by-field approach that focuses narrowly on defending the valued entity (crop, livestock, people, building, etc.). In most cases, AW-IPM leads to more effective and sustainable management of the insect pest. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a species-specific autocidal control tactic that interferes with the reproductive potential of the target insect pest. It is a very powerful tool that is most effective when insect populations are low and when applied on an area-wide basis. The SIT within an AW-IPM context can be applied for the suppression, eradication, containment or prevention of insect pest populations. There are numerous AW-IPM programmes where the SIT has been used successfully, especially against dipteran and lepidopteran pests, and examples will be given to illustrate this. On economic, environmental and biological grounds, the case for SIT is compelling...|$|R
40|$|Many museum {{collections}} {{are at risk}} for pest infestation, but historical collections in particular are susceptible to these degradations due to the prevalence of materials that attract pests. In the past, collections have been treated with chemical methods, but more recently, a new methodological approach, called Integrated Pest Management, <b>or</b> <b>IPM,</b> has emerged in caring for collections. In this thesis, Integrated Pest Management, defined as an integrative method of pest control, is examined in museums caring for historical collections. A survey of museums in North America that care for historical collections was conducted, resulting in a response rate of roughly 20...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Pest Management (IPM) {{functions}} as a system with pests, interactions, and feedback loops designed to achieve desired outcomes. In contrast, pest managers and specialists identify pests and problems with limited reference to how these factors behave within the system. This report summarizes a workshop sponsored by The Western IPM Coordinating Committee (WERA- 069) and The Western IPM Center to “Connect IPM Practices, Priorities, and Strategic Directions ” using systems tools and techniques. Workshop objectives included quickly drawing IPM systems by identifying pests, loops, and behaviors based on conversations with blueberry, nursery, and vegetable growers in Oregon. Attendees considered value-added if systems diagrams were included in Pest Management Strategic Plans 2 (PMSP’s) and the national IPM Roadmap 3. Methods: As blueberry, nursery, and vegetable growers described their crop and pest management systems, workshop attendees identified <b>IPM</b> factors <b>or</b> components, loops, and leverage or critical places in the system where change may occur. This technique or ActionGram represents steps that people use to consider systems with initial drafts completed in 10 -minutes (William, 2002) ...|$|R
