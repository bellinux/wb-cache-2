5|$|Separation of {{trivalent}} actinides from lanthanide {{fission products}} {{can be done}} by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 <b>exchange</b> <b>column)</b> treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.|$|E

A decrease in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while an {{increase in}} pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange. By lowering the pH of the solvent in a cation <b>exchange</b> <b>column,</b> for instance, more hydrogen ions are available to compete for positions on the anionic stationary phase, thereby eluting weakly bound cations.|$|E

2500|$|An {{analytical}} purification generally utilizes three {{properties to}} separate proteins. [...] First, proteins may be purified {{according to their}} isoelectric points by running them through a pH graded gel or an ion <b>exchange</b> <b>column.</b> [...] Second, proteins can be separated according to their size or molecular weight via size exclusion chromatography or by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis. Proteins are often purified by using 2D-PAGE and are then analysed by peptide mass fingerprinting to establish the protein identity. This is very useful for scientific purposes and the detection limits for protein are nowadays very low and nanogram amounts of protein are sufficient for their analysis. Thirdly, proteins may be separated by polarity/hydrophobicity via high performance liquid chromatography or reversed-phase chromatography.|$|E
2500|$|During purification, Haemophilus haemolyticus methyltransferase was overexpressed and {{purified}} using a high salt back-extraction step to selectively solubilize M.HhaI, {{followed by}} fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) as done previously by Kumar and colleagues. Authors utilized a Mono-Q anion <b>exchange</b> <b>column</b> {{to remove the}} small quantity of proteinaceous materials and unwanted DNA prior to the crystallization step. Once M.HhaI was successfully purified, the sample was then grown using a method that mixes the solution containing the complex at a temperature of 16°C and the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique to obtain the crystals. Authors were then able to collect the x-ray data according to a technique used by Cheng and colleagues in 1993. This technique involved the measurement of the diffraction intensities on a FAST detector, where the exposure times for 0.1° rotation were 5 or 10 seconds. For the structure determination and refinement, Klimasaukas and colleagues used the molecular replacement of the refined apo structure described by Cheng and colleagues in 1993 where the search models [...] X-PLOR, MERLOT, and TRNSUM were used to solve the rotation and translation functions. This {{part of the study}} involves the use of a variety of software and computer algorithms to solve the structures and characteristics of the crystal of interest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{separation}} of proteins {{will depend on}} the differences in total charge. Composition of ionizable side chain groups will determine the total charge of the protein at a particular pH. At the isoelectric point (pI), the total charge on the protein is 0 and it will not bind to the matrix. If the pH is bove the pI, the protein will have a negative charge and bind to the matrix in an anion <b>exchange</b> <b>column.</b> The stability of the protein at values above or below the pI, will determine if an anion exhange column or cation <b>exchange</b> <b>column</b> should be used.

The K East Basin currently contains six ion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> (IXCs) that were removed from service over 10 years ago. Fluor Hanford plans to immobilize the six ion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> (IXCs) in place in a concrete monolith. PNNL performed a structural assessment of the concrete monolith to determine its capability to absorb the forces imposed by postulated accidents and protect the IXCs from damage and thus prevent a release of radioactive material.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of interactions between phenolic compounds and metal ions fixed on cation exchange resins (SCX), standard solutions of phenolic compounds in ethanol were eluted through ion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> for solid phase extraction (SPE) saturated with the ions Fe(III),Al(III), or Cu(II). The compounds which form complexes with these ions remained adsorbed on these columns, whereas the others were released. The subsequent elution with the mixture 1 : 1 ethanol/ 1 N sulphuric acid then allowed the extraction also of adsorbed phenols. These results suggest the possibility of separating, by elution through ion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns,</b> classes of phenolic compounds of food products {{on the basis of}} their structural characteristics and of the cations present in ion exchange resins...|$|R
40|$|Ocean island basalts from Hawaii and Kerguelen were {{analyzed}} for their Pb isotopic compositions {{to assess the}} effect of acid leaching and matrix elimination by Pb anion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> on reproducibility and accuracy. Unleached samples consistently yield Pb isotopic ratios that reflect the incorporation of foreign material. Leaching removes up to 70 - 80 % of the total Pb content of the samples with corresponding weight losses between 35 and 60 %. The older and more altered Kerguelen basalts show better external reproducibility than the Hawaiian basalts, {{which appears to be}} due to the presence in the Hawaiian samples of more radiogenic contaminants (e. g., seawater Pb, drilling mud, and related alteration phases). All leached samples purified twice on anion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> show more radiogenic Pb isotopic ratios than those processed once. The difference is larger for tholeiitic basalts (Hawaiian and Kerguelen Plateau) than for transitional to alkalic basalts (Kerguelen Archipelago). The small differences in measured ratios of total procedural triplicates reflect differential elimination of residual alteration via leaching and matrix effects. The effectiveness of matrix elimination depends on the specific basalt composition, and tholeiitic basalts (i. e., low Pb concentrations) require two passes on anion <b>exchange</b> <b>columns.</b> This study shows that all steps in sample processing are critical for achieving accurate high-precision Pb isotopic compositions of ocean island basalts. © 2009 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

These elements may then be determined spectrochemically. Before developing suitable column procedures for the enrichment of trace constituents, the sequence with which both major and trace constituents of common igneous rooks and chondrites moved through cation <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> on elution with various concentrations of HCl were established.
