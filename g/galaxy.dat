5|$|A {{much larger}} <b>galaxy</b> cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby <b>galaxy</b> group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD <b>galaxy</b> at the center of Abell 2063. The active <b>galaxy</b> at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central <b>galaxy,</b> NGC 6051, is a radio <b>galaxy</b> that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio <b>galaxy,</b> 3C 317.

NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783.

5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio <b>galaxy</b> 3C 324.

In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007.

5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other.
