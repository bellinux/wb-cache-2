5|$|The {{story of}} StarCraft is {{presented}} through <b>its</b> <b>instruction</b> manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara {{in the wake of the}} Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.|$|E

25|$|Assembly {{language}} is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly {{language as a}} tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design {{would be hard to}} study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by <b>its</b> <b>instruction</b> set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly {{language is}} sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages. This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although calculators are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a pair of}} cases, the Seventh Circuit {{has dealt}} with {{how and when to}} {{instruct}} a jury that is given the Mt. Healthy test to apply. In Greenberg v. Kmetko it directed a district court to change <b>its</b> <b>instruction</b> to more closely match the test should the case be heard by a jury, even though it had granted qualified immunity to the defendants. Frank Easterbrook observed in 1992's Gooden v. Neal, where a correctional officer alleged he had been demoted in retaliation for exposing corruption, that [...] "any defendants do not want Mt. Healthy instructions and prefer to ask an either-or question of the jury" [...] since they also contend the activity the adverse action was in retaliation for was not protected by the First Amendment. [...] "Mt. Healthy is something of a misfit in such circumstances." [...] In that case, where the employer denied that the plaintiff's speech was in any way related to the adverse decision, the chose to shift the burden of proof of that to the employer as well, an approach Donald P. Lay of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation, criticized at length in dissent. In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the test still applies when a plaintiff presents only a circumstantial case that the adverse action was retaliatory as opposed to a direct one.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Norwegian Navy mobilized on 2 August 1914, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War. With Norway having declared herself a neutral country the torpedo boats were ordered to carry the lion's share of the neutrality protection patrols. This was despite their less than satisfactory seaworthiness in open seas, having been designed for service close to shore and in the many Norwegian fjords. The background for the decision to deploy the torpedo boats as the main Norwegian patrol force was based on the small ships being more economic to operate than the navy's larger vessels in a time of uncertain coal and oil supplies. In one episode during her First World War service Kjell intercepted the British submarine [...] on 2 July 1916. The submarine had hailed and fired two shots at the 578 ton Norwegian steamer SS Prunelle of Bergen, off Lindesnes in southern Norway. The British submarine managed to dive and make good its escape, but although E30s crew claimed that Prunelle was [...] from shore and hence outside Norwegian territorial waters, the Norwegians claimed that the steamer was only [...] from shore and therefore inside Norwegian waters. The Norwegians therefore protested that the attack had violated Norwegian territorial waters and that E30 had dived away and not remained on the surface. The neutrality violation had been so well documented that the UK government later issued an apology to its Norwegian counterpart, and revised <b>its</b> <b>instruction</b> to submarines operating closeto neutral coastlines.|$|E

2500|$|The first Wang VS {{computer}} {{was introduced in}} 1977, {{about the same time}} as Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX, and continues to be in use 39 years later. <b>Its</b> <b>instruction</b> set was compatible with the IBM 360 series, but it did not run any IBM 360 system software. The VS operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations. The VS was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general, and IBM in particular. While many programming languages were available, the VS was typically programmed in COBOL. Other languages supported in the VS integrated development environment included Assembler, COBOL 74, COBOL 85, BASIC, Ada, RPG II, C, PL/I, FORTRAN, Glossary, MABASIC, SPEED II and Procedure (a scripting language). Pascal was also supported for I/O co-processor development. The Wang PACE (Professional Application Creation Environment) 4GL and database was used from the mid-1980s onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens, hundreds of distinct application modules, and serving many hundreds of users. Substantial vertical applications were developed for the Wang VS by third party software houses throughout the 1980s in COBOL, PACE, BASIC, PL/I and RPG II. The Wang OFFICE family of applications and Wang WP were both popular applications on the VS. Word Processing ran on the VS through services that emulated the OIS environment and downloaded the WP software as [...] "microcode" [...] (in Wang terminology) to VS workstations.|$|E
2500|$|In the Instructions {{that were}} drawn up since 1462 the {{jurisdiction}} of the court as a tribunal of first instance was defined according to people who fell under its jurisdiction (ratione personae) and subject matters (ratione materiae) under its jurisdiction. In the category of people fell privileged persons like noblemen, Church officials and government officials, and [...] "defenseless" [...] people like women, clergymen, and widows and orphans, who deserved the special protection of the Count. Furthermore, foreigners without a fixed abode in Holland fell into this category. As to subject matter for the original jurisdiction of the court: all matters of concern to the Count, like his feudal Fees and domains, his rights (like Mint and High justice), and offices in his gift (read for [...] "Count" [...] after 1572 the States of Holland and Zeeland, who had already de facto taken over his sovereignty). Furthermore, important land-use cases, and conflicts between local governments fell under its jurisdiction, as did legal actions in connection with Possession (as opposed to Property actions). The last category was transferred to the original jurisdiction of the Hoge Raad after 1582, as was the original jurisdiction over cases of maritime law, and the grant of middelen van herstel en gunst (certain legal actions like e.g. the Cession of property by a debtor to his creditor). Unfortunately, when the Hoge Raad received <b>its</b> <b>Instruction</b> from the States-General in 1582 the Instruction of the Hof was not changed {{at the same time to}} reflect the transfer of competences in these respects. The Hof therefore continued hearing cases that formally belonged to the Hoge Raad which caused some competition between the two courts. Only in 1660 did the States of Holland resolve that in possession cases each court had to inform the other of such cases to make some coordination possible.|$|E
60|$|But I {{have been}} led {{a little too}} far from {{gratuitous}} instruction. If possible, instruction ought never to be altogether so. A child will soon learn to feel a stronger love and attachment to its parents, when it perceives that they are making sacrifices for <b>its</b> <b>instruction.</b> All that precept can teach is nothing compared with convictions of this kind. In short, unless book-attainments are carried on by the side of moral influences they are of no avail. Gratitude {{is one of the most}} benign of moral influences; can a child be grateful to a corporate body for <b>its</b> <b>instruction?</b> or grateful even to the Lady Bountiful of the neighbourhood, with all the splendour which he sees about her, as he would be grateful to his poor father and mother, who spare from their scanty provision a mite for the culture of his mind at school? If we look back upon the progress of things in this country since the Reformation, we shall find, that instruction has never been severed from moral influences and purposes, and the natural action of circumstances, in the way that is now attempted. Our forefathers established, in abundance, free grammar schools; but for a distinctly understood religious purpose. They were designed to provide against a relapse of the nation into Popery, by diffusing a knowledge of the languages in which the Scriptures are written, so that a sufficient number might be aware how small a portion of the popish belief had a foundation in Holy Writ.|$|E

60|$|It may {{perhaps be}} said of the sublime in novels,--which I have endeavoured to {{describe}} as not being generally of a high order,--that it is apt to become cold, stilted, and unsatisfactory. What may be done by impossible castles among impossible mountains, peopled by impossible heroes and heroines, and fraught with impossible horrors, The Mysteries of Udolpho have shown us. But they require a patient reader, and one who can content himself with a long protracted and most unemotional excitement. The sublimity which is effected by sparkling speeches is better, if the speeches really have something in them beneath the sparkles. Those of Bulwer generally have. Those of his imitators are often without anything, the sparkles even hardly sparkling. At the best they fatigue; and a novel, if it fatigues, is unpardonable. Its only excuse {{is to be found in}} the amusement it affords. It should instruct also, no doubt, but it never will do so unless it hides <b>its</b> <b>instruction</b> and amuses. Scott understood all this, when he allowed himself only such sudden bursts as I have described. Even in The Bride of Lammermoor, which I do not regard as among the best of his performances, as he soars high into the sublime, so does he descend low into the ludicrous.|$|E

We gave what was left from the first morning in the cathedral to a random exploration of the streets and places of the city. There was, no doubt, everywhere some touch of the bravery of our square of San Fernando, where the public windows were hung with crimson tapestries and brocades in honor of St. Raphael; but his holiday did not make itself molestively felt in the city's business or pleasure. Where we could drive we drove, and where we must we walked, and we walked of course through the famous Calle de las Sierpes, because no one drives there. As a rule no woman walks there, and naturally there were many women walking there, under the eyes of the popular cafes and aristocratic clubs which principally abound in Las Sierpes, for it is also the street of the principal shops, though it is not very long and is narrower than many other streets of Seville. It has its name from so commonplace an origin as the sign over a tavern door, with some snakes painted on it; but if the example of sinuosity had been set it by prehistoric serpents, there were scores of other streets which have bettered <b>its</b> <b>instruction.</b> There were streets that crooked away everywhere, not going anywhere, and breaking from time to time into irregular angular spaces with a church or a convent or a nobleman's house looking into them.|$|E
