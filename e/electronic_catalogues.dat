40|$|Currently, the {{electronic}} commerce (E-Commerce) knows an important growth, {{which results in}} the emergence of many commercial sites on the Internet network. The web sites of the providers propose to the consumers offers {{of products or services in}} <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogues.</b> Ontologies are generally used for the purpose of modelling the catalogues. In order to facilitate to the users the search of products or services, the commercial companies that are offering the same type of products gather their sites in electronic market places (E-Market Places) in which the transactions are guided by the use of a global catalogue that contains all the offers. We analyse in this paper the problems related to the E-Commerce, particularly the management problem of the <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogues</b> in the E-Market Places. For modelling the <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogues,</b> we propose a logical approach, based on Description Logics (DLs) issued from knowledge representation. We show how the reasoning services provided by knowledge representation systems based on DLs can support the operations of automatic cataloguing. The electronic commerce (E-Commerce) currently knows an important growth. The Internet network contributes to this growth at several levels by increasing the speed and the effectiveness of the commercial transactions, by improving the consumer services and by reducing the transaction costs [27].

5000|$|The Library {{was founded}} in 1946 to serve {{scientists}} working at the Karelian-Finnish Research Facility of the USSR AS. Its first director was S. P. Guima (1946—1953). In the following 19 years the library was headed by V. N. Yakovleva (1953—1972). In the 1970s, when the Library for Natural Sciences (LNS) was being established, KarRC RAS Scientific Library was {{also included in the}} RAS LNS centralized library system. For many years (1972—1992) the Scientific Library was headed by O. G. Satsuk. The main priority for the library was to supply KarRC RAS scientists with as much as possible relevant information from abroad. International book exchange was arranged through the USSR AS Library. In the 1970s the library got the chance {{to be included in the}} Interlibrary Loan (ILL) system to order literature from other libraries. A regular activity was the exhibitions of new arrivals to ease and expedite access to the books. Literature exhibitions have accompanied all large scientific conferences, symposia and seminars. Since 1954, the catalogue of publications by KarRC RAS staff has been maintained. In 1995 computerization of the library began, and the <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogue</b> was established based on computer technology.

40|$|Success {{is highly}} {{dependent}} {{on the ability of}} a company to efficiently produce optimal designs. In order to achieve this companies must minimise time to market and possess the ability to make fully informed decisions at the early phase of the design process. Such decisions may include the choice of component and suppliers, as well as cost and maintenance considerations. Computer modelling and <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogues</b> are becoming the preferred medium for the selection and design of mechanical components. In utilising these techniques, the designer demands the capability to identify, evaluate and select mechanical components both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative decisions generally encompass performance data included in the formal catalogue representation. It is in the area of qualitative decisions that the use of what the authors call "Informal Information" [1] is of crucial importance. Thus, "Informal Information" must often be incorporated into the selection process and selection systems. This would enable more informed decisions to be made quicker, without the need for information retrieval via discussion with colleagues in the design environment. This paper provides an overview of the use of electronic information in the design of mechanical systems, including a discussion of limitations of current technology. The importance of Informal Information is discussed and the requirements for association with web based <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogues</b> are developed. This system is based on a flexible XML schema and enables the storage, classification and recall of Informal Information packets. Furthermore, a strategy for the inclusion of Informal Information is proposed, and an example case is used to illustrate the benefits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} new {{automatic service}} intended for using telephone directory inquiries without human-operator. The developed {{automatic speech recognition}} system for Russian language solves for processing the voice input and answering the queries of users. The <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogue</b> ”Yellow Pages of Saint-Petersburg ” containing information about firms and organizations is used for debugging. The development of such system for Russian language has some problems, connected with complex structure of word-formation of Russian language. The developed speech recognition system SIRIUS has one additional level of Russian language representation- morphemic level. As a result the size of vocabulary and time for speech processing are significantly decreased. The dialogue model for voice control of <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogue</b> ”Yellow Pages ” and the first experimental results are presented in the paper and allow to say about good perspectives of development of telephone speech recognizer for Russian language...|$|R
