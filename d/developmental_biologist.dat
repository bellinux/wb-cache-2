25|$|The Sillaginidae are an oviparous, non {{guarding}} family, whose species tend to show similar reproductive {{patterns to}} one another. Each species reaches sexual maturity at {{a slightly different}} age, with each sex often showing a disparity in time of maturation. Each species also spawns over a different season and the spawning season often differs within a species, usually {{as a function of}} latitude; a feature not unique to sillaginids. The proximity to shore of spawning is also different between species, as each species usually does not migrate inshore to spawn, even if the juveniles require shallow water for protection, instead relying on currents. The fecundity of sillaginids is variable, with a normal range between 50 000 – 100 000. The eggs are small (0.6 to 0.8mm), spherical and pelagic, hatching around 20 days after fertilisation. The larvae are quite similar, requiring a trained <b>developmental</b> <b>biologist</b> to identify between species. The larvae and juveniles are {{at the mercy of the}} ocean currents, being too weaker swimmers to actively seek out coastlines. Currents are thought to have been responsible for the distribution of mainland species to offshore islands as well as the current widespread distribution of Sillago sihama. In all studied species, juveniles inhabit shallow waters in protected embayments, estuaries, tidal creeks and lagoons as well as exposed surf zones, usually over tidal flats and seagrass beds. As the fish mature, they generally move to deeper waters, showing a change in diet.|$|E
500|$|A custody dispute began {{between the}} two zoos, with the Bronx Zoo arguing {{that she would be}} better cared for in their facilities. Time {{magazine}} noted that it was the [...] "custody battle of the decade" [...] in the [...] "primate world", comparing Patty Cake's popularity and fame to that of child star Shirley Temple. <b>Developmental</b> <b>biologist</b> Ronald Nadler of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center was brought in to arbitrate the dispute and published a report that favored returning Pattycake to her mother and the Central Park Zoo. [...] In his report Nadler noted that [...] "the recommendation is based on the judgment that an infant gorilla is more likely to develop into a socially competent and reproductively adequate animal if it is raised in the company of its parents as opposed to being raised with a group of peers." ...|$|E

Cell biology is now beginning to help <b>developmental</b> <b>biologists</b> {{in their quest to}} understand how these molecules interact within cells to direct tissue behavior. This is particularly true in the areas of membrane trafficking and cell motility. Recent work has shown that various trafficking events such as secretion, endocytosis, segregation in membrane microdomains, intracellular transport, and targeting to lysosomes regulate various signaling pathways. It is likely that within the context of an embryo, these trafficking events are integrated such that secreted factors reliably orchestrate many developmental decisions...|$|R
