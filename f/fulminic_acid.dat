He did some research for the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik (BASF) in the early 1900s, and began doing research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially vat dyes such as indanthrene and flavanthrene, in 1903. Among other things, Scholl developed a method for the synthesis of pyranthron, the first nitrogen- and sulfur-free vat dye.|$|E
50|$|In 1825, Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig {{performed}} the first confirmed discovery and explanation of isomers, earlier named by Berzelius. Working with cyanic acid and <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid,</b> they correctly deduced that isomerism {{was caused by}} differing arrangements of atoms within a molecular structure. In 1827, William Prout classified biomolecules into their modern groupings: carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. After the nature of combustion was settled, a dispute about vitalism and the essential distinction between organic and inorganic substances began. The vitalism question was revolutionized in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea, thereby establishing that organic compounds could be produced from inorganic starting materials and disproving the theory of vitalism.|$|E
50|$|One of Liebig's {{frequent}} collaborators was Friedrich Wöhler. They met in 1826 in Frankfurt, after independently {{reporting on}} the preparation of two substances, cyanic acid and <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid,</b> that apparently had the same composition but very different characteristics. The silver fulminate investigated by Liebig, was explosive, whereas the silver cyanate found by Wöhler, was not. After reviewing the disputed analyses together, they agreed that both were valid. The discovery {{of these and other}} substances led Jöns Jacob Berzelius to suggest the idea of isomers, substances that are defined not simply by the number and kind of atoms in the molecule but also by the arrangement of those atoms.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the first {{detection}} in space of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid,</b> HCNO. This isomer of HNCO has been observed in three starless cores, B 1, L 1544 and L 183, and in the low mass star forming region L 1527 with a measured abundance ratio of HNCO/HCNO between 40 - 70. However, HCNO was not detected towards {{the direction of the}} cyanopolyyne peak of TMC- 1 or towards the Orion Hot Core region. The derived HNCO/HCNO abundance ratio in these cases is greater than 350 and 1000 in TMC- 1 and Orion, respectively. We find that CH 2 + NO → HCNO + H is a key reaction for the formation of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid.</b> A value of 5. 5 × 10 − 12 cm 3 s − 1 of the corresponding reaction rate coefficient, as given by Miller et al. (2003), allows to reproduce the observed abundances of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> in both the observed dark clouds and low mass star forming core, where the determined abundance of HNCO in these regions with respect to molecular hydrogen is 1 - 5 × 10 − 10...|$|E

Comparison {{of the theoretical}} results with the available experimentally derived values shows very satisfactory agreement. The new data should be helpful for the identification of these molecules due to characteristic hyperfine structure patterns in their microwave spectra.

Within a rigid-bender approximation, the potential energy function for the HCN bending was also determined using various CASSCF-MRCI wavefunctions, based on an ANO-type basis set (of 5 s 3 pld/ 4 s 2 p quality).

40|$|International audienceThe {{heterogeneous}} {{reactions of}} gas-phase ozone and two pyrethroid pesticides, deltamethrin and permethrin, {{which are the}} most frequently applied insecticides today, has been investigated. Tentative identifications of heterogeneous ozonolysis products of both pesticides reveal that the reaction mechanisms differ and are mainly influenced {{by the presence of}} the cyano moiety at the alpha-position of deltamethrin (pyrethroid type II). The mechanism study also suggests the important role of water. Finally, several of the degradation products emerged from the ozonolysis of deltamethrin and permethrin may pose further health and environmental hazard due to their higher toxicity, such as phosgene for permethrin, and bromophosgene, 3 -phenoxybenzaldehyde (3 -PBA) and <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> for deltamethrin.

40|$|The {{potential}} energy hypersurfaces {{corresponding to the}} addition reactions of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> (HCNO) to water, ammonia, and methanol have been explored using ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Geometries of stationary points were optimized at the HF/ 3 - 21 G, HF/ 6 - 31 G*, and MP 2 / 6 - 31 G* levels of theory while relative energies were estimated at the MP 4 -SDQ/ 6 - 31 G* and MP 2 / 6 - 31 G** levels.

40|$|International audienceWe report {{large-scale}} {{electronic structure}} calculations for <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid,</b> HCNO, isocyanic acid, HNCO, and cyanic acid, HOCN, in their ground electronic states.

Our results show the importance of including all electrons in the correlation treatment to obtain a converged molecular structure for the extremely floppy HCNO molecule and the correct energetics of the three isomers. All-electron correlation calculations and frozen core calculations with very large basis sets clearly converge towards a linear electronic minimum for HCNO surrounded by a very large flat region of the potential energy surface for hydrogen bending motions. For each of the three isomers we have computed the barrier to linearity along the respective minimum energy path and several spectroscopic parameters and equilibrium rotational constants...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of nitrile oxides is well documented. Several important monographs either specially devoted to nitrile oxides or including corresponding comprehensive chapters should be mentioned (1 – 5). Several reviews appeared (6 – 8), which concern preparation, reactivity, and synthetic applications of nitrile oxides. Some books and reviews devoted to individual aspects of nitrile oxide chemistry will be cited elsewhere.

Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to update the information concerning nitrile oxides published after the monograph (4).

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{mechanisms of}} 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reactions of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> (ONCH) and diazomethane (NNCH 2) with HCdropCH, NdropCH, and PdropCH are studied using ab initio molecular orbital methods. The reaction mechanisms {{can be classified}} into two classes: ionic electrocyclic and diradical coupling mechanism;. Ionic electrocyclic mechanism occurs in reaction systems with a large difference in electronegativities between the two atoms of the dipolarophile and their atoms react with the atoms with each opposite charge of a 1, 3 -dipole. Diradical coupling mechanism occurs through two processes: the first process is a one-electron movement from the edge atom to the center atom of a 1, 3 -dipole, {{which leads to a}} biradical state (for ONCH, the one-electron movement occurs from the oxygen to the nitrogen atom; for NNCH 2, the movement occurs from the carbon to the center nitrogen atom). The second process is the breaking of the pi-bond of the dipolarophile, which is strongly associated with the activation energy, followed by the formation of the new sigma-bond (cyclic reaction) through concerted or stepwise inodes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The C-H {{stretching}} fundamental of {{the free}} radical HCCN has been investigated under high resolution using infrared kinetic spectroscopy. This transient molecule was produced by the flash photolysis of dibromoacetonitrile (Br 2 HCCN) at 193 nm and its transient infrared absorption spectrum probed using a color center laser. Spectra of the molecule were collected between 3182 and 3274 cm- 1. The rotational analysis of the ν 1 fundamental places its origin at 3246. 657 cm- 1. Four hot bands associated with the bending vibrations have been observed; the vibrational and rotational assignment of three of these bands ν 1 + ν 5 - ν 5, ν 1 + ν 4 - ν 4, and ν 1 + 2 ν 5 ± 2 - 2 ν 5 ± 2 is definite. The ν 5 energy was obtained by measuring the intensity {{of a line of}} the ν 1 + ν 5 - ν 5 band relative to one of the fundamental and calculating the energy assuming a room temperature Boltzmann distribution.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid,</b> HCNO, with NH 2 radicals was studied using quantum chemical and theoretical kinetic methodologies. B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 2 p) calculations combined with CCSD(T) energy calculations at the basis set limit reveal a complex potential energy surface, where only two entrance channels {{contribute significantly to}} the product formation. Transition state theory and RRKM master equation calculations find a rate coefficient ranging from 7. 2  ×  10 - 12  cm 3 molecule− 1 s− 1 at room temperature, to >  1  ×  10 − 10  cm 3 molecule− 1 s− 1 at 3000  K. Despite a reduced efficiency in product formation due to fast redissociation of the adducts to the reactants at high temperatures, the title reaction can thus be an efficient sink for HCNO at combustion temperatures in nitrogen-rich environments. At 1  bar and below, H 2 NCO + NO is the dominant product, with H 2 NCN + OH and HCN + NHOH contributing weakly.

40|$|The cycloaddition {{reactions}} of 1, 3 -dipoles, including <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> (HCNO) {{and the simple}} azides (XNNN, X = H, CH 3, NH 2), with thionitroso compounds (R-N=S, R=H, NH 2) as dipolarophiles have been studied by density function procedures using the hybrid B 3 LYP exchange correlation function and 6 - 311 G(d, p) basis functions. For each system, two (HCNO) or four (azide) distinct transition structures have been located and the intrinsic reaction coordinate path was constructed. It appears in all cases that activation energies for the cycloadditions are rather. low, ranging from 0 to 30 kJ mol(- 1). The additions are not Stereospecific, the energy difference between transition structures having cis and trans dispositions of the N-R groups being rather small (less than a few kJ mol(- 1)). The addition shows a certain regioselectivity in which the attack of the O-atom of HCNO and N(R) of the azides to the S-atom of the dipolarophile is preferred. This regiochemistry is explained using recently developed DFT-based reactivity descriptors, such as local softness and Fukui functions. The hardness and polarizability profiles of the supersystem along the IRC paths were also discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The a-type {{rotational}} {{spectra of}} the covalent fulminates BrCNO, ClCNO, and NCCNO {{have been investigated}} by millimeterwave spectroscopy. Owing to extremely anharmonic XCN bending modes, the a-type rotational spectra of the halofulminates BrCNO and ClCNO exhibited very unusual patterns, whereas the low-lying CCN bending mode of cyanofulminate NCCNO appeared {{to be close to}} a harmonic bending mode of a linear molecule. This has been confirmed by a rovibrational spectrum of the CCN band system in the far infrared. The data for NCCNO have been analyzed with a linear molecule type hamiltonian, resulting in precise term values for the first to the fifth excited state of the CCN bending mode. The fundamental transition wavenumber has been determined to be 80. 5242 cm- 1. From semirigid bender analyses, effective barriers to linearity of 131 cm- 1 for BrCNO and 167 cm- 1 for ClCNO have been obtained. For NCCNO, a relatively flat bending potential with a significant quartic contribution has been found. Compared to the parent molecule, the well-known quasilinear molecule <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> HCNO, the halofulminates BrCNO and ClCNO are considerably 2 ̆ 7 more bent 2 ̆ 7, whereas cyanofulminate NCCNO is definitely 2 ̆ 7 more linear 2 ̆ 7. Barriers to linearity in covalent fulminates XCNO apparently strongly depend {{on the nature of the}} substituent X: pi-acceptor substituents lead to 2 ̆ 7 more linear 2 ̆ 7 molecules, whereas pi-donor substituents result in 2 ̆ 7 more bent 2 ̆ 7 molecules.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{structure and}} energy barrier for the concerted addition of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> to acetylene, a prototypical 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition, have been determined using various molecular orbital and density functional theory methods (MP 2, CCSD(T), G 2 (MS), G 2 (CC), CASSCF/CASPT 2, and B 3 LYP) {{with the aim}} of obtaining accurate energetics and finding an economical but reliable approach for treating larger substituted systems. Although the activation energy is not particularly sensitive to the geometries employed, it is strongly dependent on the treatment of dynamical electron correlation. The approximate G 2 (MS) appears to be an efficient and reliable treatment. Both CCSD(T) and CASPT 2 results agree with each other, suggesting that the energy barrier for the HCNO + HCCH addition amounts to about 14 kcal/mol. The electronic mechanism of the cycloaddition has also been probed further using DFT descriptors, as well as an analysis of the CAS-LMO-CI wave functions. The hardness profile along the minimum energy path shows a minimum in the saddle region, but the position of its minimum is somewhat shifted toward the product side compared to the maximum in energy profile. The variation of the coefficients of the excited configurations in the CAS wave function along the reaction path suggests that the transition state does correlate with a substantial electron movement from the O to the N of HCNO. The O thus behaves as a new bond acceptor center and the C as a new bond donor, in contrast with a picture previously derived from either the net charges distribution, or the motion of the centroids of Hartree-Fock based localized orbitals accompanying the nuclear approach of both reaction partners, or a spin-coupled valence bond analysis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{mechanism for}} the gas-phase concerted 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of diazomethane (CH 2 N 2) to ethene (C 2 H 4) is described through spin-coupled (SC) calculations at a sequence of geometries along the intrinsic reaction coordinate obtained at the MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d) level of theory. It is shown that the bonding rearrangements occurring {{during the course of}} this reaction follow a heterolytic pattern, characterized by the movement of three well-identifiable orbital pairs, which are initially responsible for the π bond in ethene and the C−N π bond and one of the N−N π bonds in diazomethane and are retained throughout the entire reaction path from reactants to product. Taken together with our previous SC study of the electronic mechanism of the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> (HCNO) to ethyne (C 2 H 2) (Theor. Chim. Acc. 1998, 100, 222), the results of the present work suggest strongly that most gas-phase concerted 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reactions can be expected to follow a heterolytic mechanism of this type, which does not involve an aromatic transition state. The more conventional aspects of the gas-phase concerted 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of diazomethane to ethene, including optimized transition structure geometry, electronic activation energy, activation barrier corrected for zero-point energies, standard enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy of activation, have been calculated at the HF/ 6 - 31 G(d), B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d), MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d), MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d,p), QCISD/ 6 - 31 G(d) and CCD/ 6 - 31 G(d) levels of theory.

40|$|The {{technique}} of infrared kinetic spectroscopy {{has been used}} to study the production of the propargyl radical from the reaction of singlet methylene with acetylene. The rate constant for this product channel was measured as (3. 5 ± 0. 7) × 10 - 10 cm 3 molecule- 1 s- 1 at 295 K, relative to the known rate for 1 CH 2 with H 2 or CH 4. Methylene was produced in the singlet state by excimer laser photolysis of ketene at 308 nm in the presence of acetylene and either H 2 or CH 4. Reaction of 1 CH 2 with acetylene produces propargyl, and reaction of 1 CH 2 with either H 2 or CH 4 produces CH 3. The intensity of a propargyl infrared absorption line was compared with that of a methyl infrared absorption line, and the rate of formation of propargyl was determined from the ratio of these two intensities and the known rates of reaction of singlet methylene. The relative peak infrared absorption cross-sections of methyl and propargyl were calibrated under the conditions of the experiment by photolyzing crotyl bromide at 193 nm to produce methyl and propargyl in equal concentrations. The reaction of the cyanomethylene (HCCN) radical with nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O 2) has also been investigated using infrared kinetic spectroscopy. The overall rate constants for each reaction have been determined. For the reaction with NO, the rate constant was determined to be (3. 5 ± 0. 6) × 10 - 11 cm 3 molecule- 1 s- 1, for reaction with O 2, the rate constant was (1. 8 ± 0. 4) × 10 - 12 cm 3 molecule- 1 s- 1. Several products were observed, but not quantified for either reaction. In the case of reaction with NO, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and <b>fulminic</b> <b>acid</b> (HCNO) were observed. During reaction with O 2, HCN, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were observed. Species looked for but not observed include isocyanic acid (HNCO), ethynyl (C 2 H) radical, cyanic acid (HOCN) and isofulminic acid (HONC). Under the conditions of our experiments, no reaction was observed between HCCN and the following: methane (CH 4), CO 2, acetylene (C 2 H 2), ethylene (C 2 H 4), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2). ...|$|E
