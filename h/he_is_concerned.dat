5|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> for {{the fate}} of Iraqis; through his {{friendship}} with an exiled Iraqi professor he learned of the totalitarian side of Saddam Hussein's rule, but also takes seriously his children's concerns about the war. He often plays devil's advocate, being dovish with this American friend, and hawkish with his daughter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{four years}} pass, and Kioe Gie has become {{editor-in-chief}} of Kemadjoean and married Ijan Nio. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned,</b> however, over the newspaper's new political orientation: the owner, Oeij Tjoan Siat, is aiming {{to make the}} paper pro-Dutch East Indies, a stance that Kioe Gie considers a betrayal to the ethnic Chinese. When Tjoan Siat comes to Kioe Gie's home {{to ask him to}} follow the former's new political leanings, heavily influenced by a monthly payment of 2,000 gulden offered by an unnamed political party, Kioe Gie refuses and resigns.|$|E

25|$|Macmillan tried, but failed, to see Eisenhower (who {{was also}} refusing to see Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd) behind Butler's and Eden's back. Macmillan {{had a number}} of {{meetings}} with US Ambassador Winthrop Aldrich, in which he said that if he were Prime Minister the US Administration would find him much more amenable. Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November. Eisenhower spoke highly of Macmillan ("A straight, fine man, and so far as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned,</b> the outstanding one of the British he served with during the war").|$|E
25|$|Angie {{returns to}} Walford, with her plans still secret, {{and tries to}} show {{interest}} in Den's plan to move the location of The Queen Vic, but it is plain to see that her mind is elsewhere. Den soon realises that she is seeing someone else, and although he doesn't care that she is with another man, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> {{for the state of}} his business. Den visits a solicitor and returns with papers protecting himself and his business should Angie decide to leave him again. Angie decides to leave in May of that year, still under a cloak of secrecy and only divulging her plan to leave on the night of her departure. Unfortunately for Angie, Den cruelly informs her that he has arranged things so that she won't {{be able to get a}} penny out of him. After their final showdown Angie gets into her taxicab and leaves Walford. This is Angie's last appearance.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavamithilāgamanam (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवमिथिलागमनम्) In {{only her}} sixth year, Sītā's {{appearance}} {{is like that}} of a sixteen-year-old. Her beauty is described by the poet in 12 verses (13.9–13.20). Janaka realizes that his daughter is the Ādi Śakti of Rāma and no ordinary girl, as she can drag the onerous bow of Śiva as a child. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> about Sītā getting a deserving husband. He thinks about the doctrine of Avatāra, having heard verses about it in the Vedas, but his intellect and rationalism make him not believe it. After much contemplation, he concludes that the doctrine must be true. Just then, a doorkeeper announces the arrival of Paraśurāma in Mithilā. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma. Knowing Janaka to be a noble king, Paraśurāma does not consider him to be his enemy, unlike the despotic Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma expresses his wish to see Sītā. Janaka leads him to the sacrificial assembly (Yajñaśālā), where Paraśurāma sees Sītā playing with the bow of Śiva by dragging it like a play-horse. Paraśurāma asks Janaka to hold a Svayaṃvara for Sītā in which the prince who breaks the bow of Śiva will have the right to marry Sītā. Paraśurāma further predicts that Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, will break the bow. Paraśurāma tells Janaka that he will arrive again in Mithilā, pretending to be angry, so that he can have an excuse of seeing both Sītā and Rāma. At the end of the canto Paraśurāma bows to the child Sītā and starts to praise her.|$|E

Marita reveals that the Smoking Man is dying and {{that he wants to}} find the UFO in Oregon to restart the Project. Krycek informs them that the UFO is hidden behind an energy field. The group, along with the Lone Gunmen, find evidence pinpointing the UFO's location. [...] Mulder makes it clear to Scully that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> for her health and refuses to let her accompany him back to Oregon. [...] Reciprocating his concern, Scully refuses to let Mulder return alone; Skinner accompanies Mulder instead.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{is given}} entirely free {{rein in the}} design. At the {{unveiling}} of the new car, Herb is horrified {{to find that the}} car is a badly-designed and hideously styled monstrosity that costs US$82,000, leaving Powell Motors bankrupt and out of business, while Herb's mansion is foreclosed and he loses everything he ever worked for. As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he {{would have been better off}} if he never met him and that as far as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned,</b> he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb. Before Homer can even answer what happened, Grampa remarks to Homer that he knew [...] "he'd blow it", and leaves in the cab he just arrived in, rather than getting in the car with the rest of the Simpson family.|$|E
500|$|Goya {{does not}} focus on {{the reasons for the}} shortage, nor does he {{apportion}} blame to any one party. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> only with its effect on the population. Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents. Hughes believes , Madre infeliz! (Unhappy mother!), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents [...] "a darkness {{that seems to be the}} very essence of loss and orphanhood". This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814. A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of aquatint in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were burnished.|$|E

500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that they always do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
