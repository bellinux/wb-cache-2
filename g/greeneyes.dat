5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, <b>greeneyes,</b> lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E

40|$|Background. The shortnose <b>greeneye,</b> Chlorophthalmus agassizi Bonaparte, 1840, is {{a species}} with a circumglobal {{distribution}} and {{is among the}} most abundant commercial fishes in some Mediterranean areas. The knowledge of the biology and ecology of this species is poor and geographically limited, then the aim {{of this study is to}} provide a contribution to the knowledge on the reproductive biology of this monoecious deep-sea fish in Sardinian waters. Materials and Methods. In this paper the morphology and the development of the gonads, the mean size at maturity, the monthly evolution in the percent frequency of the maturity stages, and of the indices related to reproduction of the shortnose <b>greeneye</b> were examined. Individuals were caught by trawls, between 270 and 504 m of depth in the Sardinian seas. Results. The ovarian pattern is of an asynchronous type, characterized by releasing of eggs in successive batches. Seven stages of development for the ovary and four for the testis were identified on the basis of macroscopic and histological features. The female portion is the most evident component and shows a later maturation than the male portion. The spawning period is unique and takes place from May to September. Conclusion. The identification of spawning period and the adopted reproductive strategy is essential to obtain a better understanding of its biology and a good management of its fisheries...|$|R
5000|$|The {{species was}} {{identified}} as synonymous with S. mitsukurii in several important taxonomic lists, including {{the first edition of}} Sharks and Rays of Australia in 1994. and the 1984 Sharks of the World. [...] The conspecificity of S. mitsukurii and S. montalbani was based on overlapping ranges and a substantial morphological similarity. In 2006, a description of the Indonesian <b>greeneye</b> spurdog was given in Economically Important Sharks and Rays of Indonesia and given the temporary binomial name Squalus sp. 1 pending clarification of the classification of the species. The species name S. montalbani was revived and applied to this species after further analysis in 2007, based on morphometric differences and differences in the coloration pattern.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Greeneyes</b> are deep-sea aulopiform {{marine fishes}} {{in the small}} family Chlorophthalmidae.

50|$|Aptly {{named after}} their disproportionately large, {{iridescent}} (as well as fluorescent) eyes, <b>greeneyes</b> are slender fish with slightly compressed bodies.

Their coloration ranges from a yellowish to blackish brown, and some species have cryptic blotches.|$|E

40|$|This demo showcases some of {{the results}} {{obtained}} by the <b>GreenEyes</b> project, whose main objective is to enable visual analysis on resource-constrained multimedia sensor networks. The demo features a multi-hop visual sensor network operated by BeagleBones Linux computers with IEEE 802. 15. 4 communication capabilities, and capable of recognizing and tracking objects according to two different visual paradigms. In the traditional compress-then-analyze (CTA) paradigm, JPEG compressed images are transmitted through the network from a camera node to a central controller, where the analysis takes place. In the alternative analyze-then-compress (ATC) paradigm, the camera node extracts and compresses local binary visual features from the acquired images (either locally or in a distributed fashion) and transmits them to the central controller, where {{they are used to}} perform object recognition/tracking. We show that, in a bandwidth constrained scenario, the latter paradigm allows to reach better results in terms of application frame rates, still ensuring excellent analysis performance...|$|E
