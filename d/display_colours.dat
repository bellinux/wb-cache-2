It displays the colour for each spectral reflectance curve and records the calculated trichromatic values and colour numbers {{along with the}} spectral curves.

The spectral data can be introduced manually {{as a series of}} reflectance values at wavelengths measured in different standard illuminants with an arbitrary but fixed increment that must be kept for each spectral curve throughout the creation of the whole database. Therefore, older UV-VIS Spectrophotometers that can’t be interfaced with computers can also be used for creating the database needed for colour matching. Alexis Spectral Data determines the whiteness degree in a less time consuming method, which permits storage and easier handling of the obtained data.|$|E

Some of the conceptual insights of Jens Rasmussen are considered, in addition to other design responses, as means of making progress in the design of better man-machine systems. 1. Perspectives on HCI Following Rasmussen (Rasmussen, 1987; Rasmussen, 1988), we may distinguish three perspectives on human-computer interaction (HCI).

We tested whether crab populations may become cryptic under the influence of bird predation by counting birds overflying or feeding on differently coloured colonies. Colonies with cryptically coloured crabs indeed experience a much higher level of bird presence, compared to colourful colonies. We show in addition that colourful crab individuals subjected to dummy bird predation do change their body colouration over a matter of days. The crabs thus appear to modify their social signalling system depending on their assessment of predation risk...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Colour {{codes are}} used {{extensively}} in railways to convey specific information governing movement of trains and equipment on the track. One such task is the railway traffic control display that uses colour coded video display terminals (VDTs) to convey information {{of the signal}} status, train movements and track status to the railway dispatcher. Because individuals with colour vision deficiencies (colour-defectives) may have problems with these colour-related tasks, questions were raised about the suitability of colour vision defectives to work as railway dispatchers. In order to answer that, a VDT based Dispatch Colour Vision Test based on the actual railway traffic display was developed previously. Purpose The main purpose of this thesis is to establish the pass/fail scores and repeatability of the VDT based Dispatch Colour Vision Test that resulted from the previous work. Secondly, the study will also examine whether clinical colour vision tests can predict the performance on the practical task. Methods The Dispatch colour vision test was divided into three parts based on the colour sets that the dispatcher had to recognize. The testing computer system used the the same RGB colour settings, graphics card and monitor as in railway dispatch centres. Subjects viewed the <b>display</b> <b>colours</b> and entered their responses by using a mouse. One hundred colour-normals and fifty two colour-defectives participated in the initial session. The test was repeated approximately after 10 days. Ninety three colour-normals (93 %) and 44 (85 %) colour-defectives participated in the second session. The total number of errors and time to complete the test was recorded. Results Pass/Fail on the VDT Dispatch colour vision test was based on colour-normal errors. Ignoring orange-red errors, two errors were allowed in the first session and one error was allowed in the second session. Based on this criterion, 42 % of colour vision defectives could perform as well as colour normal subjects. The kappa coefficient of agreement between the sessions for the colour-defectives was 0. 85. Detailed analysis between the colour differences and the errors showed only a weak correlation between the two. However, the general trend was that colour-defectives made more errors on colours that were near or {{along the same lines}} of confusions and the colours were nearly equal in luminance. Nevertheless, the interaction between luminance and location with respect to the lines of confusion was not easy to interpret. The time to complete the task for the colour-defectives who passed the test took 14 % longer than colour-normals and colour-defectives who failed took 30 % longer than colour-normals. All groups showed a similar learning effect with an 18 % reduction in mean times to complete the task at the second session. There was no significant correlation between the number of errors and time to complete or the clinical tests and completion times for any of the groups. Clinical colour vision tests have limited value in predicting performance of colour-defectives on the Dispatch test. Logistic analysis results showed that the Farnsworth D- 15 along with the Nagel was the best predictor of the VDT Dispatch colour test pass/fail results. However, these results were similar to using the Farnsworth D- 15 test alone. Ninety-five percent of the individuals who failed the Farnsworth D- 15 also failed the Dispatch test. However, approximately 25 % of the individuals who passed the Farnsworth D- 15 failed the VDT Dispatch colour test which is an unacceptable false negative rate. These results indicate the Farnsworth D- 15 can only be used to predict who is likely to fail the dispatch test. Conclusions Forty two percent of colour vision defectives could perform as well as colour-normals in identifying VDT railway <b>display</b> <b>colours</b> and time to complete the task. Clinical colour vision tests were inadequate predictors of performance in practical task, overall. However, the Farnsworth D- 15 was a very good predictor of who would fail the VDT Dispatch test. Hence a practical VDT Dispatch test may be needed to test individuals who would want to work as railway dispatchers...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronics}} industry {{today is}} one that stands as a multi-billion dollar industry that is increasingly incorporating more and more products that have ever escalating applications in our everyday life. One of the main sectors of this industry, {{and one that is}} likely to continue expanding for a considerable number of years are flat-panel displays. Traditionally, the displays market has been dominated by cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs) display types. The drawback of such display displays is that they can be bulky, heavy and/or expensive and so there is considerable room for an alternative and superior technology. One possibility is organic semiconductor displays where light-emitting molecules can be dissolved in common solvents before being inkjet printed, spin-coated or even painted onto any surface giving the benefits of simple and cost effective processing. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have recently become ever more evident as a major display type. This thesis focuses on the advancement of light-emitting dendrimers towards flat-panel display applications. The particular interest in dendrimers arises because it has been found they are capable of giving solution-processed phosphorescent devices with high efficiency. Throughout the thesis the benefits of the dendrimer concept are repeatedly shown revealing why this could become the ideal organic material for display applications. The thesis introduces various techniques of electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements before applying such methods to study a large number of light-emitting dendrimers in order to explore the role of intermolecular interactions, how they are related to molecular structure, and how this determines photophysical and charge transporting properties of the dendrimers. By such studies a number of highly efficient solution-processed phosphorescent light-emitting dendrimers have been identified while the efficiency of devices made from these dendrimers has been improved. This has been demonstrated {{in each of the three}} primary <b>display</b> <b>colours</b> of red, green and blue. The work detailed thus brings closer the prospect of dendrimer light-emitting diodes being the future flat-panel display type of choice. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
