40|$|Tö {{determine}} whether, {{and to what}} extent, supplementing visual waterfall <b>displays</b> with redundant auditory signals (i. e., bimodal <b>displays)</b> enhances {{detection of}} sonar targets. This {{study was designed to}} rule out several potential artifacts which complicate the interpretation of previous research on bimodal sonar <b>displays.</b> This study also investigated the extent to which signal uncertainty and the degree of spatial compatibility between visual and auditory signals in bimodal <b>displays</b> affects target detection performance. THE FINDINGS The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which targets were just barely detectable was 1. 1 dB lower for bimodal <b>displays</b> than for single-modality <b>displays.</b> This result is in close agreement with most previous studies of bimodal sonar <b>displays.</b> The results also show that the deterioration in detection performance with increased signal uncertainty is considerably less for auditory <b>displays</b> than for visual <b>displays.</b> In this study, increased spatial compatibility between visual and auditory signals did not facilitate detection on bimodal <b>displays.</b> More effective methods making auditory and visual signals spatially compatible are recommended for further research.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} {{a new class}} of fused image <b>displays</b> called hybrid fused <b>displays.</b> Such <b>displays</b> can be created by gradually transforming a fused image computed by one fusion method into another fused image computed by a different fusion method, either in the spatial domain or in another domain. By defining either global image-to-image or local region-toregion mapping(s) between the two key fused <b>displays,</b> sequences of hybrid fused <b>displays</b> can be generated. In this paper we propose a number of global and local inbetweening algorithms which transform pixel-based fused <b>displays</b> into various region-based fused <b>displays.</b> The main motivation behind this research is that while pixel-based fused <b>displays</b> generally provide better situational awareness, region-based fused <b>displays,</b> such as cut-andpaste <b>displays</b> or pseudo-coloured segmentation maps, often lead to better performance in tasks such as target detection and tracking. Having the ability to generate hybrid <b>displays</b> between these two classes is essential for being able to evaluate their perception, performance and usefulness for various tasks in different scenarios and applications...|$|R
