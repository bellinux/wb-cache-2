Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a <b>discrete</b> <b>phase</b> shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centreline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is antenna gain.

40|$|Using a {{dedicated}} microprobe beam line (X- 26 A NSLS) {{we have conducted}} spatially resolved XRF and XAS studies {{on a variety of}} environmental samples and on samples produced in waste isolation and processing activities. XANES spectroscopy has provided detailed information on the oxidation states of U in contaminated soils on regions as small as 50 µm, with minimal sample manipulation. Qualitative information on bonding environments of U have been deduced based upon elemental associations generated at 10 µm spatial resolution on identical regions where complete XANES spectra were collected and also on the 'fingerprint' or multiple scattering regions of the XANES spectra. Distinct regions within the sediments were found to contain phases of predominately U(VI) and U(IV). On the spatial scale examined, the U(VI) was present both as diffusely distributed and as <b>discrete</b> <b>phases,</b> whereas phases containing predominately U(IV) were present exclusively as <b>discrete</b> <b>phases.</b> Examination of a large population of individual grains prior to and following extraction with a sodium carbonate lixiviant, revealed that the U(IV) phases were highly enriched following extraction, suggesting more selective solubilization of U(VI) phases.

50|$|Strategy {{video games}} are {{categorized}} {{based on whether}} they offer the continuous gameplay of real-time strategy, or the <b>discrete</b> <b>phases</b> of turn-based strategy. These differences in time-keeping lead to several other differences. Typically, turn-based strategy games have stronger artificial intelligence than real-time strategy games, since the turn-based pace allows more time for complex calculations. But a real-time artificial intelligence makes up for this disadvantage with its ability to manage multiple units more quickly than a human. Overall, real-time strategy games are more action-oriented, {{as opposed to the}} abstract planning emphasized in turn-based strategy.|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{the various}} memory {{components}} are encoded {{and how they}} interact to guide behavior requires knowledge of the underlying neural circuits. Currently, aversive olfactory memory in Drosophila is behaviorally subdivided into four <b>discrete</b> <b>phases.</b> Among these, short- and long-term memories rely, respectively, on the γ and α/β Kenyon cells (KCs), two distinct subsets of the ∼ 2, 000 neurons in the mushroom body (MB). Whereas V 2 efferent neurons retrieve memory from α/β KCs, the neurons that retrieve short-term memory are unknown. We identified a specific pair of MB efferent neurons, named M 6, that retrieve memory from γ KCs. Moreover, our network analysis revealed that six <b>discrete</b> memory <b>phases</b> actually exist, three {{of which have been}} conflated in the past. At each time point, two distinct memory components separately recruit either V 2 or M 6 output pathways. Memory retrieval thus features a dramatic convergence from KCs to MB efferent neurons...|$|R
