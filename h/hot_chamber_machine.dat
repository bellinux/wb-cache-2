Painful stimuli such as heat induced by light beam focused on tail and <b>hot</b> plate <b>chamber</b> were applied. Animals were injected with either morphine (0. 5, 5 and 50 mg/ 100 g body weight) or L-NAME (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 mg/ 100 g body weight) intraperitonealy. Changes in tail flick latency and responses to the <b>hot</b> plate <b>chamber</b> were measured in different groups of mice. The tail flick latency was increased significantly in both male and female animals treated with morphine (control male (sec) : 2. 45 ± 0. 16, male which received morphine 50 mg/ 100 g body weight: 13. 5 ± 0. 6, control female: 3. 4 ± 0. 3, female which received morphine 50 mg/ 100 g body weight: 13. 8 ± 0. 6; P< 0. 001 vs control in both cases). The response time to the <b>hot</b> plate <b>chamber</b> was also increased significantly by morphine pretreatment in both male and female mice.

Pretreatment with L-NAME at all concentrations caused a significant non-dose dependent increase in the response time to the <b>hot</b> plate <b>chamber</b> only in the male mice.

40|$|Pressure {{die casting}} is an {{important}} production process. In pressure die casting, the ® rst setting of process parameters is established through guess work. Experts use their previous experience and knowledge to develop a solution for a new application. Due to rapid expansion in the die casting process to produce better quality products {{in a short period}} of time, there is ever increasing demand to replace the time-consuming and expert-reliant traditional trial and error methods of establishing process parameters. A neural network system is developed to generate the process parameters for the pressure die casting process. The system aims to replace the existing high-cost, time-consuming and expertdependent trial and error approach for determining the process parameters. The scope of this work includes analysing a physical model of the pressure die casting ® lling stage based on governing equations of die cavity ® lling and the collection of feasible casting data for the training of the network. The training data were generated by using ZN-DA 3 material on a <b>hot</b> <b>chamber</b> die casting <b>machine</b> with a plunger diameter of 60 mm. The present network was developed using the MATLAB application toolbox. In this work, the neural network was developed by comparing three di€ erent training algorithms: i. e. error backpropagation algorithm; momentum and adaptive learning algorithm; and Levenberg± Marquardt approximation algorithm. It was found that the Levenberg± Marquardt approximation algorithm was the preferred method for this application as it reduced the sum-squared error to a small value. The accuracy of the developed network was tested by comparing the data generated fromthe network with those of an expert froma local die casting industry. It was established that by using this network the selection of process parameters becomes much easier, so that it can be used by a novice user without prior knowledge of the die casting process or optimization techniques. 1. Introduction Pressure die casting {{is an important}} production process that is extensively used to produce castings for the electrical, electronic and automobile industries. The process has its origins in type casting machines developed in 1822. The process showed its production potential as early as the mid 1800 s when it had reached a high level of automation and mechanical efficiency. In 1894, the ® rst die casting machine was developed, in which molten metal was forced through an inclined port and out of the nozzle into the die by the central ram actuated by a lever. During the past two decades, the pressure die casting process has become an essential casting production process for the engineering industry.

Both field and greenhouse screening methods {{have been used to}} test inbred lines for heat stress response, but greenhouse screening has been particularly useful in determining the physiological effects of heat stress. METHODS Eight lima bean inbred lines were grown in two climate controlled chambers inside of the greenhouse under hot and cool night temperature regimes. Experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 5 replications. Target night temperatures were 27 °C in the <b>hot</b> <b>chamber</b> and 18 °C in the cool chamber.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a three-dimensional numerical model {{that is used}} to predict the transient thermal behaviour of the metal injection system of a <b>hot</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure die casting machine. The behaviour of the injection system is considered in conjunction with that of the die. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to model the transient thermal behaviour of the injection system elements and the die blocks. A perturbation approach is adopted. By adopting this approach, only those surfaces over which a significant transient variation in temperature occurs need be considered. The model assumes that a corresponding steady-state analysis has first been performed so that time-averaged thermal information is available. A finite element based technique is used to model the phase change of the liquid metal in the die cavity and in the injection system. At injection the nozzle and die are assumed to be instantly filled with liquid metal, however, a procedure is presented that attempts to model the heat transfer associated with the flow through the nozzle, gate, and runner regions during injection. Model predictions are compared against thermocouple readings and thermal images obtained from experimental tests. Good agreement is obtained between predicted and measured temperatures. The transient thermal behaviour of an existing <b>hot</b> <b>chamber</b> injection system is investigated in detail and recommendations for improved performance are made. In an attempt to improve the solidification pattern of the casting and the thermal behaviour of the injection system, a redesign of the experimental die is considered. The numerical predictions indicate that the redesign will have a beneficial effect on the solidification pattern of the casting, and on the performance of the injection system...|$|R
