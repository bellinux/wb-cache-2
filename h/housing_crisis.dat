In September 1939, the Air Ministry allocated ₤4,500,000 for a new Shadow factory. This government-funded and -operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war. The factory was fully occupied by September 1940. A <b>housing</b> <b>crisis</b> also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national <b>housing</b> <b>crisis</b> that began in 2008. While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether recoveries following normal recessions differ from recoveries following recessions {{that are associated}} with either banking <b>crises</b> or <b>housing</b> <b>crises.</b> Using a parametric panel framework that allows for a bounce-back in the level of output during the recovery, we find that normal recessions are followed by strong recoveries in advanced economies. This bounce-back is absent following recessions associated with banking <b>crises</b> and <b>housing</b> <b>crises.</b> Consequently, the permanent output losses of recessions associated with banking <b>crises</b> and <b>housing</b> <b>crises</b> are considerably larger than those of normal recessions...|$|R

It has a special focus on {{the business cycle}} effects and possible international spillover effects of <b>housing</b> <b>crises.</b> Moreover, it analyzes the economic conditions under which <b>housing</b> <b>crises</b> are particularly costly. It proposes a method of dealing with the problem of heterogeneity that frequently occurs when the effects of severe economic crises are analyzed. Finally, it analyzes the strength of recoveries following recessions associated with severe economic recessions compared to ordinary recessions. The results found are particularly relevant for economic policy and macroeconomic forecasting, and in some cases they also may serve as the empirical foundation for theoretical business cycle models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} statistical {{evidence suggesting}} that in industrial countries, recessions {{that are associated with}} either banking <b>crises</b> or <b>housing</b> <b>crises</b> dampen output far more than ordinary recessions. Using a parametric panel framework that allows for a bounceback of the level of output {{in the course of the}} cyclical recovery, we find that ordinary recessions are followed by strong recoveries that make up for almost all the preceding shortfall in output. This bounceback tends to be significantly smaller following recessions associated with banking <b>crises</b> or <b>housing</b> <b>crises.</b> Our paper corroborates the practice of focusing exclusively on severe crises used in an emerging macroeconomic literature and integrates it with the earlier literature on recessions and recoveries...|$|R

25|$|The Brixton {{area was}} bombed during World War II, {{contributing}} to a severe <b>housing</b> <b>crisis,</b> which in turn led to urban decay. This was followed by slum clearances and the building of council housing. In the 1940s and 1950s, many immigrants, particularly from the West Indies, settled in Brixton. More recent immigrants include a large Portuguese community (see Little Portugal) and other European citizens. Brixton also has an increasingly ageing population, which affects housing strategies in the area.|$|E

40|$|It is now {{well-established}} {{that the}} U. S. <b>housing</b> market <b>crisis</b> preceded {{the labor market}} crisis and that, {{in the wake of}} these crises, doubling-up and cohabitation increased and homeownership fell. What is less clear is what happened at the subnational level. This study reports on: 1) how the length, severity and relative timing of both the labor market and <b>housing</b> <b>crises</b> varied by MSA; and 2) the association between the timing of the labor market and <b>housing</b> <b>crises</b> and changes in homeownership and doubling-up at the MSA level. The analysis is conducted using data on 353 MSAs, with a focus on 12 MSAs, for the period 2005 (pre-crisis) through 2010 / 2011. MSAs are categorized into those where the housing market declined first, those where the labor market declined first, and those where the events were concurrent. The analysis reveals that: 1) in the majority of MSAs, the labor market declined first, contrary to the national pattern and the experience of the vast majority of large MSAs; 2) there is a clear relationship between greater regional housing distress and falling homeownership rates; and 3) somewhat surprisingly, the association between changes in doubling-up and these crises are fairly weak at the MSA level...|$|R
25|$|Around {{the edges}} of south eastern towns, {{perfectly}} good agricultural land often remains uncultivated {{as a result of}} price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the <b>housing</b> <b>crisis</b> (see below).

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade after 2000, a <b>housing</b> <b>crisis</b> began in Auckland with the market not being able to sustain the demand for {{affordable}} homes. The Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 mandated that a minimum of 10 per cent of new builds in certain housing areas be subsidized to make them affordable for buyers who had incomes on par with the national average. In a new subdivision at Hobsonville Point, 20 per cent of new homes were reduced to below $550,000. Some of the demand for new housing at this time was attributed to the 43,000 people who moved into Auckland between June 2014 and June 2015.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 <b>housing</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Poor {{service user}} {{experiences}} are often reported {{on mental health}} inpatient wards. <b>Crisis</b> <b>houses</b> are an alternative, but evidence is limited. This paper investigates therapeutic alliances in acute wards and <b>crisis</b> <b>houses,</b> exploring how far stronger therapeutic alliance may underlie greater client satisfaction in <b>crisis</b> <b>houses.</b> Methods and Findings: Mixed methods were used. In the quantitative component, 108 <b>crisis</b> <b>house</b> and 247 acute ward service users responded to measures of satisfaction, therapeutic relationships, informal peer support, recovery and negative events experienced during the admission. Linear regressions were conducted to estimate the association between service setting and measures, and to model the factors associated with satisfaction. Qualitative interviews exploring therapeutic alliances were conducted with service users and staff in each setting and analysed thematically. Results: We found that therapeutic alliances, service user satisfaction and informal peer support were greater in <b>crisis</b> <b>houses</b> than on acute wards, whilst self-rated recovery and numbers of negative events were lower. Adjusted multivariable analyses suggest that therapeutic relationships, informal peer support and negative experiences related to staff may be important factors in accounting for greater satisfaction in <b>crisis</b> <b>houses.</b> Qualitative results suggest factors that influence therapeutic alliances include service user perceptions of basic human qualities such as kindness and empathy in staff and, a...|$|R
