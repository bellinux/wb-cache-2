5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5|$|Structures {{differ from}} {{buildings}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> functional constructions {{meant to be}} used for purposes other than sheltering human activity. Examples include an aircraft, a grain elevator, a gazebo, and a bridge.|$|E
5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E
50|$|All Hail the Silence and the {{subsequent}} album <b>are</b> notable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> created using analog synthesizers {{without the aid of}} a computer.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{said that}} both incidents <b>were</b> alike, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> theft-type offenses involving group action and intimidating conduct {{by members of}} the group.|$|R
40|$|An {{individual}} genotype of {{aldehyde dehydrogenase}} 2 (ALDH 2) was observed when using nail clippings and saliva, respectively by the method consisting of DNA extraction, genomic DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction, and gel electrophoresis of DNA fragment. Gene analysis using fingernail DNA {{was found to}} <b>be</b> effective <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> easily to collect from human samples, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> kept storable at – 80 ℃ until use, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> DNA <b>in</b> the sample was very stable after repeated treatment of freezing and thawing...|$|R
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> of similar size {{and have a}} hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two}} groups are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Departure {{times for}} these flights as {{specified}} during booking are by definition approximate, with the settlement service optimised {{on the fly}} depending on local demand for a given day. Settlement flights in the Disko Bay region are unique <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> operated only during winter and spring. During summer and autumn, transport between settlements is only by sea, with services operated by Diskoline, a government-contracted ferry service based in Ilulissat.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition {{is intended to be}} expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E
50|$|Eutrichiurides {{species were}} very similar in form and build to modern snake mackerels, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> long and slender, blade-shaped fishes with {{elongated}} jaws possessing fangs and needle-shaped teeth.|$|R
50|$|Martians in the Life on Mars theme <b>were</b> unique <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{named after}} real-life stars and constellations: Altair, Centauri, Antares, Canopus, Pollux, Vega, Arcturus, Cassiopeia, Mizar, and Rigel.|$|R
25|$|Rynkeby Church in the {{northeast}} corner of Funen has a series of interesting paintings depicting angels playing a wide variety of musical instruments. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> exceptional <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> painted after the Reformation.|$|R
5|$|The Greater New York Councils {{are unique}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> divided into five boroughs with each {{led by a}} borough Scout {{executive}} and each borough then divided into districts. Similarly, due to Scouting population and geographic distance, the Utah National Parks Council is divided into 12 Sectors with each led by a volunteer assistant vice president and assistant council commissioner with each sector then divided into districts.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy {{to take in the}} morning sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of}} the ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|E
50|$|Crate footlockers {{were more}} crude than plywood footlockers <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> either {{made out of}} old ammo and packing crates, or {{followed}} along similar packing crate designs for simplicity and expediency of manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The East Melanesian Islands {{have many}} plants and some animals whose {{ancestors}} arrived from neighboring New Guinea and New Caledonia, but {{differ from those}} islands <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> never joined to a continent.|$|R
50|$|The bells <b>are</b> unusual <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> cast untuned, <b>they</b> ring {{anti-clockwise}} {{instead of}} clockwise, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to be}} the only ring of eight bells cast by Murphy which are still in operation today.|$|R
5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
50|$|The Pleasures of the Imagination {{may also}} refer to The Spectator papers {{numbered}} 411 through 418. These specific papers {{differed from the}} rest <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> non-narrative and philosophical, and contained less obvious social commentary.|$|R
50|$|Alexandra and {{her sister}} were unique among British princesses <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> descended from both William IV (through his mistress, Dorothea Jordan), and William IV's niece, Queen Victoria, who succeeded him {{because he had no}} {{legitimate}} issue.|$|R
2500|$|The French Aviation Militaire <b>was</b> {{fortunate}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to standardise on two reasonably satisfactory synchronization gears – one {{adapted for}} rotary engines, {{and the other}} for [...] "stationary" [...] (in-line) ones – almost from the beginning.|$|R
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|Excluding Kingston upon Hull {{there are}} several areas of {{settlement}} in the East Riding, each giving rise to distinctive types of small to medium-sized towns and villages. Cottingham and Willerby are exceptional <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> suburban villages which are almost contiguous with the Hull urban area. Bridlington is the most populous of the coastal settlements, which also include Flamborough, Hornsea, Withernsea and Aldbrough. Towns and villages on the flat agricultural area of Holderness are Hedon and Roos, and nestling in the Great Wold Valley is Rudston. Along the eastern foot of the Wolds lie Beverley, Bishop Burton, Driffield and Lockington. In the low-lying lands close to the Humber Estuary are Goole, Brough, North Ferriby, Hessle and Kirk Ella. Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Market Weighton, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Howden and South Cave all lie {{to the north and}} west of the area, between the River Derwent and the scarp slope of the Wolds.|$|E
5|$|Six {{vascular}} {{plants are}} unique <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{at the extreme}} edge of their range or are disjunct from the main range of their species. They are the Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes L.), in Minnesota six small populations of 20 to 40 plants {{have been found in}} the Rove area; Ross's (or Short) sedge (Carex rossii), only three populations are known to exist in the Rove area; Large-leaved sandwort (Moehringia macrophylla or Arenaria macrophylla), evidence indicates {{that this is a very}} rare species with limited distribution and restrictive environmental needs; Sticky locoweed (Oxytropis borealis var. viscida), is restricted to a single cliff in Cook County; Encrusted saxifrage (Saxifraga paniculata ssp. neogaea), 11 populations are known to exist in the Rove formation; and Smooth Woodsia (Woodsia glabella), there are small, isolated populations in the Rove Formation.|$|E
2500|$|Rhett and Link also {{produced}} segments for Phil Vischer's [...] "What's in the Bible". <b>In</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a singing duo named [...] "The Fabulous Bentley Brothers" [...] performing teaching songs about different books, or topics, in the Bible.|$|R
50|$|Both moral {{insanity}} and monomania were {{depicted in}} Victorian novels and {{movies of the}} time. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> similar <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> both abnormalities of an otherwise normal mind, though the former was a systemic malfunction and the latter an isolated aberration.|$|R
50|$|As {{indicated}} by the name, the Anti-Americans differed from previous incarnations of Team Canada <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> anti-American rather than pro-Canadian. As a result of this, the emblem of the stable was not the Canadian flag, but an American flag flown upside down.|$|R
5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
25|$|Ents {{are similar}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> expensive, rarely used warriors.|$|E
25|$|Variables are {{denoted by}} a string {{consisting}} of letters, numbers and underscore characters, and beginning with an upper-case letter or underscore. Variables closely resemble variables in logic <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> placeholders for arbitrary terms.|$|E
500|$|HMS Unrivalled {{was one of}} {{the second}} group of U-class {{submarines}} ordered on 23 August 1940. These submarines differed from their predecessors <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lengthened by [...] "to give a more streamlined shape aft and to improve the flow of water over the propellers." ...|$|R
50|$|Flower’s Island {{is one of}} the {{communities}} that comprise an area on the northeast coast of the Island of Newfoundland, called Bonavista North. These communities have a shared history <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> settled by people from England, predominantly from the West Country—Dorset, Devon Somerset and Hampshire.|$|R
50|$|The {{admiralty}} divisions {{should be}} not confused with its departments which were distinct and {{separate from the}} function of the naval staff <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> superintended by the offices of the various Sea Lords responsible for them and were primarily administrative and logistical support bodies.|$|R
