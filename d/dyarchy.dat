5|$|Following the Montague-Chelmsford {{reforms of}} 1919, Madras {{was the first}} {{province}} of British India to implement a system of <b>dyarchy,</b> and thereafter its Governor ruled alongside a prime minister. In {{the early decades of}} the 20th century, many significant contributors to the Indian independence movement came from Madras. With the advent of Indian independence on 15 August 1947, the Presidency became the Madras Province. Madras was later admitted as Madras State, a state of the Indian Union at the inauguration of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950, and was reorganised in 1953 & 1956.|$|E
5|$|A <b>dyarchy</b> {{was created}} in Madras Presidency in 1920 as per the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms with {{provisions}} made for elections in the presidency. Democratically elected governments would henceforth share power with the Governor's autocratic establishment. Following the first elections held in November 1920, the Justice Party, an organisation established in 1916 to campaign for increased representation of non-Brahmins in the administration, came to power. A. Subbarayalu Reddiar became the first Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency but resigned soon after due to declining health {{and was replaced by}} P. Ramarayaningar, Minister of Local Self-Government and Public Health, popularly known as the Raja of Panagal. The party split in late 1923 when C. R. Reddy resigned from primary membership and formed a splinter group allied with the opposition Swarajists. A motion of no-confidence was proposed against Ramarayaningar's government on 27 November 1923, but was defeated 65–44. Ramarayaningar remained in power until November 1926. The enactment in August 1921 of the first communal Government Order (G.O. No. 613), which introduced caste-based communal reservations in government jobs, remains one of the high points of his rule. In the following elections of 1926 the Justice Party lost. However, as no party was able to obtain a clear majority, the Governor, Lord Goschen, set up a cross-party government under the leadership of P. Subbarayan and nominated its supporting members. In the election of 1930, the Justice Party was victorious, and P. Munuswamy Naidu became Chief Minister. The exclusion of Zamindars from the Ministry split the Justice Party once again. Fearing a no-confidence motion against him, Munuswamy Naidu resigned in November 1932 and the Raja of Bobbili was appointed Chief Minister in his place. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister of Madras Presidency.|$|E

25|$|The present State of Tamil Nadu is a residuary {{part of the}} {{erstwhile}} Madras Presidency and {{was formerly}} known as Madras State. The first legislature of any sort for the Presidency was the Madras Legislative Council which was set up as a non-representative advisory body in 1861. In 1919, direct elections were introduced {{with the introduction of}} Diarchy under the Government of India Act of 1919. Between 1920-1937, the Legislative Council was a unicameral legislature for the Madras Presidency. The Government of India Act of 1935 abolished <b>dyarchy</b> and created a bicameral legislature in the Madras Presidency. The Legislative Assembly became the Lower House of the Presidency.|$|E
25|$|British India's Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1919, {{enacted in}} 1921, {{expanded}} the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members {{to include more}} elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of <b>dyarchy,</b> whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved {{with members of the}} Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were Surendranath Banerjee (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921-1924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927-1928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and A. K. Fazlul Huq (Education 1924). Bhupendra Nath Bose and Sir Abdur Rahim were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.|$|E
25|$|The {{term of the}} {{legislature}} expired on 5 November 1933. However, the elections to the Madras Legislative Council were delayed by a year. Meanwhile, the Indian National Congress had decided {{to participate in the}} elections at a meeting in Patna in May 1934 and hence, when the elections took place in November 1934, the Justice Party lost miserably. However, the Raja of Bobbili adopted contingency measures by immediately convening a meeting and conducting negotiations between the different factions of the party. The Swarajya Party which won a majority in the Assembly once again refused to form the government in accordance with its policy of wrecking the <b>dyarchy.</b> So, the Raja of Bobbili was elected Chief Minister for a second term though he did not command the majority of the house.|$|E
25|$|The Government of India Act of 1935 {{abolished}} <b>dyarchy</b> and ensured provincial autonomy. It {{created a}} bicameral legislature in the Madras province. The Legislature {{consisted of the}} Governor and two Legislative bodies - a Legislative Assembly and a Legislative Council. The Assembly consisted of 215 members, who were further classified into general members and reserved members representing special communities and interests. The Council consisted of a minimum of 54 and a maximum of 56 members. It was a permanent body not subject to dissolution by the Governor and one-third of its members retired every three years. 46 of its members were elected directly by the electorate while the Governor could nominate 8 to 10 members. Similar to the council, the electable members were further classified into general and reserved members. Specific number of seats were reserved (allocated) to various religious and ethnic groups. The Act provided for a limited adult franchise based on property qualifications. Seven million people, roughly 15% of the Madras people holding land or paying urban taxes were qualified to be the electorate. Under this Act, two councils were constituted - the first in 1937 and the second in 1946. Both Councils were controlled by Congress majorities.|$|E

500|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the {{population}} of Madras necessitated the expansion {{of the city and the}} creation of more residential colonies. To fulfill this requirement, the Madras Town Planning Act of 1920 had been passed on 7 September 1920 before the <b>dyarchy</b> was established. As per the provisions of this Act, numerous town planning measures were taken during the tenure of the Raja of Panagal. The [...] long and [...] broad Long Tank, which extended from Nungambakkam to Saidapet, forming an arc along the city's western frontier, was drained out in 1923. The development of the tract to the west of the Long Tank had been initiated by the British Government in 1911 with the construction of a railway station at the village of Marmalan or Mambalam. Following the draining out of the Long Tank, the Justice Party government of the Raja of Panagal conceived the creation of a residential colony adjoining this little village.|$|E

His party won 35 seats in the Bengal Legislative Assembly during the Indian provincial elections, 1937. It was the third largest party after the Bengal Congress and Bengal Provincial Muslim League. The Congress refused to form government due to its pan-Indian policy of boycotting legislatures. Huq formed a coalition with the Bengal Provincial Muslim League and independent legislators. He was elected as the Leader of the House and the 1st Prime Minister of Bengal.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{election}} for the Madras Legislative Council, under this Act {{was held in}} November 1920. The first sitting of the Council was inaugurated by the Duke of Connaught on 12 January 1921. In total, five such councils were constituted (in 1920, 23, 26, 30 and 34). The term of the councils was three years (except for the fourth council which was extended for a year in expectation of abolition of <b>dyarchy</b> [...] ). While the first, second and fourth Councils were controlled by Justice Party majorities, the third Council was characterised by a fractured verdict and an independent ministry.

About a century later, its unity was finally shattered by the aggressive in Persia based rivalling Turkic federations; the Kara Koyunlu, and the Ak Koyunlu. By 1490/91, the once powerful monarchy fragmented into three independent kingdoms – Kartli (central to eastern Georgia), Kakheti (eastern Georgia), and Imereti (western Georgia) – each led by a rival branch of the Bagrationi dynasty, and into five semi-independent principalities – Odishi, Mingrelia, Guria, Abkhazia, Svaneti, and Samtskhe – dominated by their own feudal clans.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the {{recommendations}} of the Montague-Chelmsford report, the Government of India Act of 1919 was enacted. The Act enlarged the provincial legislative councils and increased the strength of elected members to be greater than that of nominated and official members. It introduced a system of <b>dyarchy</b> in the Provinces. Although this Act brought about representative Government in India, the Governor was empowered with overriding powers. It classified the subjects as belonging to either the Centre or the Provinces. The Governor General could override any law passed by the Provincial councils. It brought about the concept of [...] "Partial Responsible Government" [...] in the provinces. Provincial subjects were divided into two categories - reserved and transferred. Education, Sanitation, Local self-government, Agriculture and Industries were listed as the transferred subjects. Law, Finance, Revenue and Home affairs were the reserved subjects. The provincial council could decide the budget in so far it related to the transferred subjects. Executive machinery dealing with those subjects was placed under the direct control of provincial legislature. However, the provincial legislature and the ministers did not have any control over the reserved subjects, which came under the Governor and his Executive council.|$|E

The Justice party was split between the Zamindari and the non-Zamindari factions which struggled for power. The Zamindari faction eventually won and its leader, the Raja of Bobbili, became the chief minister in November 1932 replacing P. Munuswamy Naidu. His pro-land owner economic policies amidst the Great Depression were hugely unpopular.

The Civil Disobedience movement, the Land Tax reduction agitations and Union organizations helped the Congress to mobilize popular opposition to the Bobbili Raja government.
