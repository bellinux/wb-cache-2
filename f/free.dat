5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly <b>free</b> (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no <b>free</b> creatures at all. Now God can create <b>free</b> creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly <b>free</b> after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the <b>free</b> creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that <b>free</b> creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.

5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a <b>free</b> black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – <b>free</b> people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was <b>free.</b> Most African-American families had both <b>free</b> and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E

5|$|<b>Free</b> basic water. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua Potable) available to their poorest residents <b>free</b> of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for <b>free</b> to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance <b>free</b> basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of <b>free</b> basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households.

For the first billion years, any <b>free</b> oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, <b>free</b> oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E

50|$|Another {{existing}} {{use of the}} fideicommissum is described in G 2.263-266: libertas quoque servo per fideicommissum dari potest if the heres or legatarius is requested to perform the manumissio to become the patronus of the slave so <b>freed.</b> <b>Freeing</b> slaves was attractive for the dominus for several reasons. Firstly, he could get rid of slaves who were of no use to him (because they were thugs, uneducated or incapable of working). Secondly, a <b>freed</b> slave owed the dominus who <b>freed</b> him honor et sequi, including the procession to the grave. This led to {{a great number of}} slaves being <b>freed</b> on the death bed. Rome was gradually crowding with <b>freed</b> slaves, enlarging the poor classes within society. Therefore Augustus passed laws against luxury. They restricted liberation of slaves, but could be partly evaded by the fideicommissum. The fideicommissum also gave way to granting the rights of a patronus to the person who was committed to <b>freeing</b> the slave.|$|R

40|$|<b>Freeing</b> ports {{on fishing}} vessels are a {{significant}} safety feature. They are designed to reduce the build up of green water on deck {{that may lead to}} loss of stability. At a more mundane level they reduce wetness on decks that are the working platforms for the fishers. Wet decks that are moving working platforms are clearly a hazard. The present study deals more with the build up of water on deck rather than just general deck wetness. It attempts to quantify the amount of water on deck for different <b>freeing</b> port configurations, using parameters such as number of <b>freeing</b> ports, <b>freeing</b> port areas, deck area etc. The study uses numerical simulations to evaluate these parameters. One particular vessel has been used throughout the study, namely a typical fibreglass 65 foot fishing vessel of recent design. The main conclusions of the study are that generally there is not a great deal of difference between the amounts of water on deck for the different <b>freeing</b> port configurations. Although larger <b>freeing</b> ports allow more water on deck if the ingress and egress of water flowing through the <b>freeing</b> ports is unhindered in both directions, for <b>freeing</b> ports fitted with some device (such as 2 ̆ 018 flaps 2 ̆ 019) that hinders the in-flow but not the out-flow then having larger <b>freeing</b> ports is shown to be beneficial. The benefits here are more to do with stability than general deck wetness. It is in fact clear from some of the results that larger <b>freeing</b> ports lead to wetter decks. The motions of the vessel in the study with water on deck have been evaluated and it is shown that different <b>freeing</b> port configurations can lead to different motions of the vessel, particularly {{in the early stages of}} flooding.

5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the <b>Free</b> Trade Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the <b>Free</b> Trade Unions. This panel demanded that the <b>Free</b> Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the <b>Free</b> Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the <b>Free</b> Trade Unions.|$|E
