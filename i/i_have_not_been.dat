5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E

25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, it was {{revealed}} on-screen that Dylan {{is in fact the}} long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: [...] "I love this story! Now, I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out, but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular. That’s all you need; good actors performing a good script, and our fabulous new directing team, and I love them all. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> this happy at work in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in the investigation, an {{additional}} $4,000 fine was imposed on Monteiro. The coach had {{a salary of}} only about $1,500 per month during the eight months he spent with the Rainmen. He was unable to contact team owner Andre Levingston, who did not assist or help him. Monteiro responded to the charges by claiming that they were unfair. In a statement on May 11, he said, [...] "I am looking for help to fight these unjust sanctions and fines so I can continue to work {{and be able to}} support my family. The investigation was not full. The truth of what happened is being ignored. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> contacted by any league representative." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been,</b> but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts. The Symphony is written in four movements, as per your program, although—forgive me—as much as I wanted to, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to keep all the keys and modulations you suggested ... It is of course dedicated to you".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, a 1967 letter {{surfaced}} in which Lennon {{wrote to a}} fan saying the Beatles [...] "were lucky to have met" [...] the Maharishi. A 2011 article in The Telegraph reported Harrison as saying: [...] "Maharishi only ever did good for us, and although <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> with him physically, I never left him". [...] In 2007, a Canadian actress, Maggie Blue O'Hara, announced plans to renovate and convert the property into {{a home for the}} street children of New Delhi. In 2011, a plan was announced by the state government to build an Ayush Gram on the site. In 2003, Jerry Hall produced a series for the BBC titled Gurus, which included interviews with TM initiates, Jagger, and Cooke de Herrera, and a visit to the ashram in Rishikesh. Saltzman's photographs at the ashram have subsequently been displayed in galleries worldwide, published in two books and in a permanent exhibition above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Mira Nair began work on a documentary film about the Beatles' visit to India; although no date for the film release has been announced.|$|E

500|$|The {{airborne}} {{assault on the}} three bridges and Fort Eben-Emael had been an overall success for the Fallschirmjäger of Sturmabteilung Koch; the artillery pieces possessed by Fort Eben-Emael had been disabled, {{and two of the}} three bridges designated to be captured by the sub-units of Sturmabteilung Koch had been captured before they could be destroyed. The capture of the bridges, and the neutralization of the artillery pieces in the Fort allowed infantry and armour from the 18th Army to bypass other Belgian defences and enter the heart of Belgium. In a post-war publication, General Kurt Student wrote of the operation, and the efforts of Group Granite in particular, that [...] "It was a deed of exemplary daring and decisive significance [...] I have studied the history of the last war and the battles on all fronts. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to find anything among the host of brilliant actions—undertaken by friend or foe—that could be said to compare with the success achieved by Koch's Assault Group." [...] A number of officers and non-commissioned officers were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for their participation in the operation, including Lieutenant Rudolf Witzig who led the assault on Fort Eben-Emael in the absence of Koch. Sturmabteilung Koch was expanded after the end of Fall Gelb to become 1st Battalion of the newly formed 1st Airlanding Assault Regiment, which itself consisted of four battalions of Fallschirmjaeger trained as a gliderborne assault force. Hauptmann Koch was promoted to the rank of Major for his part in the operation and assumed command of the 1st Battalion. Due to the destroyed bridges, the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion built a new bridge over the canal on 15 September 1944.|$|E
2500|$|I {{can easily}} rest this case upon {{the fact that}} the persons injured were of the colored race, and {{therefore}} peculiarly within the protection of the thirteenth amendment. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to satisfy my mind that this amendment makes a permanent distinction between negroes and persons of [...] other races. Its benefits extend to all persons of all races.|$|E
2500|$|Large authors lists have {{attracted}} some criticism. One commentator wrote, [...] "In more than 25 years {{working as a}} scientific editor ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> aware of any valid argument {{for more than three}} authors per paper, although I recognize that this may not be true for every field." [...] The rise of shared authorship has been attributed to Big Science—scientific experiments that require collaboration and specialization of many individuals.|$|E

2500|$|Senna {{was often}} quoted as using driving {{as a means}} for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life: [...] "The harder I push, the more I find within myself.

2500|$|Although Ryelandt wrote a {{great deal}} of vocal music, his ideal was {{absolute}} music. But there was an ideal beyond that. For Ryelandt, music was a religious vocation.

I have done what I could. The future will decide if anything of this work will survive me to the greater glory of God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} of [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", {{as well as}} tension between him and Rose, led Slash to quit the band officially in October 1996.

We tried to collaborate, but at this point, I'm {{no longer in the}} band." [...] Slash also stated, [...] "Axl's whole visionary style, as far as his input in Guns N' Roses, is completely different from mine. I just like to play guitar, write a good riff, go out there and play, as opposed to presenting an image." ...|$|E
