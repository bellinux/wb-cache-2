40|$|Lecoutre (1991) {{has pointed}} out an error in the Huynh and Feldt (1976) formula for e used to adjust the degree of freedom for an {{approximate}} test in repeated measures designs with two or more independent groups. The present simulation study confirms that Lecoutre's corrected e yields less biased estimation of population e and reduces Type I error rates when compared to Huynh and Feldt's (1976) e. The increased accuracy in Type I errors for group-treatment interactions may become substantial when sam-ple sizes {{are close to the}} number of treatment levels. Repeated measures designs involving two or more independent groups (split-plot designs) are among the most widely used experimental designs in behavioral research (Kirk, 1982). In these designs, each subject is measured at several different times (or after several treatments), and two or more independent groups are involved in the experiment. The experimenter is usually interested in the treatment effect and the group-treatment interac-tion effect. The traditional analysis of variance approach to these designs with one treatment (within subject) factor yields three F values for evaluating the group effect, the treatment effect, and the group-treatment interaction, re-spectively. Two error terms are used to form the F ratios, one with N — g degrees of freedom for the group effect, and the other with (t- N- g) degrees of freedom for the treatment effect and the interaction effect, where g is the number of groups, t the levels of the within-subject treatment, and N the total number of subjects. Computational details can be found in many standard textbooks (e. g., Kirk, 1982). The ANOVA approach for repeated measures designs with g> 2 and one treatment factor requires the following assumptions: (a) Each score in the population is the sum of the population grand mean, the treatment effect, and random error (i. e., a linear model); (b) all measures for treatments are normally distributed; (c) every unit within a distribution and across distribu-tions of different groups is independent; (d) the population covariance matrices for all treatments are the same across groups; and (<b>e)</b> <b>the</b> <b>differ...</b>|$|E

To {{analyze the}} effect of aging on {{sentence}} auditory comprehension and to study the relationship between this language skill and cognitive functions (attention, working memory, and executive functions). Methods. A total of 90 healthy subjects were divided into three groups: adults (50 – 59 years), young-old (60 – 69 years), and old-old (70 – 80 years). Subjects were assessed using the Revised Token Test. The measures used for performance analysis were number of correct answers (accuracy) and execution time of commands on the different subtests. Results. Regarding accuracy, groups showed similar performance on the first blocks, but the young-old and old-old performed worse than adults on blocks 9 and 10. With respect to execution time, groups differed from block 2 (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>the</b> groups <b>differed</b> for all blocks, except for block 1), with the worst performance observed in the old-old group, followed by that of the young-old group.

Yet, while the dependence on pre-existing recordings challenges traditional notions of authorship, it also results in unavoidable legal and financial implications for sampling composers who, increasingly, seek alternative ways to infuse the sample-based method with authentic content. But what are the challenges inherent in attempting to compose new content - inspired by traditional forms - while adhering to Rap’s unique sonic rationale, aesthetics and methodology?

We apply the Kubo formalism {{to obtain the}} thermal (κ) and electrical (σ) conductivities {{as well as an}} update of the shear viscosity (η) by evaluating the corresponding equilibrium two-point correlation functions to leading order in the 1 /N_c expansion. The Dirac structure of the self-energies and spectral functions is taken into account as these are evaluated from the meson-exchange Fock diagrams for on-mass-shell quarks. We find that the thermal and electrical conductivities are decreasing functions of temperature and density above the Mott temperature T_ M of dissolution of mesons into quarks, the main contributions being generated by the temporal and vector components of the spectral functions. The coefficients show a universal dependence on the ratio T/T_ M for different densities, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>the</b> results <b>differ</b> by a chemical-potential dependent constant.

In the experiment, we test our method and compare it with other node placement methods under various settings and environments.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} underlying three prezygotic isolation barriers between the corn- and the rice-strain of the noctuid moth Spodoptera frugiperda to determine possible interactions between these isolation barriers and their relative importance for sympatric speciation. First, we investigated {{the role of}} host plant differentiation as isolation barrier between the two strains. Our analysis shows that, although there is some host-associated genetic structure, host plant differentiation alone cannot explain the total genetic variance and thus other, additional factors must maintain the genetic differentiation. Second, we focused on differentiation in sexual communication between the two strains. Females emit a strain-specific sex pheromone blend, but males do not show a preference for the blend of their own strain. The third and most consistent prezygotic isolation barrier between the two strains is allochronic differentiation, i. <b>e.</b> <b>the</b> strains <b>differ</b> in <b>the</b> daily timing of their sexual activities. We found one major QTL for the circadian differentiation, the circadian clock gene vrille maps to this locus, which is thus the major candidate gene underlying this circadian differentiation. Finally, I discuss the evolutionary potential of the different isolation barriers and I propose an interaction between all prezygotic mating barriers which facilitate the divergence of the two strains, with allochronic differentiation being the driving force. In conclusion, by investigating the prezygotic isolation barriers between two sympatric strains of S. frugiperda in detail, I have determined their strengths and possible interactions, giving insights in the mechanisms underlying and facilitating the process of sympatric speciation...|$|R

The available techniques are either non-robust (i. <b>e.</b> <b>the</b> predicted error <b>differs</b> by orders of magnitude from the exact error) or computationally involved (i. <b>e.</b> requiring <b>the</b> solution of additional partial differential equations). The variational multiscale approach [1, 2] offers a fresh point of departure to set up new strategies for the development of efficient and accurate a-posteriori error estimators [3]. This approach has been shown exact for the class of edge-exact solutions [4] and delivers the error in any norm of choice. It is therefore very well suited for hyperbolic solutions computed with stabilized methods. In this paper the previous work is extended to multi-dimensional flows. In particular, adequate norms are proposed for the computation of the error and the proper error intrinsic scales are calculated for the bilinear quad and the linear triangle. Furthermore, the element-interface error along the element edges is considered in the model. Although in multi-dimensions the proposed explicit a-posteriori error estimator is not exact nor a strict upper bound, it will be shown that, when computing flows with stabilized methods, it is very accurate and economical, leading to efficiencies close to one...|$|R

A range of classical capital theories including Modigliani-Miller (M-M) irrelevance theory, the trade-off, pecking-order and agency theories, are deployed to explore and predict the signs and significance of each determinant pointed out by Titman and Wessels (1988) and Harris and Raviv (1991). In the investigation, we first employ the static panel-data models of the debt ratio, while profitability and firm uniqueness are negatively associated with leverage. In addition, we also find {{a positive relationship between}} earnings volatility and leverage, which, although counterintuitive, is consistent with the argument proposed by Myers (1977) and Donnelly (1993) that risky firms with less agency cost may be more aggressive on debt-financing than others. Further, two conflicting estimates of parameters are found (i. <b>e.</b> <b>the</b> estimated signs <b>differ</b> across regression specifications) : the impacts of non-debt tax shields and growth opportunities. The sign of these relationships indicate that both the trade-off and pecking order theories offer sound explanations for the capital structure of UK listed companies.

40|$|Abstract: Here are the {{arguments}} that show why unification of the classical General Theory of Relativity (GR) and the quantum Standard Model (SM) is impossible. The term “force” {{does not mean the}} same in these two basic theories. The unification of these two basic theories is impossible due to the different properties of the two parallel spacetimes one associated with the GR and the second with SM. Origin of such splitting/bifurcation follows from the internal structure of the Einstein-spacetime components. Since the size of the Einstein-spacetime components is close to the Planck length so the origin of the splitting/bifurcation concerns the sizes smaller than the Planck length. In both theories we neglect internal structure of bare particles so there appear singularities and infinite energies of fields. This causes that within the GR and SM we cannot understand the fundamental differences between classical and quantum theories. The same concerns the string/M theory because this theory starts from wrong initial conditions i. <b>e.</b> objects of <b>the</b> Planck size are not some simple loops/closed-strings. They look as a miniature of an active galaxy, for example, the NGC 4261. There is the torus and ball in its centre.

We propose and evaluate two complementary methods for item-based recommendation: one based on the visual descriptors of the deep neural network, the other based on the content-based attributes of persons. The initial evaluation made by forensic technicians shows that although results favored visual descriptors over attribute-based similarity, both approaches are functional and highly diverse in terms of recommended objects. Thus, future work should involve incorporating both approaches in a single prediction method, preference learning based on the feedback from forensic technicians and recommendation of assembled lineups instead of single candidates...|$|R

Osteoporosis {{is a growing}} healthcare burden that affects {{the quality of life}} in the aging population. Vitamin E is a potential prophylactic agent that can impede the progression of osteoporosis. Various in vivo studies demonstrated the antiosteoporotic potential of vitamin E, but evidence on its molecular mechanism of action is limited. A few in vitro studies showed that various forms of vitamin <b>E</b> can affect <b>the</b> receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) signaling and their molecular targets, thus preventing the formation of osteoclasts in the early stage of osteoclastogenesis. Various studies have also shown that the effects of the different isoforms of vitamin <b>E</b> <b>differ.</b> <b>The</b> effects of single isoforms and combinations of isoforms on bone metabolism are also different. Vitamin E may affect bone metabolism by disruption of free radical-mediated RANKL signaling, by its oestrogen-like effects, by its effects on the molecular mechanism of bone formation, by the anti-inflammatory effects of its long-chain metabolites on bone cells, and by the inhibition of 3 -hydroxyl- 3 -methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). In conclusion, <b>the</b> vitamin <b>E</b> isoforms have enormous potential to be used as prophylactic and therapeutic agents in preventing osteoporosis, but further studies should be conducted to elucidate their mechanisms of action. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} normal and superconducting state {{properties}} of the unconventional triplet superconductor Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4 {{with an emphasis on}} the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and the role played by strong electronic correlations. In particular, we show that the magnetic activity arises from the itinerant electrons in the Ru d-orbitals and a strong magnetic anisotropy occurs (χ^+- < χ^zz) due to spin-orbit coupling. The latter results mainly from different values of the g-factor for the transverse and longitudinal components of the spin susceptibility (i. <b>e.</b> <b>the</b> matrix elements <b>differ).</b> Most importantly, this anisotropy and the presence of incommensurate antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic fluctuations have strong consequences for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. In particular, reviewing spin fluctuation-induced Cooper-pairing scenario in application to Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4 we show how p-wave Cooper-pairing with line nodes between neighboring RuO_ 2 -planes may occur. We also discuss the open issues in Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4 like the influence of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities on the superconducting and normal state of Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4. It is clear that the physics of triplet superconductivity in Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4 is still far from being understood completely and remains to be analyzed more in more detail. It is of interest to apply the theory also to superconductivity in heavy-fermion systems exhibiting spin fluctuations. Comment: short review article.
