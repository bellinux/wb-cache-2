50|$|The {{center is}} {{studying}} hydrothermal growth process of ZnO nanorods {{for the last}} few years. A typical process was carried out in a sealed chemical bath containing an <b>equimolar</b> <b>solution</b> of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylene tetramine at a temperature of 95 °C for a period of up to 20 hours. The thickness and length of the nanowires can be controlled by using different concentrations of the starting reactants and growth durations. A 0.5 mM chemical bath yielded nanowires with an average diameter of around 50 nm while a 25 mM bath resulted in wires with a thickness of up to about 1μm. The length of the wires depends both on the concentration of the precursor solution as well as the growth duration, and in 20 hours, nanowires as long as 10 µm can be grown.|$|E

Thermo-gravimetry revealed moderate thermal stabilities for Poly NAM and Poly NAS and low thermal stability for Poly NAA which indicated 5. 9 %, 7. 1 % and 61. 2 % weight losses at 285 ˚C, 285 ˚C and 374 ˚C for the three products respectively. The wavelengths of maximum absorbance for the dye samples are 601. 5, 591 and 589 nm respectively with absorptivity coefficients () of 11640000, 11610000 and 11560000 respectively. 1 % 1 cma Melting points were determined with Gallenkamp melt...|$|R
