5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King Bolesław I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the sword by <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> against the Golden Gate, Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959. In the 20th century, an image of the sword was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E

The driver of another {{approaching}} vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> but not injuring anyone. Bryant then {{got back into the}} BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.|$|E
25|$|Shaping {{involves}} gradually {{modifying the}} existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages {{with a dog}} by <b>hitting</b> <b>it,</b> then {{he or she could}} have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.|$|E
50|$|Most players {{play with}} power, {{attempting}} to <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> {{as fast as}} possible so the opposing player doesn't have time to react. Others try to <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> in the side to try {{to get it out of}} reach of the player.|$|R

25|$|From a poor {{defensive}} {{position on}} the baseline, the lob {{can be used as}} either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an overhead smash, a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the visual interest of his show, Emerson would abuse his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, <b>hitting</b> <b>it,</b> beating {{it with a}} whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations {{before it was}} increasingly taken up by adults around {{the beginning of the}} 17th century.

25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} aircraft losing altitude, falling into a sideslip and descending into the ground, first <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> with the right wingtip. The cause of loss of altitude was unknown, but could either have been part of a sideways banking maneuver or uncontrolled. The varying weather with pockets of good and poor visibility led the commission to believe that the aircraft could have flown into an area with fog and lost sight of the horizon. It reported that the accident took place towards the end of a very long flight and that fatigue could have reduced the pilots' faculties. This could be a decisive pivoting factor in the narrow margins while maneuvering at such low altitudes. The commission found no signs of technical error on the aircraft. It also commented that flying at low altitudes over the sea was common because of the lower wind speeds.|$|E
25|$|At {{the debut}} {{pre-season}} game of Cowboys Stadium, a punt by Tennessee Titans kicker, A. J. Trapasso, hit the 2,100 in. screen above the field. The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. (Many believe Trapasso {{was trying to}} hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and {{the angle of the}} kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines — hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> with the hooked beak, {{aiming for the}} skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
25|$|Vari-Target: These targets reward a {{different}} {{number of points}} depending on how hard the target was <b>hit.</b> <b>It</b> is a metal arm that pivots under the playfield. When a ball <b>hits</b> <b>it,</b> it ratchets back sometimes, resetting immediately or resetting only after <b>it</b> is <b>hit</b> all the way back. A large sum of points is usually rewarded when the target is hit back all the way with one strike of the ball.|$|R

Richard Whitington wrote in the 1970s that McCabe's innings [...] "still warms {{the blood of the}} dwindling number of Australians who watched it". McCabe received a thunderous standing ovation from the 46,000 spectators. Immediately after the innings, McCabe told his teammates that he {{would never be able to}} replicate the feat because it was too difficult to hook the ball consistently without <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> up into the air and giving away catching opportunities.|$|E
500|$|Nutter {{predominantly}} {{played as}} a left-sided full-back, {{although he did}} play on the left wing {{in the early stages}} of his career. He was left-footed. Gillingham manager Mark Stimson [...] described him as [...] "an attacking full-back with plenty of technical ability", and stated that Nutter would [...] "offer plenty of width down the left hand side", in-turn being [...] "a constant attacking threat". He expressed a passion to pass the ball along the floor, and always prefers to pass the ball out as opposed to <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> long. Talking about his time at Stevenage, Nutter [...] stated he would like to be remembered as a player [...] "who tried to play football the right way, passing the ball, technically good to watch and an honest player".|$|E

500|$|In {{his attempt}} to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he {{analyzed}} the most popular games of those times (rugby, [...] lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and baseball); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball {{and concluded that the}} big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or <b>hitting</b> <b>it,</b> so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game duck on a rock. Naismith christened this new game [...] "Basket Ball" [...] and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.|$|E
500|$|Intended {{to resist}} {{the impact of a}} [...] armour-piercing bomb dropped from a height of , Vanguards deck {{protection}} was identical to that of the King George V class. It consisted of six-inch non-cemented armour over the magazines that reduced to [...] over the machinery spaces. The armour continued forward and aft of the citadel at the lower-deck level. Forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2.5inches near the bow. Aft, it protected the steering gear and propeller shafts with 4.5inches of armour before tapering to a thickness of 2.5inches near the stern. Unlike the Germans, French and Americans, the British no longer believed that heavy armour for the conning tower served any real purpose given that the chance of <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> was very small; Vanguards conning tower was therefore protected with [...] of armour on the face and 2.5inches on the sides and rear. The secondary conning tower aft had [...] of armour on its sides.|$|E
500|$|Needing to beat Inter Milan {{to win the}} Emirates Cup, Arsenal {{failed to}} take the {{initiative}} and went behind after 62 minutes. William Gallas' negligence to spot the incoming David Suazo meant the Inter striker was able to head the ball past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. Arsenal regrouped quickly and scored five minutes later; a well-worked move between Eboué and Bacary Sagna set Hleb up to shoot, but his effort was saved by Toldo. The ball rebounded to the Arsenal midfielder, whose second shot went into the far corner. Near the end of normal time Robin van Persie scored a [...] "wonder goal" [...] to secure the win. Collecting a long pass from Eboué, the striker weaved past his opponent and dragged the ball back, before <b>hitting</b> <b>it</b> high into the far corner.
