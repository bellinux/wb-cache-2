5|$|In {{addition}} to serving as social cues {{between members of}} the same species, Mups can act as kairomones—chemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two <b>homologous</b> <b>protein</b> signals were identified: Feld4 (Felis domesticus allergen 4), the product of the cat Mup gene, and Ratn1 (Rattus norvegicus allergen 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class.|$|E

2500|$|One of Dayhoff's most {{important}} contributions to bioinformatics was her Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, a book reporting all known protein sequences (totaling 65) that she published in 1965. It was subsequently republished in several editions. [...] This {{led to the}} Protein Information Resource database of protein sequences, the first online database system that could be accessed by telephone line and available for interrogation by remote computers. The book has since been cited nearly 4,500 times. It and the parallel effort by Walter Goad {{which led to the}} GenBank database of nucleic acid sequences are the twin origins of the modern databases of molecular sequences. [...] The Atlas was organized by gene families, and she is regarded as a pioneer in their recognition. Frederick Sanger's determination of the first complete amino acid sequence of a protein (insulin) in 1955, led a number of researchers to sequence various proteins from different species. In the early 1960s, a theory was developed that small differences between <b>homologous</b> <b>protein</b> sequences (sequences with a high likelihood of common ancestry) could indicate the process and rate of evolutionary change on the molecular level. The notion that such molecular analysis could help scientists decode evolutionary patterns in organisms was formalized in the published papers of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling in 1962 and 1965.|$|E

Deletion of the fructose-specific transport proteins resulted in no significant difference to the wild type concerning growth and storage behavior.

Besides the generation of deletion mutants and their phenotypical characterization, intensive studies on the putative operon ptsMHI are now necessary to characterize the respective genes in more detail and to resolve their roles in the metabolism of R. eutropha. Certainly, this study provides a further degree of regulation between the general PTS proteins and both, PHB and carbon metabolism in R. eutropha H 16.|$|R

Similarities in the hydropathy distributions are obvious for <b>homologous</b> <b>proteins</b> within a protein family.

Here we present a novel method that employs the hydropathy distribution in proteins for identification of (sub) families in a set of (<b>homologous)</b> <b>proteins.</b> We represent proteins as points in a generalized hydropathy space, represented by vectors of specifically defined features. The features are derived from hydropathy of the individual amino acids. Projection of this space onto principal axes reveals groups of proteins with related hydropathy distributions. The groups identified correspond well to families of structurally and functionally related proteins. We found that this method accurately identifies protein families in a set of proteins, or subfamilies in a set of <b>homologous</b> <b>proteins.</b> Our results show that protein families can be identified by the analysis of hydropathy distribution, without the need for sequence alignment.
