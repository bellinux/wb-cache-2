5|$|By 1949, Soviet-backed governments {{had already}} begun seizing control {{throughout}} Eastern Europe, forming such puppet states as the Hungarian People's Republic in Teller's homeland of Hungary, where much of his family still lived, on August 20, 1949. Following the Soviet Union's first test detonation of an atomic bomb on August 29, 1949, President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> announced a crash development program for a hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|During {{much of the}} {{presidency}} of <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman,</b> Blair House served as the temporary residence of President Truman while {{the interior of the}} White House was being renovated. On November 1, 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo attempted to assassinate President Truman in Blair House. The assassination was foiled, in part by White House policeman Leslie Coffelt, who killed Torresola but was mortally wounded by him.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{has been}} {{politically}} conservative {{for much of}} its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). During this time, it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman.</b> However, Oklahoma Democrats were {{generally considered to be}} more conservative than Democrats in other states.|$|E

Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E

The house is part of <b>Harry</b> S. <b>Truman</b> National Historic Site, and is a designated National Historic Landmark.|$|R
5|$|The British {{government}} had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British {{saw as a}} joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee went to Washington, D.C., to confer with President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The three leaders agreed {{that there would be}} full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that this was restricted to basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman,</b> which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|The post-war years {{also saw}} the News-Miner {{take a more active}} role in {{territorial}} politics. Prior to the 1948 election, Lathrop believed Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey would handily defeat Democratic incumbent <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman.</b> To take advantage of the anticipated governmental shift, Lathrop instructed the News-Miner to ramp up its pro-Republican editorials. In order to assist that process, he appointed William Strand, a war correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, as the News-Miner's new editor. Though Truman won the 1948 election, the News-Miner stayed politically active in endorsing Republican candidates and issues. This ended only with Lathrop's death on July 26, 1950.|$|E

5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
5|$|Bacher {{and fellow}} {{commissioner}} Sumner Pike {{began with an}} inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted an inventory of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with the reactors at Hanford. These problems {{were on their way}} to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission's representative. Bacher's original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, and this time the President was unable to dissuade him.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E

5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) warns the FBI and BATF that Ephesian and {{his wives}} will be {{released}} in a day unless they can track down Sidney and the Temple's reported weapons cache. The agents question Ephesian, who states {{that there is no}} member of the temple named Sidney. When they interview Melissa, she suddenly begins to talk like Sidney, claiming that <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> is president. Scully believes Melissa is exhibiting multiple personality disorder, but Mulder thinks she is recalling a past life. The agents take her back to the temple, where she takes on the personality of a woman from the Civil War period and says that the weapons were hidden in another secret bunker in the field. She also states that Mulder, in a past life, was a Confederate soldier in the field with her, her beloved, and she watched him die.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{administration}} of <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> had become convinced that the Guatemalan government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, {{at least until the}} end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by Árbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFORTUNE. The plan had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. Truman gave the CIA permission {{to go ahead with the}} plan, without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the right-wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan.|$|E

5|$|Born the illegitimate {{son of a}} planter, Castillo Armas {{was educated}} at Guatemala's {{military}} academy. A protégé of Colonel Francisco Javier Arana, he joined Arana's forces during the 1944 uprising against President Federico Ponce Vaides. This began the Guatemalan Revolution {{and the introduction of}} representative democracy to the country. After Vaides' fall, Castillo Armas was promoted to lieutenant colonel, joined the General Staff, and became director of the military academy. Arana and Castillo Armas opposed the newly elected government of Juan José Arévalo; after Arana's failed 1949 coup, Castillo Armas went into exile in Honduras. Seeking support for another revolt, he {{came to the attention of}} the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In 1950 he launched a failed assault on Guatemala City, before escaping back to Honduras. Influenced by Cold War fears of communism and the pressure from the United Fruit Company, in 1952 the US government of President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> authorised Operation PBFORTUNE, a plot to overthrow Arévalo's leftist successor, President Jacobo Árbenz. Castillo Armas was to lead the coup, but the plan was abandoned before being revived in a new form by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after World War II new coal companies, Peabody, Bluebird, and Sahara {{starting}} mining {{within the}} city. The war created a great demand for energy, which was satisfied by expanded strip mining operations throughout the Harrisburg Coal Fields. Shortly after World War II, {{it became clear}} that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas. In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour in September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic recovery for the region. Without hesitating, the long parade of police, buses, and accompanying cars sped through town. Poplar street, at that time the main drag through town, was crowded with multitudes of persons for its entire length. It was reported by the Daily Register Newspaper that cars were lined along Route 13 all the way from Marion and on to Eldorado on Route 45. In 1950 Assistant State Attorney General of Illinois, George N. Leighton, Represented parents in a proceeding which desegregated the public schools of Harrisburg. On December 1, 1953, WSIL-TV 3 was founded and based out of the city.

5|$|Operation PBFORTUNE, {{also known}} as Operation FORTUNE, {{was the name of}} a covert United States {{operation}} to overthrow the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in 1952. The operation was authorized by US President <b>Harry</b> <b>Truman</b> and planned by the Central Intelligence Agency. The United Fruit Company had lobbied intensively for the overthrow because landmark land reform enacted by Árbenz threatened its economic interests. The coup attempt was also motivated by US fears that the government of Árbenz was being influenced by communists. It involved providing weapons to the exiled Guatemalan military officer Carlos Castillo Armas, who was to lead an invasion from Nicaragua. The coup was planned with the knowledge and support of Anastasio Somoza García, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-backed right-wing dictators of Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Venezuela respectively, as well as the United Fruit Company. However, the US State Department discovered that details of the plan had become too widely known. US Secretary of State Dean Acheson was worried that the coup attempt would damage the image of the US, which had committed to a policy of non-intervention, and so terminated the operation. Operation PBFORTUNE was a precursor to Operation PBSUCCESS, the covert operation that toppled Árbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution in 1954.|$|E
