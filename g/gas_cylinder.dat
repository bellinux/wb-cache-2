5|$|A diving cylinder, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> used to store and {{transport}} the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, an {{even more}} compact {{personal}} defence weapon variant of the R5 was developed for armored vehicle crews, designated the R6, which has a further reduced barrel and a shortened <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> and piston assembly.|$|E

25|$|The Tantal is a {{selective}} fire, gas piston operated weapon that taps expanding exhaust gases off through a port in the barrel to a <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> above the barrel. The barrel is locked against its longitudinal axis by a right rotating bolt. A spring extractor is contained inside the bolt head, and a fixed ejector—inside the receiver housing.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder,</b> propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E

25|$|The {{gasoline}} is fed either from a pressurised tank (whose pressure can be hand-pumped or fed from a <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder).</b> OR from a non pressurised tank with the fuel being {{drawn into the}} torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a foot-operated air pump, and burning the fuel-air mixture in a specialized welding torch.|$|E
25|$|Filling air {{is usually}} {{supplied}} {{from the surface}} from a low pressure compressor, but for small lifts the diver may carry a cylinder of air for the purpose. It is considered bad practice in some jurisdictions to fill a lift bag from the diver's breathing <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder,</b> particularly if the diver has decompression obligations or only one cylinder as the risk of using up too much air and leaving the diver without sufficient air for a safe ascent is considered unacceceptable.|$|E
25|$|The chamber is hand cut using chamber reamers {{specially}} {{designed for the}} M118LR round. Smith Enterprise Inc. is the only civilian rifle builder who uses these reamers. The gas system is unitized and hardened via Melonite. The gas piston is hard chromed to tolerances to ensure a precision fit within the hardened <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Unlike traditional M14 rifles, the front sight is mounted on the gas lock {{as opposed to the}} muzzle to allow use of a direct-connect sound suppressor that mounts to the Vortex Flash Hider.|$|E

25|$|After Pellicci was hospitalised in May 1978 due {{to severe}} burns from an {{exploding}} <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder,</b> Geoff Cox (ex-Brian Cadd, Bootleg Family Band, Avalanche) substituted on drums, {{rather than the}} group cancelling shows for their next US tour. On that tour they supported Boz Scaggs, Jimmy Buffett and the Eagles. Cox remained with the group through mid-1978 and played alongside Pellicci after the latter returned, until he was healed enough to continue on his own. Mal Logan (ex-the Dingoes, Renée Geyer Band) joined on keyboards for another US tour which began in late December 1978.|$|E
25|$|Compressed air foam system (CAFS): The CAFS {{extinguisher}} (example: TRI-MAX Mini-CAF) {{differs from}} a standard stored-pressure premix foam extinguisher {{in that it}} operates at a higher pressure of 140 psi, aerates the foam with an attached compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> instead of an air-aspirating nozzle, and uses a drier foam solution with a higher concentrate to water ratio. Generally used to extend a water supply in wildland operations. Used on class A fires and with very dry foam on class B for vapor suppression. These are very expensive, special purpose extinguishers typically used by fire departments or other safety professionals.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, after various {{changes of}} ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group. In 1998, SodaStream {{was bought by}} Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier. In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> refilling and refurbishment department to Germany. Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries. In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability. Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.|$|E

500|$|Bi-fuel {{vehicles}}. The term flexible-fuel vehicles {{is sometimes}} used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG; also known as autogas), or hydrogen. However, all these vehicles actually are bi-fuel and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. Bi-fuel vehicles {{have the capability to}} switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. The most common available fuel in the market for bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG), and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), Argentina (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million). [...] Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as taxicabs in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours {{she sat in the}} Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E
