25|$|Predecessors of {{the modern}} Akita were used for hunting bear, wild boar and deer in Japan as late as 1957. They {{would be used to}} flush out the bear and keep it at bay until the hunter could come and kill it. Today, the breed is used {{primarily}} as a companion dog. However, the breed is currently also known to be used as therapy dogs, and compete in all dog competitions including: conformation showing, obedience trials, canine <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> program, tracking trials and agility competition, as well as weight pulling, hunting and schutzhund (i.e., personal protection dogs).|$|E
25|$|The Pillar of Fire Church {{strongly}} {{argued against}} {{social and political}} equality for Blacks and advocated for racial segration and repeal of the fifteenth amendment. The Pillar allowed the Klan to hold meetings or cross burnings on at least several of the church's numerous properties including numerous documented Klan gatherings in Zarephath, New Jersey; Brooklyn, New York; Bound Brook, New Jersey; Longmont, Colorado; and Westminster, Colorado. White participated directly {{in many of these}} meetings. During this time, the Pillar of Fire Church published The <b>Good</b> <b>Citizen,</b> a monthly 16 page political magazine and three books, The Ku Klux Klan In Prophecy, , and Heroes of the Fiery Cross, all of which heavily promoted the Klan and its agenda from 1921 until 1933. Ideologically, in these publications, the Pillar of Fire Church promoted anti-Catholicism, antisemitism, nativism, and white supremacy, all primarily under the guise of patriotism.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man can be a <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> {{who is not a}} good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

2500|$|In {{conformation}} shows, where dogs' conformation to a {{breed standard}} is evaluated, mixed-breed dogs normally cannot compete. For purebred dogs, their physical characteristics are judged against a single breed standard. Mixed-breed dogs, however, {{are difficult to}} classify except according to height; there is tremendous variation in physical traits such as coat, skeletal structure, gait, ear set, eye shape and color, and so on. When conformation standards are applied to mixed-breed dogs, such as in events run by the MBDCA, the standards are usually general traits of health, soundness, symmetry, and personality. The Kennel Club (UK) operates a show called Scruffts (a name derived from its prestigious Crufts show) open only to mixed-breeds in which dogs are judged on character, health, and temperament. Some kennel clubs, whose purpose is to promote purebred dogs, still exclude mixed-breeds from their performance events. The AKC and the FCI are two such prominent organizations. While the AKC does allow mixed-breed dogs to earn their Canine <b>Good</b> <b>Citizen</b> award, mixed-breed dogs {{are not permitted to}} enter AKC [...] "all breed" [...] events, though through their [...] "Canine Partners" [...] program, mixed breed dogs can be registered to compete in AKC Agility, Obedience, and Rally events.|$|E

[...] The party also issued a statement signed by the party's chairman Mohamed Morsi that stated Shenouda's life was [...] "a long journey of big contribution in various fields domestically and abroad." [...] Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri's statement read: [...] "I give my sincere condolences to the Coptic brothers home and abroad.

[...] Former Prime Minister Essam Sharaf called Shenouda a [...] "devout clergyman, a <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> and a valuable leader. ... His vision was always that Egypt is not the country that we live in; but the country that lives in us." [...] Upcoming presidential candidates also issued statements.
