40|$|The {{water flow}} and {{movement}} of silt in a prototype double suction centrifugal pump was simulated using an Eulerâ€“ Lagrange multiphase flow model. Back-blade and J-groove configurations were adopted {{to protect the}} <b>impeller</b> <b>ring</b> from silt abrasion. Four back-blades and four J-grooves were considered. The {{results show that the}} relative velocity of water around the <b>impeller</b> <b>ring</b> is too low to move silt out of the spacing between the impeller and the casing, which results in a high silt concentration around the <b>impeller</b> <b>ring.</b> The high silt concentration around the <b>impeller</b> <b>ring</b> is the major contributor to silt abrasion of the ring. Back-blade and J-groove configurations are effective in reducing the silt concen-tration around the ring but extra friction loss is also introduced and the pump efficiency is decreased. Optimization of the length, position and number of back-blades, and the shape and number of J-grooves, decreases losses in pump efficiency and effectively protects the <b>impeller</b> <b>ring.</b> Case 4 for the back-blade and Case 8 for the J-groove were the most effective configurations in this study...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 61 - 68 Vibration {{field data}} was {{measured}} on several large motor-driven vertical cooling water pumps which experienced excessive wear of the <b>impellers,</b> wear <b>rings</b> and seals {{after a short}} period of operation. The data indicated that the problem was due to the operating speed being near the pump-motor system mechanical natural frequency, which resulted in excessive vibration levels on the motors and pump impellers. The mechanical natural frequency was very sensitive to the effective stiffness of the connections between the concrete, baseplates, pump base and motor flange. Tests were conducted to evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} lowering the natural frequency below the running speed and raising the natural frequency above the running speed. The results of these tests are presented with conclusions and recommendations...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was successful in}} obtaining two improved designs for the <b>impeller</b> wear <b>ring</b> seal of the liquid hydrogen turbopump of interest. A finite difference computer code was extensively used in a parametric computational study in determining a cavity configuration with high flow resistance due to turbulence dissipation. These two designs, along with that currently used, were fabricated and tested. The improved designs were denoted Type O and Type S. The measurements showed that Type O and Type S given 67 and 30 percent reduction in leakage over the current design, respectively. It {{was found that the}} number of cavities, the step height and the presence of a small stator groove are quite important design features. Also, the tooth thickness is of some significance. Finally, the tooth height and an additional large cavity cut out from the stator (upstream of the step) are of negligible importance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a combined analytical and experimental investigation of low specific speed pumps for potential use as components of propellant feed systems for low thrust rocket engines. Shrouded impellers and open face impellers were tested in volute type and vaned diffuser type pumps. Full- and partial-emission diffusers and full- and partial-admission impellers were tested. Axial and radial loads, head and efficiency versus flow, and cavitation tests were conducted. Predicted performance of two pumps are compared when pumping water and liquid hydrogen. Detailed pressure loss and parasitic power values are presented for two pump configurations. Partial-emission diffusers were found to permit use of larger impeller and diffuser passages with a minimal performance penalty. Normal manufacturing tolerances were found to result in substantial power requirement variation with only a small pressure rise change. <b>Impeller</b> wear <b>ring</b> leakage was found to reduce pump pressure rise to an increasing degree as the pump flowrate was decreased...|$|R
40|$|Multistage {{horizontal}} {{boiler feed}} pumps are {{designed and built}} in two different configurations: with equidirectional or with opposite impellers. Advantages and disadvantages of the two design criteria are hereto analysed and described. The study is carried out from hydraulic and structural point of view. A particular attention is addressed to the axial load balance and to the lateral dynamic analysis, with new and worn clearance conditions. A complete calculation of rotor dynamic behaviour in both configurations has been performed using the finite element method. The model of the shaft has been meshed using beam elements, while linearised coefficients have been evaluated in order to simulate stiffness and damping of sleeve bearings, <b>impeller</b> wear <b>rings,</b> balancing drums and interstage seals. Undamped critical speed map, damped mode shapes and Campbell diagrams are presented and discussed. Calculation results are confirmed by experimental measurements carried out on an opposite impeller multistage pump, where non contacting probes have been installed nearby sleeve bearings locations, and order tracking method has been applied during start-up and coast-down transients...|$|R
40|$|LectureAnnular {{clearance}} spaces, such as <b>impeller</b> wearing <b>rings,</b> inter 0 stage {{bushes and}} balance drums in centrifugal pumps, or the fluid-filled clearance around the armature of the submerged motor, at a first glance present {{the appearance of}} very weak journal bearings. The fluid has very low viscosity compared with lubricating oils, and clearances are much larger than in proper journal bearings. Two factors invalidate this deceptive view. Firstly, the Reynold numbers of flows in these spaces are very high, rendering flows turbulent. This greatly increases effective viscosities. Secondly, fluid inertia effects not normally encountered in journal bearings and become basic determining factors of the bearing forces raised by internal clearances of the type indicated. In clearance spaces of centrifugal pumps, the high pressure differences across the clearance spaces bring about a sudden pressure drop owing to acceleration into the space. This converts the clearance space into a powerful hydrostatic bearing. As the journal rotates and vibrates, damping and crossing coupling forces are developed as well as radial stiffness. Here, fluid inertia is significant only in the entry loss effect which controls hydrostatic stiffness. In the submerged motor, where the fine clearance surrounds a large length of shaft, fluid inertia effects in the clearance space itself become dominant. Both types of clearance space alter the synchronous response and stability limits of the rotor (beyond recognition), {{as compared with the}} performance in air. In centrifugal pumps, generally, the internal clearances both raise and damp critical speeds and improve stability margins. There are, however, special circumstances where these clearances become destabilizing elements. In submerged motors, critical speeds are substantially reduced and damped, and the type of destabilization normally associated with circular journal bearings may be encountered. The paper explains these phenomena and illustrates them with simple calculations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimum {{operational}} conditions {{of a novel}} rotated bed electrocoagulation (EC) reactor {{for the treatment of}} textile wastewater. The effect of various operational parameters such as rotational speed, current density (CD), operational time (RT), pH, temperature, and inter-electrode distance (IED) on the pollutant removal efficiency were examined. In addition, the consumption of aluminum (Al) and electrical energy, as well as operating costs at optimum conditions were also calculated. The results indicated that the optimum conditions for the treatment of textile wastewater were achieved at CD = 4 mA/cm 2, RT = 10 min, rotational speed = 150 rpm, pH = 4. 57, temperature = 25 0 C, and IED = 1 cm. The electrode consumption, energy consumption, and operating costs were 0. 038 kg/m 3, 4. 66 kWh/m 3 and 0. 44 US/m 3, respectively. The removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solid (TSS), turbidity and color were 97. 10, 95. 55, 98, 96 and 98. 50, respectively, at the first 10 min of reaction time, while the phenol compound of the wastewater was almost entirely removed (99. 99). The experimental results confirm that the new reactor design with rotated anode <b>impellers</b> and cathode <b>rings</b> provided high treatment efficiency at a reduced reaction time and with lower energy consumption. 9 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} two-stage unshrouded impeller turbopump to replace the current three-stage reusable launch vehicle engine shrouded impeller hydrogen pump has been evaluated {{from the standpoint of}} turbopump weight reduction and overall payload improvement. These advantages are a by-product of the higher tip speeds that an unshrouded impeller can sustain. The issues associated with the effect of unshrouded impeller tip clearance on pump efficiency and head have been evaluated with one-dimensional tools and full three-dimensional rotordynamic fluid reaction forces and coefficients have been established through time dependent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the whole 360 degree impeller with different rotor eccentricities and whirling ratios. Unlike the shrouded impeller, the unshrouded impeller forces are evaluated as the sum of the pressure forces on the blade and the pressure forces on the hub using the CFD results. The turbopump axial thrust control has been optimized by adjusting the first stage <b>impeller</b> backend wear <b>ring</b> seal diameter and diverting the second stage backend balance piston flow to the proper location. The structural integrity associated with the high tip speed has been checked by analyzing a 3 D-Finite Element Model at maximum design conditions (6 % higher than the design speed). This impeller was fabricated and tested in the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center water-test rig. The experimental data will be compared with the analytical predictions and presented in another paper. The experimental data provides validation data for the numerical design and analysis methodology. The validated numerical methodology can be used to help design different unshrouded impeller configurations...|$|R
40|$|Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes, {{prevalent}} in the rocket engine turbomachinery industry, necessitates data of sufficient quality and quantity to benchmark computational codes. Existing data bases for typical rocket engine configurations, in particular impellers, are limited. In addition, traditional data acquisition methods have several limitations: typically transducer uncertainties are 0. 5 % of transducer full scale and traditional pressure probes are unable to provide flow characteristics in the circumferential (blade-to-blade) direction. Laser velocimetry circumvents these limitations by providing + 0. 5 % uncertainty in flow velocity and + 0. 5 % uncertainty in flow angle. The percent of uncertainty in flow velocity {{is based on the}} measured value, not full range capability. The laser electronics multiple partitioning capability allows data acquired between blades as the impeller rotates, to be analyzed separately, thus providing blade-to-blade flow characterization. Unlike some probes, the non-intrusive measurements made with the laser velocimeter does not disturb the flow. To this end,, and under Contract (NAS 8 - 38864) to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), an extensive test program was undertaken at Rocketdyne. Impellers from two different generic rocket engine pump configurations were examined. The impellers represent different spectrums of pump design: the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) impeller was designed in the 1 1970 's the Consortium for CFD application in Propulsion Technology Pump Stage Technology Team (Pump Consortium) optimized impeller was designed with the aid of modern computing techniques. The tester configuration for each of the impellers consisted of an axial inlet, an inducer, a diffuser, and a crossover discharge. While the tested configurations were carefully chosen to be representative of generic rocket engine pumps, several features of both testers were intentionally atypical. A crossover discharge, downstream of the impeller, rather than a volute discharge was used to minimize asymmetric flow conditions that might be reflected in the impeller discharge flow data. <b>Impeller</b> shroud wear <b>ring</b> radial clearances were purposely close to minimize leakage flow, thus increasing confidence in using the inlet data as an input to CFD programs. The empirical study extensively examined the flow fields of the two impellers via performance of laser two-focus velocimeter surveys in an axial plane upstream of the impellers and in multiple radial planes downstream of the impellers. Both studies were performed at the impeller design flow coefficients. Inlet laser surveys that provide CFD code inlet boundary conditions were performed in one axial plane, with ten radial locations surveyed. Three wall static pressures, positioned circumferentially around the impeller inlet, were used to identify asymmetrical pressure distributions in the inlet survey plane. The impeller discharge flow characterization consisted of three radial planes for the SSME HPFTP impeller and two radial planes for the Pump Consortium optimized impeller. Housing wall static pressures were placed to correspond to the radial locations surveyed with the laser velocimeter. Between five and thirteen axial stations across the discharge channel width were examined in each radial plane during the extensive flow mapping. The largely successful empirical flow characterization of two different impellers resulted in a substantial contribution to the limited existing data base, and yielded accurate data for CFD code benchmarking...|$|R
