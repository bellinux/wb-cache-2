40|$|Decision {{support systems}} have been {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} extending the information processing capabilities of less experienced operators by reducing the amount of information to be processed at a given point in time. Conducted in a firefighting context, the current study examined whether the decision-making performance of inexperienced <b>Incident</b> <b>Commanders</b> could be improved with the use of three decision support systems that differed in their demands for information processing. Although the results revealed that the implementation of a reduced processing strategy was associated with a reduction in decision time, the decision accuracy of the inexperienced <b>Incident</b> <b>Commanders</b> did not approach the decision accuracy of the experienced <b>Incident</b> <b>Commanders.</b> The evidence suggests that experienced <b>Incident</b> <b>Commanders</b> were acquiring features that were more relevant to the decision-task. These results highlight some of the limitations to the implementation of decision support systems. Mechanisms may be needed to ensure that less experienced operators are processing relevant information when using reduced processing interfaces. ...|$|R

During {{his time in}} Northern Ireland he was the <b>Incident</b> <b>Commander</b> at the Droppin Well bombing in Ballykelly which killed seventeen people.

500|$|He went on {{to serve}} in Northern Ireland as {{adjutant}} to 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), and {{was present at the}} events of Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972, when 13protesters were shot dead by soldiers from 1 PARA in Derry. He was in the tactical headquarters of the Army's operation to contain the protests immediately before the shooting began and he accompanied the battalion commander, Derek Wilford, when Wilford decided to join the soldiers on the ground. The shooting was over by the time Jackson reached the soldiers' position, but he recalls seeing several bodies in the back of an Army vehicle. In 1976, he was promoted to major and attended the Staff College, Camberley, before being posted to Germany as chief of staff to the Berlin Infantry Brigade. After Berlin, Jackson served his second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time as a company commander. While there, he witnessed the aftermath of the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush, the British Army's single largest loss of life during The Troubles. He acted as the <b>incident</b> <b>commander,</b> arriving on the scene shortly after the second explosion, and had to identify Major Peter Fursman, a close friend, from the remains of Fursman's face, which had been blown clear of his skull. He later spoke of the effect the incident had on him, saying, [...] "It greatly disturbed me. Still does". He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1979 Queen's Birthday Honours and was mentioned in despatches in 1981, in recognition of his service in Northern Ireland.|$|E

500|$|On September 8, {{the first}} of a series of new {{high-resolution}} imagery from DigitalGlobe was made available via the Amazon Mechanical Turk beta website so that users could flag potential areas of interest for searching, in what is known as crowdsourcing. By September 11, up to 50,000 people had joined the effort, scrutinizing more than 300,000 278-square-foot squares of the imagery. Peter Cohen of Amazon believed that by September 11, the entire search area had been covered at least once. Amazon's search effort was shut down the week of October 29, without any measurable success. Major Cynthia Ryan later said it had been more of a hindrance than a help. She said that persons purporting to have seen the aircraft on the Mechanical Turk or have special knowledge clogged her email during critical days of the search, and for even months afterward. Many of the ostensible sightings proved to be images of CAP aircraft flying search grids, or simply mistaken artifacts of old images. Psychics flooded the search base in Minden with predictions of where the aviator could be found. Ryan got the majority of these calls personally, often at her home, in the middle of the night. One man from Canada was particularly persistent with daily calls to Ryan, interfering with her press briefings. Ryan asked her <b>Incident</b> <b>Commander</b> to issue a cease and desist order, backed up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) if necessary. Ryan noted that every message, letter, or phone call was taken seriously, which swamped the USAF specialists assigned the task of reviewing every one of them without regard to apparent plausibility. In retrospect, the crowdsource effort was [...] "not ready for prime time", according to Ryan.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{leading cause}} of death during {{firefighting}} is structural collapse of a burning building (e.g. a wall, floor, ceiling, roof, or truss system). [...] Structural collapse, which often occurs without warning, may crush or trap firefighters inside the structure.
