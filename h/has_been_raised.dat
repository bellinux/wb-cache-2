5|$|In England and Wales, {{this age}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{numerous}} times since {{the introduction of}} compulsory education in 1870. On 1 September 1972, the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began eight years earlier in 1964. This left a gap year of school leavers who, by law, had to complete an additional year of education from 1973 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters.

5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{criticism}} against several fundamental {{shortcomings in}} the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E
5|$|Australia Acts commencement, 3 March – The {{anniversary of}} the Australia Acts coming into force <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> as an option, having been {{referred}} to as Australian Independence Day. These Acts removed the United Kingdom's ability to legislate for the Australian States, the Queen's ability to disallow or suspend State legislation, as well as severing the remaining appeal channels from the State Supreme Courts and the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II signed a proclamation at Government House in Canberra on 2 March 1986 for the Acts to take effect 5.00am Greenwich Mean Time the next day.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; {{this suggests that the}} Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about North American species.|$|E

5|$|Works by {{winners and}} nominees of the Campbell Award were {{collected}} in the New Voices series of anthologies, edited by George R. R. Martin, which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984. Campbell nominees and winners, such as Michael A. Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility with established authors and publishers. Criticism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about the Campbell that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E

5|$|Much of this {{acceptance}} {{has been}} based on the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged; grooved canines in Euchambersia would parallel the fangs of various venomous snakes as well as the venom-delivering incisors of the living solenodons. This interpretation, which has consistently appeared in literature published after 1986, was determined by Julien Benoit {{to be the result of}} the propagation of Broom's overly reconstructed diagram of the skull, without the context of the actual specimens. This line of evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> to support the necessity of a re-evaluation the hypothesis of a venomous bite in Euchambersia. Additionally, Benoit argued that grooved and ridged canines are not necessarily associated with venomous animals either, as shown by their presence in hippopotami, muntjacs, and baboons, in which they play a role in grooming or sharpening the teeth; in the latter two, ridged canines are also accompanied by a distinct fossa in front of the eye, which is entirely unconnected with venom. Furthermore, grooved and ridged teeth in non-venomous snakes are used to reduce suctional drag when capturing slippery prey like fish or invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{recovered}} materials, {{a fraction}} {{has been given}} to the New Mexico Museum of Space History for display, and another 100 to the documentary producers Lightbox and Fuel Entertainment. Galea believes the remaining cartridges can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future. The City of Alamogordo approved the auction of the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> through the sales of about 880 unearthed cartridges, with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 cartridges remain to be sold at a later date given the historical value of the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|Over 300,000 {{people took}} part and raised $3.5 {{million in the}} first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982.

The runs, which raised over $20 million in its first six years, grew into an international event as over one million people in 60 countries took part in 1999, raising $15 million that year alone. By the Terry Fox Run's 25th anniversary, more than three million people were taking part annually. Grants from the Terry Fox Foundation, which organizes the runs, have helped Canadian scientists make numerous advances in cancer research. The Terry Fox Run is the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and over $600 million <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> in his name.
