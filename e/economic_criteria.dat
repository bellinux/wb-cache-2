5|$|Childe {{has been}} {{considered}} the principal contributor to archaeological methodology {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and functionalism. Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology which was dominant during the 19thcentury. He believed that those archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts themselves rather than their makers. He recognised flaws in the technological-based three-age system first developed by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, rejecting its evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age by noting that many of the world's societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist model. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used <b>economic</b> <b>criteria</b> for sub-dividing the Stone Age into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} {{that opened the}} film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that {{they knew how to}} adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and <b>economic</b> <b>criteria.</b> The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E

500|$|To combat falling {{revenue from}} oil sales, in 1982 Saudi Arabia pressed OPEC for audited {{national}} production quotas {{in an attempt}} to limit output and boost prices. When other OPEC nations failed to comply, Saudi Arabia first slashed its own production from 10million barrels daily in 1979–1981 to just one-third of that level in 1985. When even this proved ineffective, Saudi Arabia reversed course and flooded the market with cheap oil, causing prices to fall below US$10/bbl and higher-cost producers to become unprofitable. Faced with increasing economic hardship (which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989), the [...] "free-riding" [...] oil exporters that had previously failed to comply with OPEC agreements finally began to limit production to shore up prices, based on painstakingly negotiated national quotas that sought to balance oil-related and <b>economic</b> <b>criteria</b> since 1986. (Within their sovereign-controlled territories, the national governments of OPEC members are able to impose production limits on both government-owned and private oil companies.) Generally when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{incorporation}} of safety concepts {{in the design of}} chemical plants, together the <b>economic</b> <b>criterion,</b> is a priority within the area of process systems engineering. An inherently safer chemical process avoids or reduces the hazards, rather than managing by adding layers of protection with safety devices. In this work, a systematic methodology is proposed for obtaining the optimal operation conditions that simultaneously seek for the minimization of the inherently safer index and the total annualized cost. This approach is applied to the case study of a styrene monomer production plant. The performance of some units of this plant have been rigorously analyzed using process simulators to obtain simplified models suitable for gradient-based optimization. These surrogated models together short-cut models for the remaining units define a nonlinear programing (NLP) model, which has been solved using the state-of-the-art NLP solvers. The results provide the optimal design and its operation conditions which minimize the risks and hazards of a chemical accident, and besides, takes into account the <b>economic</b> <b>criterion...</b>|$|R

One such criterion is income per capita; countries with high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries.

More recently another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating.|$|E

Against the intellectualist tradition, Bourdieu stressed that mechanisms of social domination and reproduction were primarily focused on bodily know-how and competent practices in the social world. Bourdieu fiercely opposed Rational Choice Theory as grounded in a misunderstanding of how social agents operate. Social agents do not, according to Bourdieu, continuously calculate according to explicit rational and <b>economic</b> <b>criteria.</b> Rather, social agents operate according to an implicit practical logic—a practical sense—and bodily dispositions.

40|$|Background: Today it is {{virtually}} impossible to operate alone on the international level in the logistics business. This promotes the establishment and development of new integrated business entities - logistic operators. However, such cooperation within a supply chain creates also many problems related to the supply chain reliability as well as the optimization of the supplies planning. 	The aim of this paper was to develop and formulate the mathematical model and algorithms to find the optimum plan of supplies by using <b>economic</b> <b>criterion</b> and the model for the probability evaluating of non-failure operation of supply chain. 	Methods: The mathematical model and algorithms to find the optimum plan of supplies were developed and formulated by using <b>economic</b> <b>criterion</b> and the model for the probability evaluating of non-failure operation of supply chain. 	Results and conclusions: The problem of ensuring failure-free performance of goods supply channel analyzed in the paper is characteristic of distributed network systems that make active use of business process outsourcing technologies. The complex planning problem occurring in such systems that requires taking into account the consumer&# 39;s requirements for failure-free performance in terms of supply volumes and correctness can be reduced to a relatively simple linear programming problem through logical analysis of the structures. The sequence of the operations, which should be taken into account during the process of the supply planning with the supplier&# 39;s functional reliability, was presented...|$|R
