5|$|Although {{distinctly}} {{different from each}} other, DNA damage and mutation are related because DNA damage often causes errors of <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesis</b> during replication or repair; these errors are {{a major source of}} mutation.|$|E
5|$|Replication {{of virus}} {{particles}} is {{the stage where}} a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesis</b> abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{throughout}} the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was to guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, {{all of whom were}} created {{as a result of a}} sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesis</b> and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that humans were largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.|$|E
40|$|Synchronous {{culture of}} Anacystis nidulans has been {{induced by the}} light-dark-light regimen. At various time {{intervals}} during synchronous growth, samples were pulsed with radioactive labels to determine phospholipid, protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and deoxyribonucleic acid (<b>DNA)</b> <b>syntheses</b> within the cell division cycle. A temporal order of protein, RNA, and <b>DNA</b> <b>syntheses</b> occurred within the cell division cycle, whereas phospholipid was characteristically synthesized during midcycle (during cell enlargement) and {{during the time of}} cell division.

A dose response curve was established for each individual and maximum <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis</b> {{was used as a}} measure of the capacity for DNA repair. The {{patients with the}} nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome had about 25 % lower level of maximum <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis</b> as compared to the patients with basal cell carcinomas and control individuals.

40|$|Cephaloridine and {{cephalexin}} had {{no effect}} on ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (<b>DNA),</b> or protein <b>synthesis</b> in Escherichia coli. However, cephalosporin 7 / 30 [7 -(S-benzylthioacetamido) -cephem- 3 -ylmethyl-N -dimethyldithiocarbamate- 4 -carboxylic acid] and dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDT), which occupies the side chain at position 3 in the 7 / 30 molecule, inhibited protein synthesis (and, to a lesser extent, RNA and <b>DNA</b> <b>syntheses)</b> in E. coli and had an inhibitory effect on the growth of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis. A bioautograph technique showed that two inhibitory spots were obtained with 7 / 30 but only one such spot with cephaloridine.

40|$|Histone and <b>DNA</b> <b>syntheses</b> {{have been}} studied in {{synchronously}} dividing Tetrahymena pyriformis GL. During the heat treatment necessary to synchronize cultures of this amicronucleate protozoan, the DNA content of the already polyploid macronucleus increases. When the cells begin synchronous division, their DNA content is reduced in a stepwise process which is closely paralleled by reduction of macronuclear histone content. During cell division, the contents of DNA and histone decrease by slightly more than twofold, and in the subsequent S phase, DNA and histone increase simultaneously to 85 % of the values expected if all chromosomes were to double. The {{first step in the}} process of reduction of DNA and histone contents is their decrease in excess of twofold, and this is accomplished by removal of extrusion bodies from the nuclei of dividing cells. The second step is a mechanism which allows, in effect, only 70 % of the chromatin in the average nucleus to duplicate. Such partial duplication suggests that both histone and <b>DNA</b> <b>syntheses</b> in synchronous Tetrahymena depend upon a regulatory mechanism, the mediating elements of which are localized in only certain chromosomes...|$|R

25|$|Anti-metabolites are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many {{of them have a}} similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are nucleotides; a molecule comprising a nucleobase, a sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleobases are divided into purines (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine and uracil). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered chemical groups. These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesis</b> or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesis,</b> they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, DNA damage can occur and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case S-phase (the <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesis</b> phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines.|$|E
40|$|The role of DNA {{polymerase}} alpha-DNA primase {{complex and}} DNA polymerase beta in DNA replication and ultraviolet-induced <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis</b> has been analyzed in mouse spermatogenesis. Autoradiographic experiments with germ cells in culture, indicating an involvement of DNA polymerase alpha and/or delta in DNA replication, and of DNA polymerase beta in <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis,</b> {{have been confirmed}} by studying partially purified enzymes.

Cell extracts of xeroderma pigmentosum origin (complementation groups A, C, D, and G) are deficient in <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis.</b> When damaged plasmid DNA was pretreated with purified Escherichia coli UvrABC proteins, xeroderma pigmentosum cell extracts were {{able to carry out}} <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis.</b> The ability of E. coli UvrABC proteins to complement xeroderma pigmentosum cell extracts indicates that the extracts are deficient in incision, but can carry out later steps of repair.

40|$|Base {{excision}} repair {{is an important}} mechanism for correcting DNA damage produced by many physical and chemical agents.

Deletional inactivation of REV 3 did not affect repair synthesis in the base {{excision repair}} pathway. Repair synthesis in nuclear extracts of pol 1, pol 2, and pol 3 temperature-sensitive mutants was normal at permissive temperatures. However, repair synthesis in pol 2 nuclear extracts was defective at the restrictive temperature of 37 degrees C and could be complemented by the addition of purified yeast DNA polymerase epsilon. Repair synthesis in pol 1 nuclear extracts was proficient at the restrictive temperature unless DNA polymerase alpha was inactivated prior to the initiation of DNA repair. Thermal inactivation of DNA polymerase delta in pol 3 nuclear extracts enhanced <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis</b> approximately 2 -fold, an effect which could be specifically reversed by the addition of purified yeast DNA polymerase delta to the extract. These results demonstrate that <b>DNA</b> repair <b>synthesis</b> in the yeast base excision repair pathway is catalyzed by DNA polymerase epsilon but is apparently modulated by the presence of DNA polymerases alpha and delta...|$|R
