Preface In practical production process, machining of <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for <b>internal</b> <b>thread,</b> but this method is difficult to machine <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> of parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole of the thread after machining process, and then using tapper to obtain the <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> manually or with machine. By this traditional method for <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> processing, the processes are distracted that increases time for handling, loading and unloading. It also lead to low efficiency, low accuracy of the perpendicularity error of thread. What’s more, tapper are always likely to break during tapping process, especially for parts with small diameter, and the depth of the thread is hard to control. To solve the problems mentioned above, a new type of tapping tool for machine use is developed. The tool bar could be inserted into the tapper hole on the lathe tailstock or installed o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMetallic {{lightweight}} materials {{are used for}} enhancing dynamic range, resource optimization and emission reduction in many fields of traffic engineering, whereby aluminium and magnesium components are manufactured by means of welded, adhesive and screw joints. Friction drilling, as forming process with subsequent manufacturing of threads, offers the opportunity to produce an <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> in lightweight profiles with a usable thread depth larger than the profile thickness, making use of local material expansion. Moreover, the direct manufacturing offers a huge potential for time and cost saving in comparison to conventional thread machining. Microscopic-based characterization of mechanical properties of aluminium AlSi 10 Mg and magnesium AZ 31 <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> in thin-walled profile specimens was carried out using tensile tests and fatigue tests in tensile loading range. The <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> were chipless manufactured by means of thread forming. Variations in the geometric process parameter wall thickness were compared. Differences between the AlSi 10 Mg chill casting alloy and the AZ 31 continuous casting alloy in maximum tolerable loads and fatigue limits were correlated with the production-related profile qualities of the profile specimens. The maximum tolerable loads increase linearly with increasing wall thickness of the specimens, whereby AlSi 10 Mg specimens were about 20 - 24 % lower in the quasi-static range and about 37 - 47 % lower in the cyclic range in comparison to AZ 31 specimens due to oval forms of the core holes caused by the friction drilling process. Plastic strain behavior and deformation-induced changes in temperature in load increase tests were evaluated to reliably estimate the fatigue limit of magnesium AZ 31 <b>internal</b> <b>threads...</b>|$|R
