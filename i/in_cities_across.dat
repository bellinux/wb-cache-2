The East German leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E

5|$|Despite wide popular interest, Escher was {{for long}} {{somewhat}} neglected {{in the art}} world; even in his native Netherlands, he was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the twenty-first century, major exhibitions have been held <b>in</b> <b>cities</b> <b>across</b> the world. An exhibition of his work in Rio de Janeiro however attracted more than 573,000 visitors in 2011; its daily visitor count of 9,677 made it the most visited museum exhibition of the year, anywhere in the world. No major exhibition of Escher's work was held in Britain until 2015, when the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art ran one in Edinburgh from June to September 2015, moving in October 2015 to the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. The exhibition moved to Italy in 2015–2016, attracting over 500,000 visitors in Rome and Bologna, and then Milan.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{challenge to the}} department and its detectives during Seedman's tenure as chief was the Black Liberation Army (BLA). An offshoot of the Black Panthers who espoused a more militant and radical philosophy, they staged deadly ambushes on police officers <b>in</b> <b>cities</b> <b>across</b> the country. In New York their three attacks left four officers dead and two seriously wounded; in one, no suspects have ever been identified. After one of the attacks the BLA claimed responsibility, saying it was avenging the deaths of 19 prisoners in the Attica prison riots the previous year. It was {{in this context that}} the incident that ended Seedman's police career occurred.|$|E
25|$|In July 1919, whites, {{including}} uniformed {{sailors and}} soldiers, attacked blacks in Washington during Red Summer, when violence broke out <b>in</b> <b>cities</b> <b>across</b> the country. The catalyst in Washington was the rumored arrest {{of a black}} man for rape; in four days of mob violence, white men randomly beat black people on the street, and pulled others off streetcars for attacks. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. Troops tried to restore order as the city closed saloons and theaters, but a summer rainstorm had a more dampening effect. A total of 15 people were killed: 10 whites, including two police officers; and five blacks. Fifty people were seriously wounded and another 100 less severely wounded. The NAACP protested to President Wilson.|$|E

On 17 March, Occupy Wall Street attempted to mark six months of the movement, by reoccupying Zuccotti Park, the location of the first Occupy camp. Protestors were soon cleared away by police, who made over 70 arrests. On 1 May, the Occupy movement marked a resurgence with a May Day general strike that took place <b>in</b> <b>cities</b> <b>across</b> the U.S., including New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles.

25|$|Traffic calming {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for decades <b>in</b> <b>cities</b> <b>across</b> Europe. For example, a living street (sometimes known as home zones or by the Dutch word woonerf, as the concept originated in the Netherlands) {{towards the end of}} the 1960s, initially in Delft, is a street in which the needs of car drivers are secondary to the needs of users of the street as a whole; traffic calming principles are integrated into their design. From the Netherlands, application spread rapidly to Germany, starting in North-Rhine Westphalia in 1976, becoming very widespread by the early 1980s. The ideas and techniques also spread to the UK {{towards the end of the}} 1980s, and practice there was advocated by academics such as Tim Pharaoh and Carmen Hass-Klau. The guidelines published by Devon County Council (of which Tim Pharaoh was the principal author) in 1991 were particularly well received.|$|E
25|$|The yatra also {{triggered}} religious {{violence in}} its wake, with riots <b>in</b> <b>cities</b> <b>across</b> North India. As a result, Advani {{was arrested by}} the government of Bihar as the yatra passed through that state, and 150,000 supporters were also arrested {{by the government of}} Uttar Pradesh. Tens of thousands of activists nonetheless reached Ayodhya and attempted to storm the mosque, resulting in a pitched battle with security forces which left 20 dead. These events caused further Hindu-Muslim riots to break out across the country, in which hundreds were killed. Muslims were often the victims of these riots, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Following these riots, the BJP withdrew its support to the central government, leading to early parliamentary elections. The BJP made significant gains in these elections, both at the national and the state level, {{on the back of the}} religious polarization that followed the yatra.|$|E
