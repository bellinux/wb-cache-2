5|$|Sadat's {{strategy}} {{was designed to}} achieve political success without needing a comprehensive military victory, and hence, and {{in view of the}} Egyptian military's marked inferiority to the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Forces, this required only a limited war.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Gaza began {{operating}} its {{own power}} plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Forces in 2006. Prior to power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was rebuilt by December 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{modernization}} program was announced. <b>Israeli</b> <b>defense</b> contractor Elbit Systems {{was chosen to}} provide 3-axis gyro-stabilization, and most probably the L7A2 105 mm cannon will be replaced with a more powerful 120mm cannon, like the L44 120 mm Cannon.

50|$|Former katsa Victor Ostrovsky {{has said}} that the {{direction}} Meir set Mossad on, namely that of focusing heavily on the people and operations of the PLO, took energy away from intelligence gathering on Israel's neighbors.

5|$|During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's {{infrastructure}} and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, {{it was a}} primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Forces (IDF). During the counteroffensive, the IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted for 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the wanted militants to various foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ismailia {{took place}} between the Egyptian Army and the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Forces (IDF) during the last stages of the Yom Kippur War during October 18–22, 1973, {{south of the city}} of Ismailia, on {{the west bank of the}} Suez Canal in Egypt. The battle itself took place as part of the larger IDF-launched Operation Abiray-Lev, in an attempt to seize Ismailia and thereby sever the {{logistical}} and supply lines of most of Egypt's Second Field Army across the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border between Israel and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, {{as a threat to the}} minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
50|$|During the June 1967 Six-Day War {{he served}} as the Deputy Chief of Staff in the IDF. In late 1968 he {{accepted}} Maj. Gen. Adan's proposal that a high sand-dune wall be built along the east bank of the Suez Canal to prevent the Egyptian military from observing <b>Israeli</b> <b>defenses</b> along the Suez Canal. Behind the sand dune a line of fixed fortifications was constructed. This {{became known as the}} Bar-Lev Line.|$|R
50|$|The division, {{formed as}} 7th Infantry Division, {{was a key}} {{component}} of the Syrian attack force in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, involved in some of the heaviest fighting in the Golan Heights, especially in the aptly named 'Valley of Tears'. The division, with its attached armoured brigade, lost a great number of tanks when trying on many accounts to rush the <b>Israeli</b> <b>defenses.</b> Omar Abrash was serving as the division commander.|$|R

5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the <b>Israeli</b> <b>defense</b> forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Lemon Tree {{was based}} on a real life incident. <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Minister Shaul Mofaz moved to the border within Israel and the {{occupied}} territories and security forces began cutting down the Lemon trees beside his house, arguing that it could be used by terrorists as a hiding place. The Palestinian family who owned the trees sued the minister and took the case {{all the way to the}} Israeli Supreme Court. They lost, and their trees had to be cut down. Riklis watched a news blurb about the case online. He then developed the story further in a fictional setting. Riklis explicitly designed the protagonist's part for actress Hiam Abbass.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{began on}} the night of June 6–7 with an {{artillery}} bombardment of Nitzanim, followed by an aerial bombardment and armored and infantry attacks. The main attack broke through the <b>Israeli</b> <b>defenses</b> at around 11:00; the Israelis retreated to a second position, and finally to a third position at 14:00. At 16:00, 105 Israelis surrendered to the Egyptian Army. Between June 7 and 10, the Battle of Hill 69 was fought nearby. The hill was captured by the Egyptians after a disorganized Israeli retreat.|$|R

5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, the Syrians started a frontal armored attack, consisting of 5 tanks, {{a number of}} armored vehicles and an infantry company. The Syrians pierced the <b>Israeli</b> <b>defense,</b> but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks that the Israelis managed to repair.|$|E

50|$|The Egyptian Army put {{great effort}} into finding {{a quick and}} {{effective}} way of breaching the <b>Israeli</b> <b>defenses.</b> The <b>Israelis</b> had built large 18 metre (59 foot) high sand walls with a 60 degree slope and reinforced with concrete at the water line. Egyptian engineers initially experimented with explosive charges and bulldozers to clear the obstacles, before a junior officer proposed using high pressure water cannons. The idea was tested and {{found to be a}} sound one, and several high pressure water cannons were imported from Britain and East Germany. The water cannons effectively breached the sand walls using water from the canal.|$|R
