40|$|Most commercially {{available}} nanoelectrospray ionization (NSI) sources possess well-defined electrical <b>ground</b> <b>points</b> in the mobile phase flow path. Inclusion of a <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> eliminates possible safety hazards involving source high voltage. Most home-built sources, however, lack a specifically defined ground point; the <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> often resides in injection valves, auto-samplers, or chromatographic pumps. Poorly placed ground-points affect analytical performance because high-voltage (HV) source current flows to this point. HV for on-line NSI is commonly provided through an electrode contacting the mobile phase upstream from the emitter. Current flow between HV supply, <b>ground</b> <b>point,</b> and nanoelectrospray plume (e. g., the current that flows from emitter to inlet) engenders the functional {{equivalent of a}} voltage-divider circuit. Relative impedance between the <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> and HV supply, and the impedance between the HV supply and NSI plume, determines effective spray voltage at the emitter tip. If relative impedance to the <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> is too low, effective voltage at the emitter sinks below the HV supply, affecting plume stability or even preventing spray formation; this obstacle is amplified in gradient elution because mobile phase surface tension changes during the analysis. Periodic or chaotic spray drop-out is a typical result. Plume formation and stability with gradient elution will be investigated using zero-dead-volume, optically clear, platinum electrode assemblies for HV and ground connections. Figure 1 shows a 150 μm platinum wire for HV contact at the junction between 75 and 50 μm ID fused-silica tubing. HV contact is made through a 150 μm platinum wire. Minimum requirements of tubing dimensions (length, inside diameter) between HV and <b>ground</b> <b>points,</b> while minimizing NSI threshold voltage disturbance, will be determined...|$|R

We triangulate the point cloud and segment the triangles into flat and steep triangles using a Discriminative Random Field (DRF) that uses a data-dependent label smoothness term. Regions are classified into ground and non-ground based on steepness in the regions and <b>ground</b> <b>points</b> are selected as <b>points</b> on <b>ground</b> triangles. Various post-processing steps are used to further identify flat regions as rooftops and treetops, and eliminate isolated features that affect the surface interpolation. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated in its effectiveness at labeling <b>ground</b> <b>points</b> and, more importantly, at determining the extracted bare-earth surface.

40|$|A {{capacitive}} electrocardiography (cECG) technique using a non-invasive ECG measuring {{technology that}} does not require direct contact between the sensor and the skin has attracted much interest. The system encounters several challenges when the sensor electrode and subject’s skin are weakly coupled. Because {{there is no direct}} physical contact between the subject and any <b>grounding</b> <b>point,</b> there is no discharge path for the built-up electrostatic charge. Subsequently, the electrostatic charge build-up can temporarily contaminate the ECG signal from being clearly visible; a stabilization period (3 – 15 min) is required for the measurement of a clean, stable ECG signal at low humidity levels (below 55 % relative humidity). Therefore, to obtain a clear ECG signal without noise and to reduce the ECG signal stabilization time to within 2 min in a dry ambient environment, we have developed a fabric electrode with embedded polymer (FEEP). The designed hygroscopic FEEP has an embedded superabsorbent polymer layer. The principle of FEEP as a conductive electrode is to provide humidity to the capacitive coupling to ensure strong coupling and to allow for the measurement of a stable, clear biomedical signal. The evaluation results show that hygroscopic FEEP is capable of rapidly measuring high-accuracy ECG signals with a higher SNR ratio...|$|E

40|$|In {{microscale}} separations, such as {{capillary electrophoresis}} and -liquid chromatography, the liquid flow rates {{are in the}} order of nanoliters per second. If such flow rates are to be interfaced with a mass spectrometer (MS) using electrospray (ES) ionization, without loss of separation efficiency, each fraction of the analyte zone must remain undisturbed by the high voltage contact necessary for ES. One design that accomplishes this is the pure sheathless approach, where a thin, vapor deposited metal film covers the outside of the electrospray emitter tip. This thesis describes the development of such sheathless emitters. The lifetimes of polymer embedded gold (“fairy dust”) or graphite (“black dust”) emitters were shown to by far exceed those of previously used conductive films. In addition, the production of emitters with these coatings was substantially simplified. The increase in durability was found to be due to enhanced resistance towards the electrochemical processes associated with ES. In analogy, the reasons for the limited durability of previously used methods were correlated with their tendency to oxidize, or be mechanically removed, during electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical processes associated with the electrospray potential were also found to seriously disturb analyses in which porous graphitic carbon was used as the separation medium. A proper choice of <b>grounding</b> <b>point</b> locations eliminated these disturbances. At last, the differences regarding analytical performance of several sheathless interface configurations, used in capillary liquid chromatography, were examined.

40|$|Critics have {{described}} psychology {{as a science}} impaired by disunity. The most recent special issue of Review of General Psychology sought to specifically address this concern, seeking perspectives {{from a wide range}} of theorists, each of whom offered their tradition's approach to how psychology as a whole may be integrated into a more unified whole. To continue this discussion, this article draws upon examples from the special issue, the disunity crisis literature, and wider writings in the philosophy of science, to explore the theoretical and conceptual divisions that foster ambiguity, confusion, and apparent irreconcilable differences between the disparate fields of psychology. The authors conclude that the majority of contemporary, scientific psychology is oriented toward a shared physical ontology, which can serve as a common <b>grounding</b> <b>point</b> from which the conceptual and theoretical differences of disparate fields may be meaningfully framed and evaluated. To this end, this article proposes that the various research traditions of psychology can be understood through their positions along a continuum of practical assumptions, which embodies the inherent conflict between two scientific priorities: metaphysical certainty (the safe end of the continuum) and practical experimental predictions (the risky end of the continuum). Three theoretical perspectives offered in the unification special issue are examined under this framework: situational realism (a distinctly safe approach), developmental evolutionary psychology (an intermediate approach), and the Tree of Knowledge unified theory (a relatively risky approach). The authors explore how the recommendations of each approach can be seen as a function of its position on the continuum of practical assumptions, and the implications of this understanding for future integrative efforts is discussed. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{ultimate}} {{purpose of}} this paper it to encourage international business scholars and managers {{to pay more attention to}} global social time when performing research and developing business strategy. Design/methodology/approach – Strategic reference point (SRP) theory is used as a foundation to assist in visualizing the meaning of social time in a global context. From this <b>grounding</b> <b>point,</b> the authors make specific suggestions about the importance of the topic despite it being largely overlooked in international research dating back to Hofstede. Findings – Time utility takes on a significantly different meaning when both a marketing manager 2 ̆ 7 s context and market are global. The conceptualization of time by different cultures can yield significantly different meanings based upon a culture 2 ̆ 7 s SRP(s) as to how social time is measured. Cultural differences necessitate having this flexible orientation towards social time to effectively develop and implement global marketing strategies. This research addresses the importance of breaking-down the concept of social time into its fundamental dimensions and developing strategic implementation steps using the dimensions of time as competitive tools in the global marketing arena. Research limitations/implications – A six-step process is developed to assist marketing researchers and managers in developing social time sensitive marketing strategies. Researchers and managers must be aware of the differences in social time perspectives and should analyze the situation to ascertain differences in the dimensions of each cross cultural group. An effort must be made to combine these varying social time perspectives into a consolidated social time foundation for the marketing team in the host country. Differences in social time must be taken into consideration when developing/executing strategies in other countries that have different social time perspectives. Originality/value – Breaking new ground in international business, this paper sets the ground work for the future study of up to 12 different streams of research important to the understanding of (global) time in international business.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} what found materiality in sculptural installation can reveal about poetic experiences {{of daily life}} under late stages of global capitalism. When contemporary junk pulled from the street or internet is assembled as art and placed into the gallery, visual poetry strikes at cultural ascriptions of value placed on materials. In zones reserved for societal and intellectual reverie, the poor form impels viewers to think. The thesis defines the operations of poor materiality in assemblage-based installation works by myself and other artists, to assess how they explore and critique notions of value. I define a performative theory of the poor material as a practice enacting a critique by emphasising arbitrariness, corruption and the flux of capitalism. In this practice the poor form leads with its agency in assemblages; intervening in the circulation of value. By inverting the processes through which value is attributed to aesthetic practice the poetics of the material actions play with inflation and devaluation of the symbolic economy of material tropes and the ‘gallery’. The body of the thesis comprises sub-chapters that engage thematically with poor materiality and its agencies. The sub-chapters can be read non-sequentially and are arranged non-hierarchically. Additionally, they cross-reference each other, formally asserting that this assemblage can be most robustly understood as a collective system. Materials found freely or at low cost are the key through-lines in each sub-chapter. Each assemblage contains modes of poetically ‘being in the world’, and this turn of phrase, borrowed from Martin Heidegger, is a <b>grounding</b> <b>point</b> for my practice. The assemblages define dwelling on {{the internet as a}} comparable activity to dwelling on the street, therefore materials collected from time spent on the internet help structure many of my works. My enquiry defines and discerns the specificity of material thresholds, documenting the complexity that underpins the poetry of practices that exist in proximate dialogue, such as in the work of Thea Djordjadze, David Hammons and Gabriel Kuri. In installations the range of poor objects and images employed pull back the curtain on ecological, social and economic issues. The research produces an account for the essentially contingent elements of poetry and value within the emergent agencies of these assemblages. As an assemblage has multiple points of vantage and is structured by contingent elements, this thesis is both a theory of assemblage-based artworks and an assemblage in its own right...|$|E
40|$|Research into "Strong" or "True" Artificial Intelligence, the {{long-term}} project {{to create an}} Artificial Intelligence that is intelligent {{in the same sense}} that humans are, has most often focussed on creating the tools with which an AI can mimic our intelligent behaviour. Conspicuously less attention has been given to the reasons why humans do the things they do: our motivation, or the rewards and punishments we experience. This thesis aims to rectify that shortcoming. Rather than equipping an AI with tools for reasoning in the hopes that it will develop "meaning" on its own, this thesis proposes an AI that uses "meaning" as an important learning tool with which it can create its own reasoning. To find the source of meaning, this thesis explores the source of intelligence: the necessity for adaptability. By converting “intelligence” to Jack Copeland’s “massive adaptability” and then reducing this “massive adaptability” to something called “bare-bone adaptability” this thesis finds a <b>grounding</b> <b>point</b> for Artificial Learning in biological Natural Selection and the monitoring of Homeostasis. To do so, it explores the learning behaviour of both single-celled organisms and complex organisms with a central nervous system (brain). Homeostasis and the internal rewards that can be founded on it come back time and again as an important source of organism behaviour and adaptation. By embodying an AI in a body that it needs to maintain, it can be equipped with the basic tools to establish connections between its environment and any internal consequences. It can evaluate its interactions with the environment based on the impact they have on its internal "homeostasis" and use these evaluations to create meaningful storage and to motivate adjustments of its behaviour. Homeostasis can also form the basis on which self-initiated actions can be undertaken. This thesis contains a tentative first model of a potential Artificial Neuron structure designed to monitor homeostasis and modulate Neural connections based on a Global Reward Signal, using inhibiting and excitatory Neurons. This model, called “Motivated Artificial Intelligence” (MAI), is capable of detecting homeostatic changes, prompting action selection and triggering evaluative feedback that enhances network memory. By viewing intelligence as a form of adaptability, it becomes more recognisable that intelligence is about establishing relations between internal representation, the external world and internal consequences. Due to the nature of adaptability, it becomes clear that the nature of the underlying matter is insignificant: whether an intelligence is built using atoms or bits does not affect its ability to develop meaning. After all: we do not expect the atoms that make up our body and with it our mind, to have any intrinsic meaning, it would be unfair to expect something different from symbols used to construct an Artificial Intelligence. This way, the philosophical Symbol Grounding Problem is not so much solved as bypassed: the Computer is no longer required to understand the symbols it manipulates or attach meaning to them. Meaning is instead found in the AI's complex web of valued interactions that is constructed upon the symbols...|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of dielectric liquids for high voltage insulation and power apparatus cooling is due to their greater electrical breakdown strength and thermal conductivity than gaseous insulators, while their ability to conform to complex geometries and self-heal means that they are often of more practical use than solid insulators. Transformer oil is a particularly important dielectric liquid. The issues surrounding its electrical breakdown {{have been the subject}} of extensive research. Much of this work has focused on the formation of electrical streamers. These are low-density conductive structures that form in regions of oil that are over-stressed by electric fields on the order of 1 x 108 (V/m) or greater. Once a streamer forms it tends to elongate, growing from the point of initiation towards a <b>grounding</b> <b>point.</b> The extent of a streamer's development depends upon the nature of the electrical excitation which caused it. Sustained over-excitation can result in a streamer bridging the oil gap between its point of origin and ground. When this happens an arc will form and electrical breakdown will occur. Streamers can form due to both positive and negative excitations. Positive streamers are considered more dangerous as they form at lower electric field levels and propagate with higher velocities than negative streamers. Historically, the modeling of streamer development has proved to be a very difficult task. Much of this difficulty relates to the identification of the relevant electrodynamic processes involved. In the first section of this thesis a comprehensive analysis of the charge generation mechanisms that could play a role in streamer development is presented. (cont.) The extent of the electrodynamics associated with Fowler-Nordheim charge injection, electric field dependent ionic dissociation (the Onsager Effect) and electric field dependent molecular ionization in electrically stressed transformer oil are assessed and it is shown that molecular ionization, which results in the development of an electric field wave, is the primary mechanism responsible for streamer development. A complete three carrier liquid-phase molecular ionization based streamer model is developed and solved for a positive needle electrode excitation using the COMSOL Multiphysics finite element simulation suite. The modification of the liquid-phase molecular ionization model to account for the two-phase nature of streamer development is described and the performance of both the liquid-phase and gas/liquid two-phase models are compared with experimental results reported in the literature. The second section of this thesis focuses on the insulating characteristics of transformer oil-based nanofluids. These nanofluids, which can be manufactured from a variety of materials, have been shown to possess some unique insulating characteristics. Earlier experimental work has shown that oil-based nanofluids manufactured using conductive nanoparticles have substantially higher positive voltage breakdown levels than that of pure oil. A comprehensive electrodynamic analysis of the processes which take place in electrically stressed transformer oil-based nanofluids is presented, which illustrates how conductive nanoparticles act as electron scavengers in electrically stressed transformer oil-based nanofluids. As part of this analysis, a completely general expression for the charging dynamics of a nanoparticle in transformer oil is developed. (cont.) The solutions for the charging dynamics of a range of nanoparticle materials are presented and the implications these charging dynamics have on the development of streamers in oil-based nanofluid is explained. To confirm the validity of the electrodynamic analysis, the electric field dependent molecular ionization model for streamers in pure oil is modified for use with transformer oil-based nanofluids. This model is solved for nanofluids manufactured using conductive and insulating particles and the results that are presented confirm the paradoxical fact that nanofluids manufactured from conductive nanoparticles have superior positive electrical breakdown performance to that of pure oil. The thesis concludes by exploring the possibility of developing simplified streamer models for both transformer oil and transformer oil-based nanofluids, which are computationally efficient and can be solved quickly meaning that they can be used as practical design tools. by Francis M.

That is to say, we intend to show those structures of both consciousness and the relation which man has to the world which present themselves as the generic conditions for the possibility of overcoming our "radical sol itude" in order that we may gain access to the mental 1 ife of an Other as other human subject. It is clear that in order for us to give expression to these accounts in a coherent manner, along with their relative merits, it will be necessary to develop the common features of any phenomenological theory of consdousness whatever. Therefore, our preliminary inquiry, subordinate to the larger theme, shall be into some of the epistemological results of the application of the phenomenological method used to develop a transcendental theory of consciousness. Inherent in this will be the deliniation of the exigency for making this an lIintentional ll theory. We will then be able to see how itis possible to overcome transcendentally the Other as an object merely given among other merely given objects, and further, how this other is constituted specifically as other ego. The problem of transcendental intersubjectivity and its constitution in experience can be viewed as one of the most compelling, if not the most polemical of issues in phenomenology. To be sure, right from the beginning we are forced to ask a number of questions regarding Husserl's responses to the problem within the context of the methodological genesis of the Cartesian Meditations, and The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. This we do in order to set the stage for amplification. First, we ask, has Husserl lived up to his goal, in this connexion, of an apodictic result? We recall that in his Logos article of 1911 he adminished that previous philosophy does not have at its disposal a merely incomplete and, in particular instances, imperfect doctrinal system; it simply has none whatever. Each and every question is herein controverted, each position is a matter of individual conviction, of the interpretation given byaschool, of a "point of view". 1. Moreover in the same article he writes that his goal is a philosophical system of doctrine that, after the gigantic preparatory work. of generations, really be-. gins from the ground up with a foundation free from doubt and rises up like any skilful construction, wherein stone is set upon store, each as solid as the other, in accord with directive insights. 2. Reflecting upon the fact that he foresaw "preparatory work of generations", we perhaps should not expect that he would claim that his was the last word on the matter of intersubjectivity. Indeed, with 2. 'Edmund Husserl, lIPhilosophy as a Rigorous Science" in Phenomenology and theCrisis 6 fPhilosophy, trans". with an introduction by Quentin Lauer (New York. : Harper & Row, 1965) pp. 74 [...] 5. 2 Ibid. pp. 75 [...] 6. 3. the relatively small amount of published material by Husserl on the subject we can assume that he himself was not entirely satisfied with his solution. The second question we have is that if the transcendental reduction is to yield the generic and apodictic structures of the relationship of consciousness to its various possible objects, how far can we extend this particular constitutive synthetic function to intersubjectivity where the objects must of necessity always remain delitescent? To be sure, the type of 'object' here to be considered is unlike any other which might appear in the perceptual field. What kind of indubitable evidence will convince us that the characteristic which we label "alter-ego" and which we attribute to an object which appears to resemble another body which we have never, and can never see the whole of (namely, our own bodies), is nothing more than a cleverly contrived automaton? What;s the nature of this peculiar intentional function which enables us to say "you think just as I do"? If phenomenology is to take such great pains to reduce the takenfor- granted, lived, everyday world to an immanent world of pure presentation, we must ask the mode of presentation for transcendent sub [...] jectivities. And in the end, we must ask if Husserl's argument is not reducible to a case (however special) of reasoning by analogy, and if so, tf this type of reasoning is not so removed from that from whtch the analogy is made that it would render all transcendental intersubjective understandtng impos'sible? 2. HistoticalandEidetic Priority: The Necessity of Abstraction 4. The problem is not a simple one. What is being sought are the conditions for the poss ibili:ty of experi encing other subjects. More precisely, the question of the possibility of intersubjectivity is the question of the essence of intersubjectivity. What we are seeking is the absolute route from one solitude to another. Inherent in this programme is the ultimate discovery of the meaning of community. That this route needs be lIabstract" requires some explanation. It requires little explanation that we agree with Husserl in the aim of fixing the goal of philosophy on apodictic, unquestionable results. This means that we seek a philosophical approach which is, though, not necessarily free from assumptions, one which examines and makes explicit all assumptions in a thorough manner. It would be helpful at this point to distinguish between lIeidetic ll priority, and JlhistoricallJpriority in order to shed some light on the value, in this context, of an abstraction. 3 It is true that intersubjectivity is mundanely an accomplished fact, there havi. ng been so many mi. llions of years for humans to beIt eve in the exi s tence of one another I s abili ty to think as they do. But what we seek is not to study how this proceeded historically, but 3 Cf• Maurice Natanson;·TheJburne in 'Self, a Stud in Philoso h and Social Role (Santa Cruz, U. of California Press, 1970. rather the logical, nay, "psychological" conditions under which this is possible at all. It is therefore irrelevant to the exigesis of this monograph whether or not anyone should shrug his shoulders and mumble IIwhy worry about it, it is always already engaged". By way of an explanation of the value of logical priority, we can find an analogy in the case of language. Certainly the language 5. in a spoken or written form predates the formulation of the appropriate grammar. However, this grammar has a logical priority insofar as it lays out the conditions from which that language exhibits coherence. The act of formulating the grammar is a case of abstraction. The abstraction towards the discovery of the conditions for the poss; bi 1 ity of any experiencing whatever, for which intersubjective experience is a definite case, manifests itself as a sort of "grammar". This "grammar" is like the basic grammar of a language in the sense that these "rulesil are the ~ priori conditions for the possibility of that experience. There is, we shall say, an "eidetic priority", or a generic condition which is the logical antecedent to the taken-forgranted object of experience. In the case of intersubjectivity we readily grant that one may mundanely be aware of fellow-men as fellowmen, but in order to discover how that awareness is possible it is necessary to abstract from the mundane, believed-in experience. This process of abstraction is the paramount issue; the first step, in the search for an apodictic basis for social relations. How then is this abstraction to be accomplished? What is the nature of an abstraction which would permit us an Archimedean point, absolutely grounded, from which we may proceed? The answer can be discovered in an examination of Descartes in the light of Husserl's criticism. 3. The Impulse for Scientific Philosophy. The Method to which it Gives Rise. 6. Foremost in our inquiry is the discovery of a method appropriate to the discovery of our <b>grounding</b> <b>point.</b> For the purposes of our investigations, i. e., that of attempting to give a phenomenological view of the problem of intersubjectivity, it would appear to be of cardinal importance to trace the attempt of philosophy predating Husserl, particularly in the philosophy of Descartes, at founding a truly IIscientific ll philosophy. Paramount in this connexion would be the impulse in the Modern period, as the result of more or less recent discoveries in the natural sciences, to found philosophy upon scientific and mathematical principles. This impulse was intended to culminate in an all-encompassing knowledge which might extend to every realm of possible thought, viz., the universal science ot IIMathexis Universalis ll • 4 This was a central issue for Descartes, whose conception of a universal science would include all the possible sciences of man. This inclination towards a science upon which all other sciences might be based waS not to be belittled by Husserl, who would appropriate 4 This term, according to Jacab Klein, was first used by Barocius, the translator of Proclus into Latin, to designate the highest mathematical discipline.. 7. it himself in hopes of establishing, for the very first time, philosophy as a "rigorous science". It bears emphasizing that this in fact was the drive for the hardening of the foundations of philosophy, the link between the philosophical projects of Husserl and those of the philosophers of the modern period. Indeed, Husserl owes Descartes quite a debt for indicating the starting place from which to attempt a radical, presupositionless, and therefore scientific philosophy, in order not to begin philosophy anew, but rather for the first time. 5 The aim of philosophy for Husserl is the search for apodictic, radical certitude. However while he attempted to locate in experience the type of necessity which is found in mathematics, he wished this necessity to be a function of our life in the world, as opposed to the definition and postulation of an axiomatic method as might be found in the unexpurgated attempts to found philosophy in Descartes. Beyond the necessity which is involved in experiencing the world, Husserl was searching for the certainty of roots, of the conditi'ons which underl ie experience and render it pOssible. Descartes believed that hi~ MeditatiOns had uncovered an absolute ground for knowledge, one founded upon the ineluctable givenness of thinking which is present even when one doubts thinking. Husserl, in acknowledging this procedure is certainly Cartesian, but moves, despite this debt to Descartes, far beyond Cartesian philosophy i. n his phenomenology (and in many respects, closer to home). 5 Cf. Husserl, Philosophy as a Rigorous Science, pp. 74 ff. 8 But wherein lies this Cartesian jumping off point by which we may vivify our theme? Descartes, through inner reflection, saw that all of his convictions and beliefs about the world were coloured in one way or another by prejudice: [...] . at the end I feel constrained to reply that there is nothing in a all that I formerly believed to be true, of which I cannot in some measure doubt, and that not merely through want of thought or through levity, but for reasons which are very powerful and maturely considered; so that henceforth I ought not the less carefully to refrain from giving credence to these opinions than to that which is manifestly false, if I desire to arrive at any certainty (in the sciences). 6 Doubts arise regardless of the nature of belief - one can never completely believe what one believes. Therefore, in order to establish absolutely grounded knowledge, which may serve as the basis fora "universal Science", one must use a method by which one may purge oneself of all doubts and thereby gain some radically indubitable insight into knowledge. Such a method, gescartes found, was that, as indicated above by hi,s own words, of II radical doubt" which "forbids in advance any judgemental use of (previous convictions and) which forbids taking any position with regard to their val idi'ty.,, 7 This is the method of the "sceptical epoche ll, the method of doubting all which had heretofor 6 Descartes,Meditations on First Philosophy, first Med., (Libera 1 Arts Press, New York, 1954) trans. by L. LaFl eur. pp. 10. 7 Husserl,CrisiS of Eliroeari SCiences and Trariscendental Phenomenology, (Northwestern U. Press, Evanston, 1 7,p. 76. 9. been considered as belonging to the world, including the world itself. What then is left over? Via the process of a thorough and all-inclusive doubting, Descartes discovers that the ego which performs the epoche, or "reduction", is excluded from these things which can be doubted, and, in principle provides something which is beyond doubt. Consequently this ego provides an absolute and apodictic starting point for founding scientific philosophy. By way of this abstention. of bel ief, Desca'rtes managed to reduce the worl d of everyday 1 ife as bel ieved in, to mere 'phenomena', components of the rescogitans:. Thus:, having discovered his Archimedean point, the existence of the ego without question, he proceeds to deduce the 'rest' of the world with the aid of innate ideas and the veracity of God. In both Husserl and Descartes the compelling problem is that of establ ishing a scientific, apodictic phi'losophy based upon presuppos itionless groundwork [...] Husserl, in thi. s regard, levels the charge at Descartes that the engagement of his method was not complete, such that hi. S: starting place was not indeed presupositionless, and that the validity of both causality and deductive methods were not called into question i. 'n the performance of theepoche. In this way it is easy for an absolute evidence to make sure of the ego as: a first, "absolute, indubitablyexisting tag~end of the worldll, and it is then only a matter of inferring the absolute subs. tance and the other substances which belon. g to the world, along with my own mental substance, using a logically val i d deductive procedure. 8 8 Husserl, E.;' Cartesian 'Meditation;, trans.

Our approach represents an enhancement {{of the existing}} DTM extraction algorithm Multi-directional and Slope Dependent (MSD) by proposing parameters that are more reliable for the selection of ground pixels and the pixelwise classification. To achieve this, four main steps are implemented: Firstly, 8 well-distributed scanlines are used to search for minima as a <b>ground</b> <b>point</b> within a pre-defined filtering window size. These selected <b>ground</b> <b>points</b> are stored with their positions on a 2 D surface to create a network of <b>ground</b> <b>points.</b> Then, an initial DTM is created using an interpolation method to fill the gaps in the 2 D surface. Afterwards, a pixel to pixel comparison between the initial DTM and the original DSM is performed utilising pixelwise classification of ground and non-ground pixels by applying a vertical height threshold. Finally, the pixels classified as non-ground are removed and the remaining holes are filled. The approach is evaluated using the Vaihingen benchmark dataset provided by the ISPRS working group III/ 4. The evaluation includes the comparison of our approach, denoted as Network of <b>Ground</b> <b>Points</b> (NGPs) algorithm, with the DTM created based on MSD {{as well as a}} reference DTM generated from LiDAR data.
