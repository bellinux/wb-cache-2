The {{first is that}} the performance of event-based hydrologic models for ephemeral stream networks declines significantly as watershed size increases. The second is that no single model is capable of simulating runoff, erosion, and geomorphic response in the channel network for multiple consecutive events. A diffusion-wave routing subroutine was developed for the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (K_INEROS 2) using a four-point iterative solution to the modified variable-parameter Muskingum-Cunge (MVPMC 4) technique. It was tested against kinematic-wave routing at scales ranging from 0. 05 to 150 km² on the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in southeastern Arizona. Analyses demonstrated that MVPMC 4 routing significantly improves simulated outflow hydrographs for small to moderate events on watersheds that are 95 km 2 and larger. A geomorphic model was developed by modifying KINEROS 2 to compute width, <b>depth</b> and slope <b>adjustments</b> from computed changes in sediment storage at each time step.

Right: Layer-aware {{dragging}} allows {{the user to}} drag over (shift-up) or under (shift-down) a colliding object in the screen space. We introduce layer operations for single-view 3 D deformable object manipulation, in which the user can control the depth order of layered 3 D objects resting on a flat ground with simple clicks and drags, as in 2 D drawing systems. We present two interaction techniques based on this idea and describe their implementation. The first technique is explicit layer swap. The user clicks the target layer, and the system swaps the layer with the one directly underneath it. The second technique is layer-aware dragging. As the user drags the object, the system adjusts its depth automatically to pass over or under a colliding object in the screen space, according to user control. Although the user interface is 2. 5 D, all scene representations are true 3 D, and thus the system naturally supports local layering, self-occlusions, and folds. Internally, the system dynamically computes the apparent layer structure in the current configuration and makes appropriate <b>depth</b> <b>adjustments</b> to obtain the desired results.

An important design parameter is {{the depth of the}} de-jitter buffer since it influences two important parameters controlling voice quality, namely voice-path delay and packet loss probability. In this paper, we propose and study several schemes for optimally adjusting the depth of the de-jitter buffer. In addition to de-jitter-buffer <b>depth</b> <b>adjustments</b> within a call, the initial value and rates of changes of the de-jitter buffer depth are allowed to depend on the class of the call and are adaptively adjusted (upwards or downwards) for every new call based on voice-path delay and packet loss probability measurements over one or more previous calls. Parameter adjustments are geared towards either (a) minimizing voice-path delay while maintaining a packet loss probability objective, or (b) maximizing R-factor, an objective measure of voice quality that depends both on the voice-path delay and the packet loss probability. Using simulation models and measured packet delay traces, it is shown that adaptive schemes perform better than static ones and adaptive schemes with learning perform better than ones without learning. q 2003 Published by Elsevier B.

5000|$|Although {{there were}} various plans for submersibles or {{submarines}} during the Middle Ages, the Englishman William Bourne designed {{one of the}} first prototype submarines in 1578. This was to be a completely enclosed boat that could be submerged and rowed beneath the surface. Comprising a completely enclosed wooden vessel sheathed in waterproofed leather, it was to be submerged by using hand operated wooden screw thread adjustable plungers pressing against flexible leather bags located at the sides in order to increase or decrease the volume of water to adjust the buoyancy of the craft. The sketch (left) suggests that the <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> was by means of a crankset projecting above the surface. There is no obvious accommodation for crew. The first submersible to be actually built in modern times was constructed in 1605 by Magnus Pegelius. Its fate was to become buried in mud. In 1596 the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his Secret Inventions the following: [...] "These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform."It's unclear whether or not Napier ever carried out his plans. Henry Briggs, who was professor of mathematics at Gresham College, London, and later at Oxford, was a friend of Napier, whom he visited in 1615 and 1616, and was also an acquaintance of Cornelius Jacobszoon Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England, who designed and built the first successful submarine in 1620. Hence, it is not impossible that {{it was because of the}} interest taken by Napier in the submarine that Briggs came in touch with Drebbel.Drebbel's submarine was propelled by oars and is thought to have incorporated floats with tubes to allow air down to the rowers. The precise nature of this submarine is unclear, it may be possible that it resembled a bell towed by a boat. Two improved types were tested in the River Thames between 1620 and 1624.

More recently, with {{the availability of}} commodity Virtual Reality (VR) products, immersive video content is receiving even more interest. A wide spread adoption of immersive devices and displays is hindered {{by the lack of}} content that matches the user expectations. Producing immersive videos is far more costly and time-consuming than regular 2 D videos, which makes it challenging and thus rarely attempted, especially for live events, such as sports games. In addition, immersive content needs to be adapted for viewing on different displays/devices. To address these challenges, we first propose a new system for 3 D video streaming that provides automatic <b>depth</b> <b>adjustments</b> as one of its key features. Our system takes into account both the content and the display type in order to customize 3 D videos and optimize the viewing experience. Our stereoscopic video streaming system was implemented, deployed and tested with real users. Results show that between 60 % to 70 % of the shots can benefit from our system and more than 25 % depth enhancement can be achieved. Next, we propose a novel, data-driven method that converts 2 D videos to 3 D by transferring depth information from a database of similar 3 D videos. Our method then reconstructs the depth map while ensuring temporal coherency using a spatio-temporal formulation of Poisson reconstruction. Results show that our method produces high-quality 3 D videos that are almost indistinguishable from videos shot by stereo cameras, while achieving up to 20 % improvement in the perceived depth compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Furthermore, we extend our work in the direction of VR, and propose using video feeds from regular broadcasting cameras to generate sports VR content. We generate a wide-angle panorama by utilizing the motion of the main camera. We then use various techniques to remove the parallax, align all video feeds, and overlay them on the panorama.

Second, the variational approach underlying the LAP provides a more straightforward and simpler fuzzy-object orientated method for solving river regime problems than do the various complex Newtonian formulations.

40|$|Designing an {{efficient}} deployment method to guarantee optimal monitoring quality {{is one of}} the key topics in underwater sensor networks. At present, a realistic approach of deployment involves adjusting the depths of nodes in water. One of the typical algorithms used in such process is the self-deployment <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithm (SDDA). This algorithm mainly focuses on maximizing network coverage by constantly adjusting node depths to reduce coverage overlaps between two neighboring nodes, and thus, achieves good performance. However, the connectivity performance of SDDA is irresolute. In this paper, we propose a <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithm based on connected tree (CTDA). In CTDA, the sink node is used as the first root node to start building a connected tree. Finally, the network can be organized as a forest to maintain network connectivity. Coverage overlaps between the parent node and the child node are then reduced within each sub-tree to optimize coverage. The hierarchical strategy is used to adjust the distance between the parent node and the child node to reduce node movement. Furthermore, the silent mode is adopted to reduce communication cost. Simulations show that compared with SDDA, CTDA can achieve high connectivity with various communication ranges and different numbers of nodes. Moreover, it can realize coverage as high as that of SDDA with various sensing ranges and numbers of nodes but with less energy consumption. Simulations under sparse environments show that the connectivity and energy consumption performances of CTDA are considerably better than those of SDDA. Meanwhile, the connectivity and coverage performances of CTDA are close to those <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithms base on connected dominating set (CDA), which is an algorithm similar to CTDA.
