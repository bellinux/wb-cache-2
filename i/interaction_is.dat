50|$|Herb-drug <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> drug <b>interactions</b> {{that occur}} between herbal {{medicines}} and conventional drugs. These types of <b>interactions</b> may <b>be</b> {{more common than}} drug-drug interactions because herbal medicines often contain multiple pharmacologically active ingredients, while conventional drugs typically contain only one. Some such <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> clinically significant, although most herbal remedies are not associated with drug interactions causing serious consequences. Most herb-drug <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> moderate in severity. The most commonly implicated conventional drugs in herb-drug <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> warfarin, insulin, aspirin, digoxin, and ticlopidine, due to their narrow therapeutic indices. The most commonly implicated herbs involved in such <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> those containing St. John’s Wort, magnesium, calcium, iron, or ginkgo.|$|R

5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption—shortened to Redemption—is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) presented {{primarily from}} the third-person perspective; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first-person mode used to view the character's immediate environment is available. The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area. The game follows a linear, mission-based structure. <b>Interaction</b> <b>is</b> achieved by using a mouse to click on an enemy or environmental object to attack it or to activate it. <b>Interaction</b> <b>is</b> context based; clicking on an enemy initiates combat, while clicking on a door causes it to open or close.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> preserved.|$|E

5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E

The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by {{the hand of a}} hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city.

5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E
5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E

5|$|The favoured {{model for}} the enzyme–substrate <b>{{interaction}}</b> <b>is</b> the induced fit model. This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain; by proximity and orientation; by active-site proton donors or acceptors; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling.|$|E

40|$|Background: Shape {{complementarity}} and non-covalent <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to}} drive protein-ligand interaction. To date protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA <b>interactions</b> <b>were</b> systematically investigated, {{which is in}} contrast to interactions with small ligands. We investigate the role of covalent and non-covalent bonds in protein-small ligand interactions using a comprehensive dataset of 2, 320 complexes. Methodology and Principal Findings: We show that protein-ligand <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> governed by different forces for different ligand types, i. e., protein-organic compound <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> governed by hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and covalent bonds; protein-metal ion <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> dominated by electrostatic force and coordination bonds; protein-anion <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> established with electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts; and protein-inorganic cluster <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> driven by coordination bonds. We extracted several frequently occurring atomiclevel patterns concerning these interactions. For instance, 73 % of investigated covalent bonds were summarized with just three patterns in which bonds are formed between thiol of Cys and carbon or sulfur atoms of ligands, and nitrogen of Lys and carbon of ligands. Similar patterns were found for the coordination bonds. Hydrogen bonds occur in 67 % of proteinorganic compound complexes and 66 % of them are formed between NH- group of protein residues and oxygen atom of ligands.
