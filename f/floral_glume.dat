40|$|We {{identified}} the rice floral organ development mutant, termed as open hull and male sterile 1 (ohms 1), from the progeny of the indica restorer line Zhonghui 8015 treated with 60 Co γ-ray irradiation. The ohms 1 mutant exhibited an open hull and lemma- and palea-like structure conversion between the anthers and stigma, {{which resulted in}} the ohms 1 mutant spikelet showing ‘tridentate lemma’. The ohms 1 mutant was entirely sterile but had 60 %– 70 % fertile pollen. Genetic analysis and gene mapping showed that ohms 1 was controlled by a single recessive gene, and the mutant gene was fine-mapped to a 42 -kb interval on the short arm of chromosome 3 between markers KY 2 and KY 29. Sequence analysis of the four open reading frames in this region revealed that the mutant carried a single nucleotide transformation (A to G) at the last base of the fifth intron, which was likely corresponded to ohms 1 phynotype, in an MIKC type MADS-box gene OsMADS 1 (LOC_Os 03 g 11614). Enzyme digestion and cDNA sequencing further indicated that the variable splicing was responsible for the deletion of the sixth exon in ohms 1, but no structural changes in the MADS domain or amino acid frame shifts appeared. Additionally, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR analysis showed that the OsMADS 1 expression level decreased significantly in the ohms 1 mutant. The expression levels of rice flowering factors and <b>floral</b> <b>glume</b> development-related genes also changed significantly. These results demonstrate that OsMADS 1 may {{play an important role in}} rice floral organ development, particularly in <b>floral</b> <b>glume</b> development and floret primordium differentiation...|$|E
50|$|Scald is a foliar {{disease of}} barley {{affecting}} {{the leaves and}} sheaths of the plant; however, lesions may also occur oncoleoptiles, <b>glumes,</b> <b>floral</b> bracts and awns. Initial symptoms are oval, water-soaked, grayish-green spots, 1.0-1.5 cm long.As the disease develops, the centers of the lesions dry and bleach, becoming light gray, tan, or white with a dark brownmargin. The lesions are not delimited by the leaf veins and often coalesce.|$|R
40|$|Cereal crop {{residues}} represent {{the most important}} inoculum source {{for the development of}} Fusarium head blight in wheat and barley. There is little information on the level of colonization or the contribution of different parts of the wheat residue to inoculum. In this study, wheat residue tissues including nodes, <b>floral</b> bracts (<b>glumes,</b> lemmas, and paleae), and kernels were evaluated for Gibberella zeae colonization and inoculum production. Gibberella zeae was recovered from all residue tissues. Colonization, determined as the percentage of each residue fraction colonized by G. zeae, was greater on nodes than on kernels and floral bracts. Ascospores were produced by G. zeae on all residue tissues studied. Tissues differed in the quantity of ascospores produced with kernels supporting the development of more ascospores per gram of tissue than nodes and floral bracts. Information from this study may assist in the understanding of colonization and ascospores production of G. zeae in different residue tissues...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on components of resistance to sorghum midge on four resistant (DJ 6514, AF 28, TAM 2566 and IS 15107) and two susceptible cultivars (CSH 1 and Swarna). Data were recorded on the numbers of eggs, larvae, emerged adults and grain damage in panicles of different genotypes infested with 60 midge females/panicle under no-choice conditions. The size of <b>floral</b> parts (<b>glume,</b> lemma, palea, lodicule, stigma, style, ovary and anther), rate of grain development and tannin content of grain were measured. The lengths of glume gl and 82, lemma L 1 and L 2, palea, lodicule, anther, style and stigma were positively associated with susceptibility to sorghum midge. Rate of grain development (between 3 rd and 7 th day after anthesis) was negatively associated with susceptibility to sorghum. Tannin content of grain was also negatively correlated with midge susceptibility, although there were distinct exceptions (e. g. DJ 6514 is highly resistant bur has a low tannin content) ...|$|R
