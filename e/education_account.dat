50|$|The rate {{increase}} {{was accompanied by}} an offset package to help Singaporeans {{with the increase in}} GST. The package would cost the government $4 billion over five years. The government argued that the offset package would help the majority of Singaporeans offset their increased GST costs for several years. The offset package consisted of direct transfer benefits, in the form of cash payouts (GST credits, growth dividends, senior citizens' bonuses), CPF top-ups (post-secondary <b>education</b> <b>account</b> top-ups for students, Medisave top-ups for older Singaporeans), and rebates (on utilities and public housing service & conservancy charges). Those who earned less or lived in smaller homes received more benefits. The government also argued that the Workfare Income Supplement, a wage subsidy, would provide significant support for lower-income workers on a continuing basis even after the GST offsets have been distributed.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{students}} {{in urban areas}} also depend on public transportation to get to and from school. The American Public Transportation Association found that trips to school, including elementary, secondary and higher <b>education,</b> <b>account</b> for over 10% of all trips, the second largest source after trips to work which account for 59% of trips. [...] A joint report by Harvard University’s Civil Rights Project and the Center for Community Change found evidence that {{lack of access to}} transportation may mean having to miss school. For example, high school {{students in}} Oakland and El Cerrito, California, testified that they needed free transit passes because their families sometimes had to choose between food and transit fare. [...] Most major transit systems in the United States offer discounted fares and passes to elementary and secondary students like the WMATA, CTA, LA Metro, New York MTA, and the Massachusetts MBTA. Some restrict travel to certain hours on school days, while others do not. A few also offer discounted fares to college and graduate students, e.g., the LA Metro. Some universities have implemented U-Pass programs that provide students unlimited access to local transit.|$|E

We link both programs through a tax-transfer system that is also sensitive to labor market distortions. We analyze the impact that alternative pension reforms have, through the political process, on publicly financed education. We explain how changes in the pension system design affect the link between the two programs and also labor market incentives. These effects, if they exist, act in opposite directions. Overall, we find that most proposals that entail a partial privatization of pensions reduce the willingness of the society to fund public education...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the changes, if any, that have taken place in terms of the social {{relevance}} of <b>accounting</b> <b>education</b> in Australian Universities. In order to comment on the notion of social relevance, this paper examines the notion of alibis as put forward by Simon (2001). The past is reviewed in terms of the roles that <b>accounting</b> <b>education</b> has played in the Australian community. It is concluded that university <b>education,</b> and specifically <b>accounting</b> <b>education,</b> in an Australian context has never entirely been what Simon (2001) would label as ‘traditional scholarly’ (his first alibi). A second alibi, ‘economic utilitarian’, is found to be dominant for <b>accounting</b> <b>education,</b> in line with most university education today. A final section of the paper briefly reviews the way forward for <b>accounting</b> <b>education</b> which would fall under the alibi of ‘modernist liberal’.
