5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> the contiguous United States {{from the}} Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, {{and the eastern}} Pacific Ocean. The highest rainfall totals in {{the country have been}} measured across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The Northern {{industrial}} zone {{is located}} on Highway 41 and includes various industry including an oil refinery, {{which is one of}} only two in the country. The heavy industry zone located south of the Lachish River was once the main industrial center in Ashdod. Recently, however, leisure facilities <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> the area. There is still some industry here, however, such as a Teva Pharmaceutical Industries plant, construction components producer Ashtrom, and Solbar a soybean oil producer. Ashdod is also home to Elta, a part of Israel Aircraft Industries where radar equipment, electronic warfare systems, and ELINT are developed.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E

5|$|During the 2013 preseason, Hemingway led the Chiefs in receptions and touchdowns. He {{seemed to}} <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> the fourth wide {{receiver}} position behind Dwayne Bowe, Donnie Avery, and Dexter McCluster. In the 2013 Chiefs season opener, {{he caught a}} touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had his college freshman season quarterback Chad Henne and his redshirt senior season quarterback Denard Robinson on their roster. The reception, which came from Alex Smith, was Hemingway's first in the NFL. Hemingway had a three-reception game that included the game's opening score on December 1 against the Denver Broncos. In {{the final game of}} the season, he had 5 receptions for 45 yards, giving him 13 receptions and 125 yards for the season. Hemingway also posted 2 receptions for the Chiefs in the 2013–14 NFL playoffs against Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Whites {{represented}} 94.7% of Boston's population. From the 1950s {{to the end}} of the 20th century, {{the proportion}} of non-Hispanic whites in the city declined; in 2000, non-Hispanic whites made up 49.5% of the city's population, making the city majority-minority for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced significant gentrification, in which affluent whites <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> formerly non-white areas. In 2006, the US Census Bureau estimated that non-Hispanic whites again formed a slight majority. But , in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available, the non-white population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding US Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic white population of 47 percent (some reports give slightly lower figures).|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub {{with a focus on}} the Digital Creative sector. As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of these companies <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario. London is also home to Diply, which is ranked among the top websites on the Internet, video game companies Big Viking Games and Digital Extremes, and Voices.com, which provides voiceover artists a platform to advertise and sell their services to those looking for voiceover work.|$|E
