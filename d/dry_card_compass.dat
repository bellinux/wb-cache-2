50|$|In 1870 Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{designed}} his <b>dry</b> <b>card</b> standard <b>compass,</b> which completely replaced {{all previous}} designs. Wilson and Gillie started as agents for the Thomson compass, but later J.W. Gillie, using similar principles, redesigned the compass suspension and patented the ‘UNIT’ standard compass. It became popular with local shipowners and shipbuilders.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} forces {{of a few}} nations, notably the United States Army, continue to issue field compasses with magnetized <b>compass</b> dials or <b>cards</b> instead of needles. A magnetic <b>card</b> <b>compass</b> is usually equipped with an optical, lensatic, or prismatic sight, which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective (see photo). Magnetic <b>card</b> <b>compass</b> designs normally require a separate protractor tool {{in order to take}} bearings directly from a map.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> is {{an orange}} or yellow, credit-card-sized {{contactless}} smartcard which {{can hold a}} transit pass, such as a Day Pass, a 14-Day Pass, etc. The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> card must tapped on an electronic <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> validator when entering and transferring within the system in order to validate the fare. [...] <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> readers are integrated in bus fareboxes, and standalone readers are located just outside the paid-area of Trolley and rail stations.|$|R
50|$|TransLink {{introduced}} a smart card based {{electronic payment system}} called <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> to replace existing monthly and daily passes, tickets and cash. Translink has been slowly phasing in use of the <b>Compass</b> <b>Card.</b> Summer 2015 saw most post-secondary school students begin using the fare cards. Translink rolled out the card {{to the general population}} in November 2015. The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> has a C$6 refundable deposit. It is a NXP Mifare DESFire EV1 card.|$|R
50|$|In addition, Translink {{confirmed}} in October 2013 {{that the cost}} overrun for the <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> system had reached $23 million due to delay related inflation and unanticipated scope creep. The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> system had been budgeted at $171 million, but had risen to $194 million.|$|R
50|$|Once users {{obtain a}} <b>Compass</b> <b>card</b> with an {{adequate}} pass or {{an amount of}} stored value, they can tap in to enter a bus or transit station and tap out as they leave (except for buses). Tapping involves lightly touching the <b>Compass</b> <b>card</b> flat against a card reader.|$|R

25|$|On April 4, 2016, Translink's new fare gates were {{implemented}} for ridership on SkyTrain and SeaBus. To open the fare gates, to enter or exit the system, a <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> must be used. <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards</b> {{may be used}} to pay fares on and buses, although FareSaver tickets may still be used on buses. Buses continue issue paper passes for fares paid in cash. Neither FareSavers nor the transfer tickets {{may be used to}} open fare gates. <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards</b> work on all transit services using a tap in method to pay fares. Tap out however is not required on buses. The cards may be loaded with monthly passes, day passes, or stored value, or any combination, with the ability to auto-load the fare choice. Annual passes have been eliminated.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{concept is}} that the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> should not turn, even though it appears to always “swing” to magnetic north. The housing that holds the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> turns around the card, which remains pointing {{in the same direction}} (Magnetic North) all the time. There are occasions when the card does turn, but this is when it has been stuck or the compass is turned over, and the card is unable to remain aligned with the magnetic field.|$|R

A lubber line, {{which can be a}} marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the <b>compass</b> <b>card.</b> Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points.
