40|$|Using {{confidential}} data from US manufacturing firms' tax returns and <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service (IRS) audit adjustments, Mills (1998) tests, and finds support for, her hypothesis that IRS audit adjustments increase as the book-tax differences increase. We test Mills' hypothesis using {{confidential data}} obtained from the New Zealand <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> (hereafter <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue).</b> Confidential data provide the key variable of interest, <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue's</b> proposed audit adjustment, which is not available from public sources. These data provide the exact audit adjustment amounts, eliminating measurement errors inherent in proxy variables, and enable a temporal alignment of the book-tax differences with the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> audit adjustments, thereby enhancing the internal validity {{of the relation between}} book-tax differences and <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> audit adjustments. Because the results of our study using New Zealand data, another time period, a more diverse set of firms, and a different institutional environment are consistent with those of Mills, we argue for the generalizability of Mills' hypothesis that proposed audit adjustments are positively related to the excess of book income over taxable income.

40|$|The {{approach}} to administering the taxation laws by the New Zealand <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> Department (<b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue)</b> {{is founded on}} the responsive regulation model. Pursuant to the model, <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> describes {{its relationship with the}} tax profession as collaborative or even a partnership. The model has been borrowed from the Australian initiatives. However, there is evidence that the partnership model has been very patchy in its application, both over time and depending upon the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> operatives involved. Subjective attitudes and external influences appear to have a significant impact upon the nature of the relationship. This evidence suggests that the partnership model in both New Zealand and Australia may be appropriately viewed as dynamic, with the relationship moulded more by the environment than by managerial design...|$|R

Hector eventually became so popular that he became associated with the whole <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> rather than just the self-assessment tax returns campaign.|$|R
