50|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{is another}} concern for livestock farmers. Environmental degradation often {{occurs when the}} resources are over-used. One major aspect of this degradation is the depletion of fresh water. Fresh water is needed by livestock to keep the animals in good health.

50|$|In the 19th century, grazing {{techniques}} were virtually non-existent. Pastures would be grazed {{for long periods}} of time, with no rest in between. This led to overgrazing and it was detrimental to the land, wildlife, and livestock producers.

Treatments comprised different leaf blade masses: 800, 1200, 1600 and 2000 kg of dry matter ha- 1. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four treatments and three repetitions, totaling 12 plots with 100 m 2 each. Results indicated increase in production, in the leaf/stem ratio and in the interval days according to increase in leaf blade mass. Daily accumulation rate was similar to treatments.

50|$|Human {{society of}} {{primitive}} communism {{is seen as}} organized in traditional tribe structures, typified by shared valuesand consumption of the entire social product. As no permanent surplus product is produced, {{there is also no}} possibility of a ruling class coming into existence. As this mode of production lacks differentiation into classes, it is said to be classless. Palaeolithic and Neolithic tools, pre- and early-agricultural production, and rigorous ritualized social control have often been said to be the typifying productive forces of this mode of <b>production.</b> However, the <b>foraging</b> mode of <b>production</b> still exists, and often typified in contemporary hunter-gatherer societies. Past theories of the <b>foraging</b> mode of <b>production</b> have focused on lack of control over food production. More recent scholarship has argued that hunter-gatherers use the <b>foraging</b> mode of <b>production</b> to maintain a specific set of social relations that, perhaps controversially, are said to emphasize egalitarianism and the collective appropriation of resources.|$|R

50|$|Silvopasture (Latin, silva forest) is the {{practice}} of combining forestry and grazing of domesticated animals in a mutually beneficial way. Advantages of a properly managed silvopasture operation are enhanced soil protection and increased long-term income due to the simultaneous production of trees and grazing animals.

40|$|Research at ILRI {{has shown}} the value of {{incorporating}} forages and fodder species into sustainable farming systems, {{but the lack of}} available seed of adapted forage materials remains a major constraint to their adoption by smallholder farmers. Technical knowledge, access to seed, and economic incentives are essential. Recognizing the need to promote access to forage seed, ILRI (formerly ILCA) established a Herbage Seed Unit in 1989 to address the problem in Sub Saharan Africa and enhance the incorporation of forages in feed resource Development. It was envisaged that this would be achieved by strengthening national capacities to produce forage seed, and training scientists and technicians. This activity has now been expanded to provide a source of tropical forage seed for the establishment of national <b>forage</b> seed <b>production</b> in many countries.

50|$|The use of {{chemical}} and mechanical control methods has been extensive, making it likely that shinnery oak's distribution is decreasing.
