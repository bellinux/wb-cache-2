25|$|Bing Crosby {{served as}} an honorary {{director}} of the festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E
500|$|In a 2013 interview, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that they partied heavily during {{the production of}} Follow the Leader, with massive amounts of alcohol, drugs, {{and women in the}} studio. Davis explained further, saying that while recording the vocals for [...] "It's On", there were [...] "people getting blowjobs right behind me, there was girls banging each other in front of me, people getting boned in the closet right behind me, it was the craziest shit I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life and I sang that song." [...] According to Davis, he only agreed to begin tracking vocals when producer Toby Wright met his demands for an eight-ball (a one-eighth ounce of cocaine).|$|E
500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing thing I have ever seen I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roettiers {{was widely}} {{credited}} {{as one of}} the best engravers ever employed at the English mint. John Evelyn termed him [...] "that excellent engraver... who emulates even the ancients in stone and metal" [...] (Diary, 20 July 1678), and Samuel Pepys declared his medals to be [...] "some of the finest pieces of work, in embossed work, that I <b>ever</b> did <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] (Diary, 26 March 1666).|$|R

500|$|... "Medusa" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because {{of the scope of}} the episode, a [...] "huge budget" [...] was allotted for the entry. Because the episode was written to take place in a subway system, a set meeting the requirements of the script had to be created. The eventual set was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway, a system that serves more than 700,000 people a day. According to star Robert Patrick, [...] "They got us in there, and we did it, and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage." [...] Patrick later described the set as [...] "the biggest damned thing I'd <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] In real life, the Boston subway system is [...] "fondly" [...] called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In [...] "Medusa", the [...] "T", was changed to an [...] "M" [...] "for fictional purposes".|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} sequence {{within the}} episode was the time-shift which ends in Tommy returning to 1918. Goddard {{noted that the}} time-shift [...] "essentially happened off-screen" [...] and that what the audience sees is [...] "great big wind machines and camera lights". Anthony Lewis described the wind machine used as [...] "the biggest wind machine I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life". [...] He comments that {{the intensity of the}} wind machine and the lighting enabled an [...] "instant-made reaction" [...] from himself and Mori. Goddard added that his first assistant director was [...] "instrumental in gearing up all the extras into a frenzy". The episode's soundtrack included the song [...] "One of These Mornings" [...] by Moby, which featured the vocals of Patti Labelle, from his 2002 album, 18. The track heard in the pub scene is [...] "She's Got You High" [...] from Mumm-Ra's 2007 debut album These Things Move in Threes.|$|E
500|$|To {{represent}} the ex-Borg colony on the planet, sets previously {{used for the}} episodes [...] "The Chute" [...] and [...] "" [...] from {{earlier in the season}} were used. This was further extended by the use of a computer generated matte painting created by freelancer Eric Chauvin. Borg sets from First Contact were not re-used, but instead a new set was built. This new set measured [...] in length curved around in a semi-circle, and McNeill was unsatisfied with this size. He said [...] "It was the smallest set that I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. We had no room on the stage to build a big Borg ship, because the other sets took up so much room." [...] He hoped that they had hidden this on camera, with it instead appearing as a series of separate corridors within the Borg vessel. McNeill explained that he had the actors walk the length of the set past the camera at the end, at which point a cut was made and they would go back {{to the start of the}} corridor to start filming again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} unbelieving," [...] Anna said coldly. [...] "I {{hope you will}} not compel me to say again that I {{do not know the}} man's name, nor, {{to the best of my}} belief, have I <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> him before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R

500|$|Coach Yost added: [...] "Schultz {{is without}} doubt the best {{center in the}} country. [...] In fact, Schulz is the best {{man in the middle}} of the line I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> {{football}} experience". [...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. [...] In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} game in Moscow, Henderson scored a goal to help Canada {{establish}} a 4–1 lead, but also suffered a concussion when he was tripped into the boards and knocked unconscious. He returned to finish the game, but the Soviets came back to win, 5–4, and were one victory shy of winning the series. In game six, Canada overcame what coach Harry Sinden called [...] "the worst officials I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] to win by a 3–2 score, with Henderson scoring the game-winning goal. [...] The game was also notable for Bobby Clarke using his stick in a two-handed slash that broke Valeri Kharlamov's ankle. [...] Henderson later called the event [...] "the low point of the series" [...] during the 30th anniversary celebration, but apologized for his comments after Clarke took umbrage. Canada drew even in the series at three wins apiece, plus one tie, with a 4–3 victory in game seven. [...] Henderson again scored the winner despite being tripped {{as he took the}} shot.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E
500|$|Pauline Kael {{said it was}} [...] "a monumentally unimaginative movie", and Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic {{called it}} [...] "a film that is so dull, it even dulls our {{interest}} in the technical ingenuity {{for the sake of}} which Kubrick has allowed it to become dull." [...] Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that it was [...] "somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring." [...] Variety's 'Robe' believed the film was a [...] "ig, beautiful, but plodding sci-fi epic... A major achievement in cinematography and special effects, 2001 lacks dramatic appeal to a large degree and only conveys suspense after the halfway mark." [...] Andrew Sarris called it [...] "one of the grimmest films I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life...2001 is a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points." [...] (Sarris reversed his opinion upon a second viewing of the film, and declared, [...] "2001 is indeed a major work by a major artist.") John Simon felt it was [...] "a regrettable failure, although not a total one. This film is fascinating when it concentrates on apes or machines... and dreadful when it deals with the in-betweens: humans...2001, for all its lively visual and mechanical spectacle, is a kind of space-Spartacus and, more pretentious still, a shaggy God story." [...] Eminent historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. deemed the film [...] "morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long... a film out of control". The BBC said that its slow pacing often alienates modern audiences more than it did upon its initial release.|$|E

"I {{was passing}} the 'ouse," [...] ses Bill Chambers, looking round at us, [...] "and I see an old man's {{face at the}} bedroom winder, and while I was {{wondering}} who 'e was a hand come and drawed 'im away. I see 'im as plain as <b>ever</b> I <b>see</b> anything <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, and the hand, too. Big and dirty it was." ...|$|R
25|$|The villa {{was sold}} in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, {{and for the past}} few years as a hotel. In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|R
5000|$|Craig {{reportedly}} invited RUC {{officers to}} an extravagant wedding reception held for his daughter. Author Sally Belfrage who encountered Craig at an [...] "Eleventh night" [...] party {{held at the}} UDA's east Belfast headquarters, summed him up as [...] "the most personally powerful man I had ever met, {{with an air of}} animal force that inspired awe at the idea of its ever being let loose. He was also as drunk as I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> anyone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life who could still more or less negotiate a sentence and a sequence of steps." [...] She claimed Craig had propositioned her; when she rebuffed his advances he took it in his stride, and grabbing a microphone, went on to lead the other revellers in a rendition of [...] "The Sash My Father Wore".|$|R
500|$|When {{he arrived}} with the Reds organization, Bates was {{assigned}} to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds of the AA. In a play-in game to determine the leader of the AA Eastern division, and thus the team that qualified for the playoffs, the Sounds played against the Buffalo Bisons. Nashville manager Pete Mackanin called the contest [...] "the most absurd game I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life": the match, which lasted 18 innings, ended when Chris Jones hit a double that scored Bates. Nashville played another extra-inning game, this time a 20-inning contest on September 7, against the Western-champion Omaha Royals in the playoffs and lost. Later, the Sounds lost the series three games to two; Bates' season, however, was not over, as the Reds added him to their MLB roster. In his Cincinnati debut on September 11, Bates came into the game as a pinch runner and scored on a Billy Doran hit. Dorana second baseman the Reds acquired from the Houston Astros in a [...] "last-minute" [...] deal before the trade deadlinewas hospitalized with back pain and spasms on September 29. Doctors performed an operation on October 3, which would hold him out of postseason play as Cincinnati won the National League West; the Reds were the first team in National League history to lead a division for an entire 162-game season. In a move that surprised Bates, who already prepared to return to his Houston residence after the Reds' last regular-season game, the club added him to their postseason roster.|$|E

They have great voices, but they are the ugliest band I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] Three members of the band (Lacey, Keighron and Garrett) were told they would not be part of the new group, and auditions were held in Dublin where Nicky Byrne and Brian McFadden were recruited.|$|E
2500|$|After Coco Crisp was injured, the Red Sox {{purchased}} Ellsbury's {{contract and}} {{he received a}} call-up on June 30, 2007, where he made his MLB debut in center field and hit ninth against the Texas Rangers at Fenway Park wearing number 46. He recorded his first major league hit, an infield single off of Robinson Tejeda, {{in the bottom of}} the third inning of that game. His first career stolen base came off pitcher Brandon McCarthy and catcher Gerald Laird of the Rangers on July 2. He also scored from second base in that game on a wild pitch. Johnny Pesky described the play as [...] "the greatest single play I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> years <b>in</b> baseball". He was optioned back to Pawtucket on July 5 after serving in six games for the Red Sox.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Tuson {{has made}} a {{specific}} point in interviews, that Diversi could offer a more affordable drawbar organ with a better sound engine alternative than Hammond Suzuki's [...] "New B3," [...] while being {{at a lower price}} and including a built-in Leslie speaker simulator. Though he once, like many organists, thought the Hammond and Leslie were inseparable, he now thinks the simulation on the Diversi is so good that [...] "I don't care if I <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> another Leslie <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life".|$|R

They set me close beside the stove insisting that I put <b>my</b> feet <b>in</b> the oven to dry, talking {{meanwhile}} of my cousins and the crops, and complaining of the incessant rainstorms which were succeeding one another almost without intermission, making this one of the wettest and most dismal autumns the country had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> Never <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> life has a roof seemed more heavenly, or hosts more sweet and gracious.|$|R
2500|$|In {{terms of}} pure keeping ability, Berry was rated {{extremely}} highly, particularly his ability [...] "keeping up" [...] both to leg-spinner Shane Warne and to medium (and even fast-medium) paced bowlers. Warne, his Victorian teammate, said that [...] "Darren Berry {{up to the}} stumps has probably been the best keeper that I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time... I really wish he did {{get the opportunity to}} show how good a keeper he was, with a baggy green cap playing for Australia." [...] Berry has often talked about his leg-side stumping off the bowling of paceman Paul Reiffel as one of his best achievements.|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, John Wayne told an {{interviewer}} that he considered High Noon [...] "the most un-American thing I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> whole life", and later teamed with director Howard Hawks to make Rio Bravo in response. [...] "I made Rio Bravo because I didn't like High Noon," [...] Hawks explained. [...] "Neither did Duke [...] I didn't think a good town marshal {{was going to run}} around town like a chicken with his head cut off asking everyone to help. And who saves him? His Quaker wife. That isn't my idea of a good Western." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of this {{controversy}} over whether Huckleberry Finn is racist or anti-racist, {{and because the}} word [...] "nigger" [...] is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time which has since become vulgar and taboo), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school system—this questioning of the word [...] "nigger" [...] is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the [...] "most grotesque example of racism I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life". According to the American Library Association, Huckleberry Finn was the fifth most frequently challenged book in the United States during the 1990s.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] demanded Mrs. Makely, as if {{this were}} a final stroke of logic. The young man did not reply, and Mrs. Makely continued: [...] "Now I will appeal to your sister to say whether she has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> any {{difference}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> manner toward her from what I show to all the young ladies in the hotel." [...] The young girl flushed and seemed reluctant to answer. [...] "Why, Lizzie!" [...] cried Mrs. Makely, and her tone showed that she was really hurt.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 and 1984, Cádiz {{traveled}} to the United States to play. The first year it was González who was the principal attraction, but in the following the team was joined by FC Barcelona and its superstar Diego Maradona, who later claimed that the Salvadoran was “without a doubt amongst the greatest ten players I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> play, <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> life”. His debut in the top division came on 11 September 1983 in a 1-3 home loss against the same opponent, Murcia, and the club was immediately relegated back.|$|R
60|$|A {{thousand}} {{feet or more}} above the level bench, {{the character of the}} forest changed; the pines grew thicker, and interspersed among them were silver spruces and balsams. Here in the clumps of small trees and underbrush, we began to jump deer, and in a few moments a greater number than I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> hunting experiences loped within range of my eye. I could not look out into the forest where an aisle or lane or glade stretched to any distance, without seeing a big gray deer cross it. Jones said the herds had recently come up from the breaks, where they had wintered. These deer were twice the size of the Eastern species, and as fat as well-fed cattle. They were almost as tame, too. A big herd ran out of one glade, leaving behind several curious does, which watched us intently for a moment, then bounded off with the stiff, springy bounce that so amused me.|$|R
2500|$|In the World Championship, Higgins {{defeated}} Stephen Lee 10–5 in {{the first}} round, Rory McLeod 13–7 {{in the second round}} and Ronnie O'Sullivan 13–10 in the quarter-finals. On the way to a 17–14 victory over Mark Williams in the semi-finals, Higgins was heckled by an audience member who shouted out, [...] "How do you swallow that three hundred thousand, John? ... You're a disgrace to snooker." [...] Higgins went on to defeat Judd Trump 18–15 in the final to win his fourth world title, which prompted Steve Davis to comment [...] "I think John Higgins is the best snooker player I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life". Despite the victory, Higgins lost the world number one ranking to Mark Williams.|$|E
2500|$|Penalties {{played a}} huge {{role in the}} game. [...] New England had 10 penalties, while the Raiders had 11. [...] "That {{was one of the}} worst-called games I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life," [...] said an angry Patriots DE Julius Adams. [...] "I just hope they were right", Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks said about the {{roughing}} the passer call against Ray Hamilton on Oakland's game-winning drive. [...] "It looked to me like Ray Hamilton hit the ball first. If he did deflect the ball, it was an incorrect call." [...] Later on, he added [...] "I’m proud of my team and the way we played today. We’re going home knowing we played our hearts out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson was {{originally}} approached {{to be involved}} in a live-action feature film adaptation of Thunderbirds as far back as 1996, but he was actually turned away by the producers of the 2004 film Thunderbirds, which was directed by Jonathan Frakes, after first being invited to meet with them. He distanced himself overtly from the project, later turning down an offer of $750,000 simply to write an endorsement of the film shortly before its release; Sylvia Anderson served as a consultant on the project and received a [...] "special thanks" [...] credit in the film. The film received poor critical reviews and was unsuccessful at the US box-office. Anderson disliked the film, describing it as [...] "the biggest load of crap I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life".|$|E

5000|$|His cire-perdue bronzes {{from this}} period are {{characterized}} by mythological themes, metamorphosis, death, the human condition and {{the mysteries of the}} cosmos. [...] "I've been asking myself insistently and for many years how it is to die. To leave one darkness in order to enter another semidarkness, the one that belongs to death. A lot of this is embodied <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sculptures and that's why this question upsets me profoundly. No one has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> this <b>in</b> <b>my</b> creations and it might not even be like this, but in this journey between the two darknesses I put all my effort". Often his figures are depicted with small heads, absent facial features, and gender ambiguities. The sensuality that characterized his earlier two-dimensional creations takes on new veneers in the textures and refined patinas of his bronzes, in which he also explores solidity and monumentality. Eduardo Serrano speaks of the creatures rendered in these bronzes as expectant and concerned for the future with “composed anxiety.” William Ospina in his literary and poetic essay, points the irony in Amaral's bronze sculptures from the 90s.|$|R
