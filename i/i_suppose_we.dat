All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do with}} us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{are often}} {{identified}} with the gothic rock genre, and are viewed {{as one of the}} form's definitive bands. Selecting the Best for One Side of a C90 |last=Doran |first=John |date=27 October 2008 |website=The Quietus}} However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006, [...] "It's so pitiful when 'goth' is still tagged onto the name the Cure", and added, [...] "We're not categorisable. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> were post-punk when we came out, but in total it's impossible [...] I just play Cure music, whatever that is." [...] Smith has also expressed his distaste for gothic rock, describing it as [...] "incredibly dull and monotonous. A dirge, really." [...] While typically viewed as producers of dark and gloomy music, the Cure have also yielded a number of upbeat songs and been part of the new wave movement. Spin has said [...] "the Cure have always been an either/or sort of band: either [...] Robert Smith is wallowing in gothic sadness or he's licking sticky-sweet cotton-candy pop off his lipstick-stained fingers." ...|$|E

This version included a 15-second sample of The Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love", as well as samples of the MC5's [...] "Kick Out the Jams" [...] and Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)". [...] The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, but copies of the white label were sent to DJs and the music press. [...] The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients (Drummond was actually something of a music business veteran, and Cauty {{a former member of}} the much-hyped but unsuccessful band Brilliant). Underground Magazine speculated on this in March 1987: [...] "The whole affair is mysterious, a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material... 'No, we've not been in bands before, and yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> were originally influenced by the Beastie Boys to actually get up and do something...'

500|$|The book {{generally}} received positive reception from literature critics. Publishers Weekly {{described it}} as [...] "golden SF from the Golden Age", and The Harvard Crimson called it [...] "one of the great classics" [...] of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly commented: [...] "Hubbard brilliantly evokes the vastness of space and the tragedy {{of those who would}} conquer it", and called the book [...] "one of his [...] finest works". Alan Cheuse reviewed the book in the San Francisco Chronicle, writing: [...] "As in a number of groundbreaking -- or time-breaking, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> ought to say -- works of science fiction, the science behind the story is more interesting than the fiction itself. Hubbard is a thinker who writes, rather than a writer who thinks, as most masters are." [...] Cheuse highlighted the book among his 2004 literature holiday picks in a piece for National Public Radio's program All Things Considered: [...] "Before he began founding new religions, Hubbard was one of the country's most prolific pulp science fiction writers, and this book is one of his best." [...] Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes [...] "besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time-dilation effects in long distance near-light-speed space travel, (To The Stars) is a pretty entertaining story." ...|$|E

She praised Neal Bledsoe's portrayal of Stephen Burkett, saying that he did a [...] "wonderful job of playing a chronic hair puller". She also praised the character of Curtis, stating that he was [...] "adorable". Of the storyline she said, [...] "The actual murder by electrocution was an interesting twist and one I didn't see coming. I was happy to see Bud jump in and read the murderer her rights before she said anything further. That certainly seemed like something a detective should do". She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played at the end of the episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment". Michelle Carlbert from TV Equals praised the scene in which Megan pulls Colin's hair, calling it one of her [...] "favourite bits", another being when it showed Ethan, Peter, Curtis and Bud going out on a [...] "Boy’s Night" [...] stating it was [...] "awesome" [...] and that she [...] "love(s) it when they show the team bonding like that". She also commented on Megan and Peter's clothes, stating that [...] "Megan looked great in her dress" [...] and Peter in a tux was [...] "whoa".|$|E

2500|$|With Lawry's {{defensive}} leadership {{under heavy}} fire he was dropped {{along with three}} other players, becoming the first Australian captain to be dropped {{in the middle of}} a series. He was not informed privately by the Board and only found out after his axing was made public. The Australian selectors Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> all have to get around to it some day". Two days earlier, after lengthy discussion, the ACB had voted 7–6 to acknowledge and respond to Lawry's letter following the South African tour, although their reply did not address Lawry's concerns. His successor Chappell condemned the Board's actions as [...] "unbelievable". Immediately after his appointment, the new leader told his wife [...] "The bastards won't get me the way they got Bill", and he later went out on his own terms. Victorian and Australian teammate Paul Sheahan said [...] "The fact that no-one had the courage to tell him he was to lose his job as Australian captain was disgraceful." [...] At the same time, Sheahan said that Lawry was [...] "a bit of an autocrat" [...] and [...] "not the sort of captain who stood alongside you and drew the best out of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fully {{aware that}} they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian {{selectors}} axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series. Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry {{at the end of the}} Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>we</b> all have to get around to it some day". Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column). This meant Australia's four man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since [...] in 1945–46 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed sacroiliac joint, which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test. This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australian had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.|$|E
