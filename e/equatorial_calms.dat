60|$|He {{studied the}} chart and sailing {{directions}} {{when he had}} nothing to do and was rather surprised that Wyndham did not. It was a long run to the Caribbean and would be longer if they drifted into the <b>equatorial</b> <b>calms.</b> Marston had a yacht master's certificate, although he was rather a seaman than a navigator. He could find his way along the coast by compass and patent-log, but to steer an ocean course was another thing. One must be exact when one calculated one's position by the height of the sun and stars.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Very good, Boy Jones," [...] I says, [...] "count 'em," [...] and I hauled him in {{over the}} gunnel, and ten I gave him with my large flat hand. The remarks he passed, lying face down tryin' to bite my leg, would have {{reflected}} credit on any Service. Having finished I dropped him overboard again, which was my gross political error. I ought to 'ave killed him; because he began signalling--rapid and accurate--in a sou'westerly direction. Few <b>equatorial</b> <b>calms</b> are to be apprehended when B.P.'s little pets take to signallin'. Make a note o' that! Three minutes later we were stopped and boarded by Scouts--up our backs, down our necks, and in our boots! The last I heard from your Mr. Leggatt as he went under, brushin' 'em off his cap, was thanking Heaven he'd covered up the new paint-work with mats. An 'eroic soul!' ...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka is a {{comparatively}} small island (65. 584 kmÂ²) within the <b>equatorial</b> belt of <b>calms.</b> There are only slight seasonal variations in temperature, air humidity and day length. A description is given of the amphibian and reptile material {{brought back from}} the Austrian Indo-Pacific expedition, 1970 - 71. Some notes on the habitat of the animals are included...|$|R
6000|$|During {{most part}} of the voyage out to China Mr Hazlit's visage had {{presented}} a sea-green aspect, edged with yellow. The great Demon of the sea had seized upon and held him with unwonted avidity and perseverance. It appeared to regard him as fair game--as one whose life had been largely devoted to ploughing up its peculiar domain--or rather, inducing others to plough there--and who was therefore worthy of special attention. At all events, the wealthy merchant did not appear above-board until the lapse of two weeks after leaving his native land. At {{the end of that}} period something like the ghost of him crawled on deck one rather fine day, but a demoniac squall rudely sent him below, where he remained until those charming regions of the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>calms</b> were entered. Here a bad likeness--a sort of spoiled photograph--of him again made its appearance, and lay down helplessly on a mattress, or smiled with pathetic sarcasm when food was offered. But soon the calm regions were passed; the Cape of Storms was doubled, and the fierce [...] "south-easters" [...] of the Indian seas were encountered, during which period Mr Hazlit passed away, as {{one of the things that}} had been, from the memory of all on board, with the exception of Aileen, the captain, the bed-room steward, and a Christian pastor, who, with his amiable wife, had done much during the voyage for their fellow-passengers.|$|E
