5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
5|$|Ono later bought 'Mendips' {{and donated}} it to The National Trust. It was renovated to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{as it was}} in the 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there.|$|E
5|$|The Wembley Stadium {{scene in}} the film 28 Weeks Later was {{actually}} filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The effects team on the film edited the footage to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more like Wembley.|$|E

50|$|About point 2, the smokestacks were {{arranged}} in a diamond shape, {{and in the middle}} the two smokestacks that are arranged parallel and the others in the front and back overlap so that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like there’s only one. When viewed from right beside <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like there’s only one. At a diagonal <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like there are two. From in between them, all four are visible, and from the direct front <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like there are three. Also, you could see the smokestacks very well from the Jōban Line or Keisei lines, and you could see the number of smokestacks change as the train moved down the tracks.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Twain's travelogue Following the Equator {{features}} Twain remarking on {{the viewing}} the Southern Cross {{for the first}} time, [...] "It is ingeniously named, for <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> just as a cross would <b>look</b> if <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> like something else." ...|$|R
5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques {{were applied to}} the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls {{had been}} added to the {{existing}} ruined walls {{on the east side of}} the castle to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site of the castle was excavated.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as big and threatening as possible.|$|E

It tracks around 250 million {{passenger}} movements per year. It has no defence against false passports. It operates the Pre-Departure Checks Scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Rotational {{symmetry}}, {{also known}} as radial symmetry in biology, is the property a shape has when <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object's degree of rotational symmetry {{is the number of}} distinct orientations in which <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> the same.|$|R

5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, {{as a source for}} lighting.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party {{best known for his}} restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> Indian.|$|E

We're as well acquainted with the crabs and stranded jelly-fish as we are with the children digging {{in the sand and}} the people sitting under umbrellas. I think they're always the same, all of them." ...|$|R

5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the truck}} Monk sees a broken Turkish figurine and remembers the vacuum bag was empty. He deduces that Teresa, while {{cleaning}} Merrigan's office, broke a figurine, which contained heroin. When Merrigan saw the broken figurine {{he realized that}} the vacuum bag was filled with heroin. When he found the drug on the vacuum bag, he killed Teresa. He spread the patient files and later he threw a rock at Dr. Kroger's house to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the killer was one of Dr. Kroger's patients.|$|E

5|$|Jaidev {{is forced}} {{to decide whether to}} retaliate or leave Kolkata completely. He chooses to leave out of loyalty to Bhagavan and heads to Palasa, the village of Sandhya where Sandhya's brother Ashok (Subbaraju) is a valiant and kind-hearted cop. He comes across S. I. Paparayudu (Brahmanandam), and he solves the {{problems}} of the village by cleverly using Paparayudu. Jaidev cannot hide the truth from Sandhya anymore. Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he made <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like that Paparayudu solved the problems of village. Since Jaidev told the truth, Sandhya still loves him.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{like many of the}} exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E
5000|$|The joint {{between the}} index {{metacarpal}} and the capitate is a fibrous non-mobile joint.

60|$|It is evening now. The snow {{is still}} on the ground; but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> ruddy and warm in the streets, because of the blaze of light from the shop-windows, and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> colder than <b>it</b> did on the house-tops, by reason of the moon which sails in the wintry sky.|$|R

5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
