When Σ=Σ(A) is a shift of finite type and A is an irreducible N× N non-negative matrix, the measure μ is the Parry measure. μ is ergodic with maximum entropy. The result holds for sofic shift G=(G,L), which is irreducible. The result can be extended to Σ(A), where A is a countably infinite matrix that is irreducible, aperiodic and positive recurrent.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{critical}} reappraisal {{of the available}} results on the broken phase of λ(Φ 4) 4 theory, as obtained from rigorous formal analyses and from lattice calculations.

As recently pointed out, this implies that the simple one-loop effective potential should become effectively exact.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} structure and topological properties of cyclically presented groups. First, a family of groups called groups of type Z is considered. With few exceptions, the finiteness, asphericity, fixed point, and 3 -manifold spine problems are solved. Most groups of type Z have a central element of infinite order fixed by the shift. Moreover, the shift extension decomposes as an amalgamated product, with factor a centrally extended triangle group. Consequently, most groups of type Z are SQ-universal. Heegaard diagrams are constructed to produce a class of Seifert fibered 3 -manifolds; each is a cyclic branched cover of a lens space. Generalizing those in [16], this class includes the Brieskorn [50] and Sieradski manifolds [64]. The shift dynamics of the groups Gn(k,m) = Gn(x 0 xmxk^- 1) of Fibonacci type [40] are investigated. These generalize the Fibonacci groups F(2, n) = Gn(1, 2) [20], Sieradski groups S(2, n) = Gn(2, 1) [64], and Gilbert- Howie groups H(n,m) = Gn(m; 1) [28]. Modulo two unresolved cases, the asphericity problem for groups of Fibonacci type was solved in [71]; finiteness [72]; 3 -manifold group [37]. Here the main finding is the shift action is faithful for all n; m; k such that Gn(m; k) is nontrivial. The fixed point and freeness problems are also solved, except {{for a handful of}} groups including H(9; 4) and H(9; 7). The first known examples of infinite, non-aspherical groups with <b>free</b> <b>shift</b> action are discovered. Finally, the situation is considered when a word w 2 F(x 0, [...] .,xn- 1) in a cyclic presentation Pn(w) is composite, i. e. w = v u. We find the structure of Gn(v o u) depends on Gn(u) and Gn(v), with respect to the finiteness, asphericity, shift dynamics, and 3 -manifold spine problems. The idea of studying Gn(v o u) via Gn(v) is introduced in [3], and arose in classifying finiteness and shift dynamics [4]. The earliest example of composite words we are aware of is [56], and [11] is the first of several papers ([55], [31]) that discuss composing balanced presentations of the trivial group {{as it relates to the}} Andrews- Curtis conjecture. Only [31] specifically considers cyclically presented groups, and they show that if Gn(u) = Gn(v) = 1, then Gn(v o u) = 1. This follows immediately from our results...|$|E
