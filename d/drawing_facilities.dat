The junior boys in particular were the ones who always venturesome in trapping bulbuls.

The graph drawing primitives support {{a variety of different}} node shapes, edge connection points, and edges. Both nodes and edges can be labeled.

The starting point of the SVG extension is a library that provides an exact of mirror of SVG 1. 1 in the functional programming language Scheme. Each element of SVG 1. 1 is represented as a specific function in Scheme. The graph drawing primitives are implemented as functional abstractions on top of the SVG 1. 1 mirror functions.

40|$|The Metabolic Interactive Simulation Tool, MIST, is a {{software}} package, running under Microsoft Windows 3. 1, {{which can be}} used for dynamic simulations, stoichiometric calculations and control analysis of metabolic pathways. The pathways can be of any complexity and are defined by the user in a simple, interactive way. The user-defined enzymatic rate equations can be compiled either by an external or an internal compiler. Simulations of pathways compiled by an external compiler run significantly faster, but since these compilers are commercial software, they are not distributed together with MIST. The simulations are performed by numerical integration of a set of ordinary differential equations. The integration can be done by either an explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm or a semiimplicit third-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, both with adjustable step size. The second algorithm can be used if the set of differential equations is stiff Vector-based <b>drawing</b> <b>facilities</b> are included in the program, with which results can be presented in graphs.

40|$|Abstract –The European Union’s common {{agricultural}} policy (CAP) was changed in 2003; the area-based subsidy was changed to a single payment scheme. As part of this reform a control of cross compliance of the applications for subsidy was introduced concerning at least 1 % of all the applications for area-based subsidy. The European Union found that remote sensing was an efficient tool to perform part of {{the control of the}} cross compliance issues. In ten years the European Union has set up the yearly technical specification and recommendations for the controls with remote sensing. This control is now acting as the primarily control of the applications for subsidy in most of the member states, which shows one of the largest benefits from the remote sensing data. With the recent change in the CAP the scope of the remote sensing images will be extended to the environmental issues which is subject for the cross compliance. The yearly technical specifications and recommendations are taking this new control in to consideration. The Remote Sensing Unit at DIAS has since 1992 performed a part of the control of the area based subsidies by remote sensing. As part of the controls implementation of a national register of parcels and a digital field block map was required. The farmers apply either using orthophoto paper maps or using the <b>drawing</b> <b>facilities</b> on the Internet to draw the outlines of their fields within the field blocks. The Internet application allows also the farmer to draw the outlines of their parcels more precise using the zooming facility. The paper maps are fixed at scale 1 : 10000.

40|$|Heavy metal {{fluoride}} glasses {{are used in}} such applications as fiber lasers and laser amplifiers. ZrF 4 -BaF 2 -LaF 3 -AlF 3 -NaF (ZBLAN) {{is one of the}} more commonly used heavy metal {{fluoride glasses}}. ZBLAN is an infrared transmitter and has a theoretical attenuation coefficient of 0. 002 db/km. However, due to impurities and small crystallites this attenuation coefficient has not been achieved to date. ZBLAN is a fragile glass which can lead to rapid crystallization, if the glass is not cooled rapidly to below the glass transition temperature or if the glass is reheated near the crystallization temperature for any period of time. Studies carried on at Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of Alabama in Huntsville since 1993 have shown that heating ZBLAN glass at the crystallization temperature in reduced gravity results in a suppression of crystallization when compared to ZBLAN processed in unit gravity. These studies utilized NASA's KC- 135 aircraft and the Conquest sounding rocket. In the first series of experiments, short lengths of ZBLAN fiber were heated to the crystallization temperature in reduced gravity on board the KC- 135 and the Conquest sounding rocket and compared with fibers heated in unit gravity. The fibers processed in reduced gravity showed no evidence of crystallization when studied with x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. However, the fibers processed in unit gravity were completely crystallized. Subsequent experiments included heating small pieces of ZBLAN glass at the crystallization temperature while viewing with a video camera to follow the crystallization phenomenon. In this experiment crystallization was observed in reduced gravity, however, it was suppressed when compared to heating in unit gravity. In the most recent experiment on board the KC- 135, rapid thermal analysis of ZBLAN was performed. A mechanism to explain the observations has been proposed. This mechanism is based on shear thinning whereby, the glass undergoes a reduction in viscosity in the 10 (exp 5) - 10 (exp 7) poise range, allowing more rapid diffusion and thus crystallization. It is proposed that this mechanism is suppressed in reduced gravity. An experiment is presently being conducted to test this theory. With increased knowledge of ZBLAN behavior in reduced gravity, three low earth orbit tiber <b>drawing</b> <b>facilities</b> have been designed. One would be suitable for use on the International Space Station, another while aboard the Space Shuttle and the third system is a fully automated facility which would operate independently of the ISS or Shuttle in a free float mode.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the importance of sketching in design cognition, particularly {{in the early stages}} of engineering design. The goal of this preliminary study is to consider the role of a designer's sketching ability and to examine the potential link between sketching skill and measures of engineering design performance. Sketching ability was evaluated on three distinct aspects relevant to engineering design: visual recall, rendering, and novel visualization. These evaluations were correlated with each other and with measures for sketch fluency, reviewer ranking, and design project outcome. The results of this study suggest that sketching skill is not comprehensive nor is it solely task based. Rather, a designer's sketching ability lies between these two poles. Positive correlations were found between the quantity of sketches produced and two of the sketching skills that emphasize <b>drawing</b> <b>facility,</b> but a negative correlation was found between sketch quantity and a skill related to mechanism visualization. No conclusive correlations were found between the sketching skills and design outcome and reviewer ranking. This study's findings suggest an important interplay between a designer's ability to sketch and their ability to visualize in their heads or through prototypes. Results also suggest that designers who are given sketch instruction tended to draw more overall...|$|R
