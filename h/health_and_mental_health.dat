Most of the studies on forgiveness cannot isolate it as an independent variable in an individual's well-being, so it is difficult to prove causation.|$|E

Love participated with Linda Perry for the event again in 2012, and performed alongside Aimee Mann and comedian Wanda Sykes. Speaking on her collaboration on the event, Love said: [...] "Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year {{go out on the}} street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They come out to their parents, and become homeless... for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations—I've played many of them—but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{no studies}} of {{adequate}} scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts work {{to change a}} person's sexual orientation. Those efforts have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by LGBT rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations and other faith-based organizations, on the other. The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and therefore not a mental disorder. The American Psychological Association says that [...] "most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation".|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that bans must include {{exceptions}} for {{threats to the}} woman's life, physical <b>health,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow. [...] Note that just because {{a portion of a}} state's law is found to be unconstitutional {{does not mean that the}} entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: [...] "nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief," [...] meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).|$|E

The American Psychological Association, on the other hand, considers positions of NARTH unscientific, and the Canadian Psychological Association has expressed concern that [...] "some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values." [...] Views held by the American College of Pediatricians are also contrary to views of American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical and child welfare authorities which take the view that sexual orientation has no correlation with the ability to be a good parent and raise healthy and well-adjusted children.|$|E

METHODS: Fifty-five ELBW adults, 18 men (33 %), with median (range) gestational age of 28. 7 (25. 0 - 34. 0) weeks and birth weight of 930 (680 - 990) grams, born in Switzerland, were included. They self-rated their <b>health</b> status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> at a mean (range) age of 23. 3 (21. 8 - 25. 9) years. Health status {{was measured by}} the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form- 36 questionnaire <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> by the Brief Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: The mean scores for both outcome measures were in the normal range. However, the study group self-rated significantly higher physical <b>health</b> status <b>and</b> lower <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status compared with the community norms, <b>and</b> scores for self-perceived <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> tended to be worse in the former. ELBW adults reported more problems in socio-emotional role functioning compared with the community norms. Female sex was associated with poorer and bronchopulmonary dysplasia with better <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status. CONCLUSION: <b>Health</b> status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of former ELBW adults were overall satisfying. However, the comparison with the community norms revealed differences, which may be important for parental and patient counselling and developing support strategies...|$|R
