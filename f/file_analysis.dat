40|$|Part 4 : FILESYSTEM FORENSICSInternational audienceThe {{first step}} when {{recovering}} deleted files using file carving {{is to identify}} the file type of a block, also called <b>file</b> fragment <b>analysis.</b> Several researchers have demonstrated the applicability of Kolmogorov complexity methods such as the normalized compression distance (NCD) to this problem. NCD methods compare the results of compressing a pair of data blocks with the compressed concatenation of the pair. One parameter that is required is the compression algorithm to be used. Prior research has identified the NCD compressor properties that yield good performance. However, no {{studies have focused on}} its applicability to <b>file</b> fragment <b>analysis.</b> This paper describes the results of experiments on a large corpus of files and file types with different block lengths. The experimental results demonstrate that, in the case of <b>file</b> fragment <b>analysis,</b> compressors with the desired properties do not perform statistically better than compressors with less computational complexity...|$|R

When used together with “app enablers” like DNAApp (Nguyen et al. 2014) which analyzes ab 1 files, DNA 2 App can provide additional off-line analysis of sequencing data. While sharing certain similar features to our DNAApp, DNA 2 App was highly requested as it allows text input, and has added features (such as restriction enzymes, reverse translation) compared to only ab 1 <b>files</b> <b>analysis</b> in DNAapp. Thus it serves as an independent app and also a complementary add-on for mobile analysis.|$|R
