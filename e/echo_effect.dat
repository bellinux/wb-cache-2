25|$|Delay is {{an audio}} effect and an effects unit which records an input signal to an audio storage medium, and then plays it {{back after a}} period of time. The delayed signal may either be played back {{multiple}} times, or played back into the recording again, to create the sound of a repeating, decaying echo. Delay effects range from a subtle <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> to a pronounced blending of previous sounds with new sounds. Delay effects can be created using tape loops, an approach developed in the 1940s and 1950s; analog effects units, which were introduced in the 1970s; digital effects pedals, introduced in 1984; and audio software plugins, developed in the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|For {{the scenes}} {{involving}} Mary and Jessica's deaths {{at the hands}} of the demon Azazel, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a [...] "really nasty" [...] sounding <b>echo</b> <b>effect.</b> He would later reuse this theme in the season one episode [...] "Nightmare". The episode also included a number of rock songs, which would become a tradition for the series. Kripke wanted to feature the song [...] "Enter Sandman", but Metallica would not grant permission.|$|E
500|$|Another {{hallmark}} of Achebe's style {{is the use}} of proverbs, which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He sprinkles them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in Arrow of God [...] "serves to create through an <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> the judgement of a community upon an individual violation." [...] The use of such repetition in Achebe's urban novels, No Longer at Ease and A Man of the People, is less pronounced.|$|E

5000|$|Wrights Hill is {{frequently}} used by TV and feature filmmakers. The Fellowship of the Ring sound designers used the tunnels to record <b>echo</b> <b>effects</b> for the Mines of Moria sequence.|$|R
500|$|The theme, [...] "The X-Files", {{used more}} {{instrumental}} sections than most dramas. The theme song's famous whistle effect {{was inspired by}} the track [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] from The Smiths' 1985 album Meat Is Murder. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rack-mount synth with an effect called [...] "Whistling Joe". After hearing this effect, Carter was [...] "taken aback" [...] and noted it was [...] "going to be good". According to the [...] "Behind the Truth" [...] segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter {{walked out of the room}} and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter; Snow said, [...] "this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it." [...] The second episode, [...] "Deep Throat", marked Snow's debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in [...] "Deep Throat".|$|E
500|$|In {{both the}} Italian and French version Orfeo's lyre is {{represented}} by the harp, and it was this use of the instrument in 1774 that it is usually thought introduced the harp to French orchestras. Each verse of the strophic [...] "Chiamo il mio ben cosi" [...] is accompanied by different solo instruments. In Vienna these were flute, horns, and English horns, but in 1774 Gluck was required to change this orchestration to that of a single horn and two clarinets, again replacing uncommon instruments with those in far more widespread usage. During the aria [...] "Chiamo il mio ben cosi" [...] and the interspersing recitatives Gluck added another offstage orchestra consisting of strings and chalumeaux, in order to provide an <b>echo</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
500|$|Waters {{experimented with}} the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 {{synthesisers}} on Pink Floyd pieces such as [...] "On the Run", [...] "Welcome to the Machine", and [...] "In the Flesh?" [...] He played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, Ovation and Washburn guitars. He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song [...] "Sheep", from Animals, and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as [...] "Pigs on the Wing 1&2", also from Animals, [...] "Southampton Dock" [...] from The Final Cut, and on [...] "Mother" [...] from The Wall. A Binson Echorec 2 <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> was used on his bass-guitar lead track [...] "One of These Days". Waters plays trumpet during concert performances of [...] "Outside the Wall".|$|E
50|$|This was {{recorded}} when Micky was helping engineer Hank Cicalo with studio <b>echo</b> <b>effects.</b> Micky also plays on a zither {{that can be}} heard on {{the opening of the}} original album.|$|R
50|$|The Polychorus allows highly {{adjustable}} chorus, flanger, filter matrix, and slapback <b>echo</b> <b>effects.</b> Notable users include Cobain (i.e. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter), Adrian Belew, {{and more}} recently Ryan Jarman of The Cribs.|$|R
50|$|Arthur Klemt (born 1913 in Offenburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany — died 1985 in Olching, Bavaria, Germany) was a German inventor. He {{invented the}} Echolette NG51 tape <b>echo</b> <b>effects</b> unit notably used by Chuck Berry and The Beatles.|$|R
500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is 3 minutes 25 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of C major. The track begins with just a guitar, {{featuring}} an <b>echo</b> <b>effect,</b> playing the descending notes C, B, A, G, F, E, D and G before the band join on 13 seconds with the bridge during which Gruff Rhys sings the word [...] "why" [...] several times in a falsetto voice, accompanied by strings arranged by Sonia Slay and the group. The first verse follows on 38 seconds with Rhys accompanied by a basic 4/4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan, sparse bass guitar and a melody line played by Huw Bunford on guitar. The first chorus enters at 1 minute 4 seconds with Rhys singing the words [...] "as our hair turns white, all the stars still shine so bright above, at least it's {{not the end of the}} world" [...] while Bunford plays a guitar counter-melody. Another bridge and verse follow before the second chorus appears at 2 minutes 2 seconds with Rhys this time singing [...] "as our hair turns grey everything is far from A-A-A-ok". The outro begins at 2 minute 23 seconds, with the chorus repeating before the bridge plays through several times, ending on a C chord.|$|E
500|$|However, {{recurring}} characters {{often have}} certain musical themes attached to them. For the pilot episode, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations {{to create a}} [...] "really nasty"-sounding <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> for the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths {{at the hands of}} the demon Azazel. Lennertz returns to this in [...] "Nightmare", including it when Sam realizes the connection he shares with the demon and Max. The episode [...] "Dead in the Water" [...] was the first to use what Kripke feels is the [...] "Winchester emotion", which involves sorrowful and reverberating piano notes on top of strings. It plays when the brothers make connections with other characters. As well, there are variants of a guitar line used as the [...] "humorous brothers' theme" [...] in many episodes, including [...] "Pilot" [...] and [...] "Hell House", when the brothers are having fun. With Gruska writing Meg Masters' theme for [...] "Scarecrow", Lennertz reused the music in [...] "Shadow" [...] but [...] "took the scary up a notch" [...] to imply to the viewers that she is both [...] "more important and more devilish" [...] than the other creatures in the episode. For the penultimate episode [...] "Salvation", Lennertz incorporated musical elements used throughout the season.|$|E
500|$|During the February 3, 1967, {{session at}} Olympic, the Experience {{improved}} the January 11 master tape of [...] "Purple Haze" [...] by re-recording the vocal and lead guitar parts, and adding another Octavia guitar overdub, which was sped-up and panned {{at the end}} of the song. The group reconvened at Olympic on February 7, continuing their work on [...] "Purple Haze" [...] by recording Hendrix's rhythm guitar and vocal parts, as well as Redding's background vocals. They spent time overdubbing ambient background sounds by playing tapes through a set of headphones that were held near a microphone, creating an <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> as the headphones were moved closer; they completed a final mix of [...] "Purple Haze" [...] the following day. During the session, they worked on the De Lane Lea master tape of [...] "Fire", replacing everything except Redding's bass line, which he double-tracked in an effort to accentuate the recording's lower frequencies. Kramer placed the second bass line on a dedicated track and blended Redding's original bass line with Mitchell's newly recorded drum part. They also recorded Mitchell and Redding's backing vocals. [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] was also reworked on February 8; Redding recorded a new bass line and Hendrix and Mitchell added overdubs to their existing parts. After recording backing vocals by Redding and lead vocals from Hendrix, Kramer prepared the song's final mix.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{original}} four-track mix before the song was transferred to eight-track tape for further overdubs; the four-track mix lacks the released mix's extensive <b>echo</b> <b>effects</b> and also features alternate organ parts, particularly on the ending.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm Not the One" [...] was remixed {{upon its}} {{inclusion}} on their Greatest Hits album of 1985, with special {{attention paid to}} the electronic percussion and <b>echo</b> <b>effects.</b> The song also appears in the 1995 film Billy Madison.|$|R
5000|$|A remix of [...] "The Crown Of Sympathy" [...] was {{featured}} on the band's third single, [...] "I Am the Bloody Earth". This version of the song featured more <b>echoing</b> <b>effects,</b> a shorter outro and a heavy emphasis on Rick Miah's drum sound.|$|R
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E

2500|$|Welles did {{not speak}} the {{signature}} line, [...] "Who knows what evil lurks {{in the hearts of}} men?" [...] Instead, Readick did, using a water glass next to his mouth for the <b>echo</b> <b>effect.</b> The famous catch phrase was accompanied by the strains of an excerpt from Opus 31 of the Camille Saint-Saëns classical composition, Le Rouet d'Omphale.|$|E
5000|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{thought that}} the song had better {{production}} than the others on the album, saying, [...] "With the <b>echo</b> <b>effects</b> on the vocal and the big strings at the same volume as those ringing, jangling guitars, musicians can't miss." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instrumentation}} on the Roxy Music recording {{is dominated}} by Ferry's Hohner Pianet N electric piano and features an Andy MacKay sax solo—based on the melody of [...] "As Time Goes By", a song featured prominently in Casablanca—that is treated with tape <b>echo</b> <b>effects</b> by Brian Eno.|$|R
50|$|Many real-life {{communities}} are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The <b>echo</b> chamber <b>effect</b> may prevent individuals from noticing changes {{in language and}} culture involving groups other than their own. Regardless, the <b>echo</b> chamber <b>effect</b> reinforces one's own present world view, making it seem more correct and more universally accepted than it really is. Another emerging term for this <b>echoing</b> and homogenizing <b>effect</b> on the Internet within social communities is cultural tribalism.|$|R
2500|$|In Memphis Sam Phillips used various {{techniques}} to create similar acoustics at his Memphis Recording Services Studio. The {{shape of the}} ceiling, corrugated tiles, and the setup of the studio were augmented by [...] "slap-back" [...] tape echo which involved feeding the original signal from one tape machine through a second machine. The <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> had been used, less subtly, on Wilf Carter Victor records of the 1930s, and in Eddy Arnold's 1945 [...] "Cattle Call".|$|E
2500|$|Page {{employed}} a [...] "backward echo" [...] studio sound processing effect on Plant's vocals and the guitar {{towards the end}} of the song. This involves manipulating a recorded echo so it precedes the main sound instead of following it. Page developed the method in 1967 when recording the single [...] "Ten Little Indians" [...] with the Yardbirds. [...] In an interview with Guitar Magazine in 1993, Page recalled how the backwards <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> came together on this song: ...|$|E
2500|$|The spin <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> was {{discovered}} by Erwin Hahn when he applied two successive 90° pulses separated by short time period, but detected a signal, the echo, when no pulse was applied. [...] This phenomenon of spin echo was explained by Erwin Hahn in his 1950 paper, and further developed by Carr and Purcell who pointed out the advantages of using a 180° refocusing pulse for the second pulse. The pulse sequence may be better understood by breaking it down into the following steps: ...|$|E
25|$|From its inception, {{the style}} has been {{characterized}} by hard danceable electronic beats, clear undistorted or slightly electronically distorted vocals, shouts or growls with reverberation and <b>echo</b> <b>effects,</b> and repetitive sequencer lines. At the time the genre arose, important synthesizers were the Korg MS-20, Emulator II, Oberheim Matrix and Yamaha DX7.|$|R
50|$|When a {{returning}} reflection strikes another discontinuity, some of {{the signal}} rebounds in the original signal direction, creating multiple <b>echo</b> <b>effects.</b> These forward <b>echoes</b> strike the receiver at different intervals {{making it difficult for}} the receiver to accurately detect data values on the signal. The effects can resemble those of jitter.|$|R
50|$|Live on stage, The Honeymoon Killers {{often used}} {{pre-recorded}} drum machine loops which were played from cassette, over this they put guitar, bass, drums, trashy percussion, cheap-sounding organ, with Vromman and Vincent taking turns on singing. Some of their songs were extended to 20 minutes {{with their own}} brand of dub <b>echo</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Before the {{invention}} of audio delay technology, music employing a delayed echo had to be recorded in a naturally reverberant space, often an inconvenience for musicians and engineers. The popularity of an easy-to-implement real-time <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> led {{to the production of}} systems offering an all-in-one effects unit that could be adjusted to produce echoes of any interval or amplitude. The presence of multiple [...] "taps" [...] (playback heads) made it possible to have delays at varying rhythmic intervals; this allowed musicians an additional means of expression over natural periodic echoes.|$|E
2500|$|Jones also {{occasionally}} {{played an}} Olympic White Fender Stratocaster (for live versions of [...] "Straight to Hell") and several Bond Electraglide Guitars that were donated {{to him by}} Andrew Bond, who made the guitars. For effects Jones mainly uses MXR pedals including a Phase 100, a flanger, an analog delay and a noise gate {{as well as a}} Roland chorus or Space <b>Echo</b> <b>effect.</b> During his days with the Clash, Jones used a Marshall Plexi amplifier and occasionally a Fender Twin with a 2x12 cabinet. He later changed to a Mesa Boogie amplifier with two Marshall 4x12 cabinets that he used throughout the rest of his career with the Clash.|$|E
2500|$|The {{population}} in Co. Meath has been characterised since 1861 {{as being in}} a period of significant decline. Between 1861 and 1901 the population [...] almost halved (110,373 to 67,497); the population stabilised from 1901 to 1971 (67,497 to 71,729) and there was a substantial increase between 1971 and 1981 to 95,419. This increase was mainly due to a baby boom locally. The population continued to increase at a constant rate, before increasing at an explosive rate between 1996 and 2002, from 109,732 to 134,005. This is due primarily to economic factors, with the return of residents to live in the county, and also an <b>echo</b> <b>effect</b> of the 1970s baby boom. The census of 2011 gives a statistic of 184,135 to include a dramatic increase in inward migration in the county, much of it from neighbouring Dublin and Drogheda.|$|E
5000|$|Anu re-recorded {{the song}} for her second album Come My Way in 2001, subtitled [...] "Earth Beat", which removed the <b>echoed</b> <b>effects</b> during the choruses, but added subtle synth effects and more {{prominent}} guitar during the song, making it sound more rhythmic and polished, whereas the original was driven more with a drum beat.|$|R
50|$|Tracks 3, 4, and 5 are continuations of each other, {{fading out}} at the end of track 5. Tracks 6 through 21 are continuations as well. Track 22 is silent, except for the {{beginning}} which is an extension from track 21. Track 23 features John Balance laughing with <b>echo</b> <b>effects</b> applied to his voice.|$|R
