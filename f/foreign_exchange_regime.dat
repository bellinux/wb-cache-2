50|$|The {{flight from}} {{domestic}} money {{depends on a}} country's institutional factors. The first factor {{is the level of}} development of the domestic financial market. An economy with a well-developed financial market can offer a set of alternative financial instruments denominated in domestic currency, reducing the role of foreign currency as an inflation hedge. The pattern of the currency substitution process also varies across countries with different foreign exchange and capital controls. In a country with strict foreign exchange regulations, the demand for foreign currency will be satisfied in the holding of foreign currency assets abroad and outside the domestic banking system. This demand often puts pressure on the parallel market of foreign currency and on the country's international reserves. Evidence for this pattern is given in the absence of currency substitution during the pre-reform period in most transition economies, because of constricted controls on foreign exchange and the banking system. In contrary, by facilitating the domestic holding of foreign currency, a country might mitigate the shift of assets abroad and strengthen its external reserves in exchange for a currency substitution process. However, the effect of this regulation on the pattern of currency substitution depends on the public's expectations of macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From 1996 {{until the}} spring of 2003, the {{official}} and so-called [...] "commercial" [...] exchange rate - both set administratively by the Central Bank - were highly overvalued. Many businesses and individuals were unable to buy dollars legally at these [...] "low" [...] rates, so a widespread black market developed to meet hard currency demand. The spread between the official exchange rate and the curb rate widened especially after the Russian financial crisis of August 1998: {{at the end of}} 1999 the curb rate stood at 550 som/US$ compared with the official rate of 140 som/US$, a gap by nearly a factor of 4 (up from a factor of [...] "only" [...] 2 in 1997 and the first half of 1998). By mid-2003, the government's stabilization and liberalization efforts had reduced the gap between the black market, official, and commercial rates to approximately 8% and it quickly disappeared as the som was made convertible after October 2003. Today, four foreign currencies—the U.S. dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen—are freely exchanged in commercial booths all around the cities, while other currencies, including the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge, are bought and sold by individual ("black market") money changers, who are allowed to operate openly without harassment. The <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>regime</b> since October 2003 is characterized as [...] "controlled floating rate". Liberalization of the trade regime remains a prerequisite for Uzbekistan to proceed to an IMF-financed program.

40|$|Recently, with {{increasing}} volatility of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, risk management {{becomes more and}} more important not only for multinational companies and individuals but also for central governments. This paper attempts to build an econometrics model so as to forecast and manage risks in <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market, especially during the eve of turbulent periods. By following McNeil and Frey’s (2000) two stage approach called conditional EVT to estimate dynamic VaR commonly used in stock and insurance markets, we extend it by applying a more general asymmetric ARMA-GARCH model to analyze daily <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> dollar-denominated trading data from four countries of different development levels across Asia and Europe for a period of more than 10 years from January 03, 2005 to May 29, 2015, which is certainly representative of global markets.

Inspiringly, test results show that by taking several specific characteristics (including fat-tails, asymmetry and long-range dependence) of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market return data into consideration, the violation ratio of out-of-sample data can be forecasted very well for both fixed and flexible <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>regimes.</b> Moreover, all of the violations are evenly distributed along the whole period which indicates another favorable property of our model.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the onset of financial crises by solving for the optimal trading strategies of speculators in financial markets, in a model where each speculator tries to coordinate her trades with the market''s by observing the decisions of other speculators, while simultaneously trying to preempt the market. The interaction and resolution of these two conflicting incentives are analyzed under alternate central bank policy regimes. Our model explains how imperfect information structures prevent traders from exploiting profitable opportunities and suggests how large traders help alleviate this problem by undertaking risky arbitrage early in the investment process, in return for higher profits, if successful. The central bank''s defense strategy is a parameter of this model. We compare {{the likelihood of a}} crisis under alternate defense strategies and show that credible monetary authorities can provide a better defense of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes</b> against adverse shocks by not disclosing their commitment value to the market.
