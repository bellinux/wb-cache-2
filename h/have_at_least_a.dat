25|$|However, {{in spite}} {{of more than a}} century of formal {{separation}} of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist Inari shrines. During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, shrine-temples (jingū-ji) were destroyed while temple-shrines (chinjusha) were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is Seiganto-ji), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> small one.|$|E

The source also reveals that knowledge varies greatly within the territory, with knowledge in the Province of Alicante being consistently lower than in Castellón and Valencia.|$|E

The risk factors for heart disease included dyslipidemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking. The risk of heart disease is estimated using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort equation.

Services cannot properly be conducted by a single person, but must have at least one other person present (i.e. a Priest cannot celebrate alone, but must <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> Chanter present and participating).|$|E

Limestone deposits mainly exist on the coast, whereas the interior mountain ranges are primarily igneous and do not harbor these snails. The ranges of most species appear to be quite small; some probably occur along bluffs of ca. 20km or less. Fortunately, some species <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> portion of their range in protected areas such as Parque Nacional Del Este, Parque Nacional Isabel De Torres, and Parque Nacional El Choco. Despite their narrow ranges, individuals are often locally abundant.|$|E

Why not just agree that we all <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of {{inconsistencies}} of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such rituals {{could be construed as}} prayers rather than spells. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the Munich Manual is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It has been suggested that the authors of the Manual knowingly designed the book to be in discord with ecclesiastical law. The main recipe employed throughout the Manual used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from apocryphal texts and the Hebrew Torah required that the author of such rites <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> casual familiarity with these sources.|$|E
