His father had come from Australia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California. He went to work in a printing-office,--I have heard him tell of it many times,--and he got three dollars a week, at first.

60|$|To {{say that}} the United States was stunned is but to expose the {{inadequacy}} of language. The whole world was stunned. It confronted that blight of the human brain, the unprecedented. Human endeavour was a jest, a monstrous futility, when a lunatic on a lonely island, who owned a yacht and an exposed village, could destroy five of the proudest fleets of Christendom. And how had he done it? Nobody knew. The scientists lay down in the dust of the common road and wailed and gibbered. They did not know. Military experts committed suicide by scores. The mighty fabric of warfare they had fashioned was a gossamer veil rent asunder by a miserable lunatic. It {{was too much for}} their sanity. Mere human reason could not withstand the shock.

60|$|One {{who reads}} {{a few of}} Shakespeare's great plays and then the meager story of his life is {{generally}} filled with a vague wonder. Here is an unknown country boy, poor and poorly educated according {{to the standards of}} his age, who arrives at the great city of London and goes to work at odd jobs in a theater. In a year or two he is associated with scholars and dramatists, the masters of their age, writing plays of kings and clowns, of gentlemen and heroes and noble women, all of whose lives he seems to know by intimate association. In a few years more he leads all that brilliant group of poets and dramatists who have given undying glory to the Age of Elizabeth. Play after play runs from his pen, mighty dramas of human life and character following one another so rapidly that good work seems impossible; yet they stand the test of time, and their poetry is still unrivaled in any language. For all this great work the author apparently cares little, since he makes no attempt to collect or preserve his writings. A thousand scholars have ever since been busy collecting, identifying, classifying the works which this magnificent workman tossed aside so carelessly when he abandoned the drama and retired to his native village. He has a marvelously imaginative and creative mind; but he invents few, if any, new plots or stories. He simply takes an old play or an old poem, makes it over quickly, and lo! this old familiar material glows with the deepest thoughts and the tenderest feelings that ennoble our humanity; and each new generation of men finds it more wonderful than the last. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it?

5000|$|Woodbury Kane - social leader, Fortune's favorite, aristocratic, refined, cultured, wealthy, haut ton de haut ton, and sabreur sans peur et sans reproche-how shall I paint him {{to you as}} I {{learned to}} know him in those dreadful, {{delightful}} seventeen days in which we lived only from instant to instant, and every man unconsciously bared his soul to his comrades {{because he could not}} help it?A gentleman-he always looked that in the fullest sense of the word. Well groomed; in those days when our bed was a mud-puddle and our canopy the stars, when the music which lulled us to sleep was the hum of the Mauser bullets and the vicious popping of the Remingtons, when water to drink had to be brought at the peril of life for every mouthful, Kane turned up every morning clean-shaved and neatly groomed, shoes duly polished, neat khaki, fitting like a glove and brushed to perfection, nails polished, and hair parted as nicely as if he were dressed by his valet in his New York apartments. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? We never knew. He kept no servant; he took his regular turn in the ditches, in the mud, or torrid sun, or smothering rain. No night alarm came that did not find Kane first to spring to the trench-and yet he did it, somehow. The courteous phrases of politest speech fell ever from his ready lips, as easily as they would have done in the boudoir of any belle in the metropolis. The shrieking of a shell or tingling hiss of a sharpshooter's close-aimed bullet never came so near as to interrupt whatever polished expression of thanks, regret, or comment he might be uttering. And it was the real thing, too. The gentle heart was there. No man was readier to bind a wound or aid a sun-struck soldier in the ranks; none more ready to deny himself a comfort or a luxury to help a more needy comrade. A braver man, a surer or more reliable officer, never trod in shoe-leather. A grand example to our pessimistic, socialistic friends and cheap demagogues of the sterling worth and noble, chivalric character of a [...] "society man of wealth."

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Sunnah {{has become}} synonymous with hadith as it is found {{primarily}} in the six canonical works of hadith. This change, Rahman argues, came about after Mohammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i articulated his bayan scheme, which in a nutshell means that the entirety of law resides in two texts the Qur'an and the Sunnah and that Sunnah is only the Sunnah of Muhammad (concept and content). In search for uniformity and stability, Rahman claims, that Shafi'i destroyed the living Sunnah or more precisely the organic relationship between Sunnah, ijtihad (progressive interpretation) and ijma. But was this living Sunnah conceptually linked to the """"Ideal Sunnah"""" of the Prophet? Why did Shafi'i decimate an entire tradition and what were his reasons and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? This thesis seeks {{to answer these questions}} by critically analyzing Rahman's living Sunnah notion. On the other hand whilst it appreciates Shafi'i's argument for the Sunnah, of the Prophet only, as the exclusive legislative supplement to the Qur'an it problematizes how Shafi'i dealt with the materials from which he reconstructed (the content) the Prophetic Sunnah (as a concept) ...|$|E

This tremendous growth and development is an achievement without parallel {{in the history of the}} accounting profession ’ [1, p. 61]. These glowing remarks were made in 1938 by Charles Jones, managing partner, at the twenty-fifth anniversary party of Arthur Andersen & Company. In twenty-five short years, Arthur Andersen built an accounting empire. But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? The answer is simple, but the effort was not.

40|$|Fritz Machlup {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} several main areas, including industrial organization, with {{particular emphasis on}} the production and distribution of knowledge, and international monetary economics. However, his role as methodologist concerns us here. As the long-term mentor of Edith Penrose, whose M. A. and Ph. D. he supervised at Johns Hopkins from 1947 to 1951, and whose work on The Theory of the Growth of the Firm he co-directed, Machlup as methodologist was {{in the position to}} influence the structure of her thinking and modeling of the process theory of the growth of firms. Did he do so and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so? These questions are the focus of this paper. While management scholars and economists have since the 1990 s begun to consider the Austrian influences on Penrose's work (Loasby 1991, 1999; Foss 1998; Mahoney and Michael 2005; Foss et al. 2006), little {{attention has been paid to}} the methodology underlying her process theory of the growth of firms and to the influence of Fritz Machlup. On the other hand, Machlup's methodology has been studied (Loasby 1976; Nelson and Winter 1982) and defended against the charge of neoclassical orthodoxy by Langlois and Koppl (1991) and Koppl (1992). In the sections that follow we explore the distinguishing features of that methodology and their appearance in The Theory of the Growth of the Firm. The principal sources used in this study are the publications of Fritz Machlup and Edith Penrose, as well as the letters exchanged throughout 1955 when Penrose was drafting The Theory of the Growth of the Firm...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cognitive processes involved in inductive reasoning. Sixteen undergraduates solved quadratic function–finding problems and provided concurrent verbal protocols. Three fundamental areas of inductive activity were identified: Data Gathering, Pattern Finding, and Hypothesis Generation. These activities are evident in three different strategies {{that they used to}} successfully find functions. In all three strategies, Pattern Finding played a critical role not previously identified in the literature. In the most common strategy, called the Pursuit strategy, participants created new quantities from x and y, detected patterns in these quantities, and expressed these patterns in terms of x. These expressions were then built into full hypotheses. The processes involved in this strategy are instantiated in an ACT-based model that simulates both successful and unsuccessful performance. The protocols and the model suggest that numerical knowledge is essential to the detection of patterns and, therefore, to higher-order problem solving. One of his teachers, apparently eager for a respite from the day’s lessons, asked the class to work quietly at their desks and add up the first hundred whole numbers. Surely this would occupy the little tykes for a good long time. Yet the teacher had barely spoken, and the other children had hardly proceeded past “ 1 � 2 � 3 � 4 � 5 � 15 ” when Carl walked up and placed the answer on the teacher’s desk. One imagines that the teacher registered a combination of incredulity and frustration at this unexpected turn of events, but a quick look at Gauss’s answer showed it to be perfectly correct. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it...|$|E
