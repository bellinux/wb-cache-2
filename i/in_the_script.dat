5|$|The {{script for}} Frank's Cock has been {{published}} several times, including <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> anthology By the Skin of Their Tongues and in the Journal of Film and Video (both 1997). The film influenced Adam Garnet Jones' Secret Weapons (2008), commissioned by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre in celebration of its fortieth anniversary. However, unlike Frank's Cock, Secret Weapons focused on an LGBT identity within Canada's native community.|$|E
5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, {{and told him to}} do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} Scandal, Kurosawa {{was approached}} by Daiei studios, which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, Shinobu Hashimoto, with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's experimental short story In a Grove, which recounts {{the murder of a}} samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the {{language}} was written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabic <b>script.</b> <b>The</b> French colonial administration introduced <b>the</b> Latin <b>script,</b> {{of which a}} modified version was officially decreed <b>in</b> 2009; <b>the</b> Arabic <b>script</b> remains widely used and literacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabic <b>script</b> is higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin <b>script.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, Konkani <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>script</b> {{is mainly}} {{used by the}} Christian {{community}} because the liturgy of <b>the</b> Catholic Church <b>in</b> Goa is entirely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>script</b> and <b>the</b> work of the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman is also carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>script.</b> However, {{a large number of}} writers outside the Christian Community also write in Romi Konkani. Konkani <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roman <b>script</b> is also used in Tiatr. Reginaldo Fernandes wrote Konkani novels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>Script</b> called Romanses.|$|R

5|$|Another notable {{production}} was in Belgrade, {{in the former}} Yugoslavia, in 1969. It was the first Hair to be produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by female producer-director Mira Trailović at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan Nikolić, Branko Milićević, Seka Sablić and Dušan Prelević. Over four years, the production received 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local references <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia's traditional rival.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} {{his vision of the}} 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{huge number}} of people who solely or {{primarily}} use <b>the</b> Roman <b>script.</b> As a result of the recognition of only <b>the</b> Devanagari <b>script,</b> <b>the</b> rich body of Konkani literature written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>script</b> goes unrecognised, unpromoted and unrewarded. When the Sahitya Akademi recognised Konkani in 1975 as an independent and literary language, one of the important factors was the well preserved literary heritage of Romi Konkani. After Konkani <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Devanagari <b>script</b> was made <b>the</b> official language of Goa <b>in</b> 1987, <b>the</b> Sahitya Akademi supported only writers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Devanagari <b>script</b> and writers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman <b>script</b> (as also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kannada <b>script)</b> are not eligible for the Sahitya Akademi awards and assistance.|$|R
5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E
5|$|In March, Sarah Lancaster, Joshua Gomez and Natalie Martinez {{were cast}} as Ellie Bartowski (Chuck's older sister), Morgan Pace (Chuck's best friend), and Kayla Hart (Chuck's {{neighbor}} and love interest), respectively. Gomez {{decided he wanted}} to be part of the pilot after reading there was a ninja <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Tony Todd and Wendy Makkena were cast as CIA Director Graham and the National Intelligence Director, General Mary Beckman. The casting for Beckman was narrowed to Makkena and Bonita Friedericy, with Mekenna ultimately being chosen. However, Mekenna only appeared in the pilot, and was replaced in the following episode by Friedericy as General Diane Beckman.|$|E
5|$|Jeethu had {{initially}} approached Mammootty {{to play the}} lead, but {{he was unable to}} commit and asked Jeethu to proceed with the film with another actor. According to the director, Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film. The director, in an interview with The New Indian Express, stated that he wrote the screenplay with Mohanlal in mind and that the character was tailor-made for Mohanlal. He later added that no changes were made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E

5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} he would find great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. Piller could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected this because they were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E
5|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun {{was the fourth}} and final film in the series {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set {{in the face of}} the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then popular martial arts film craze, with several kung fu scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau. Part of the film is also set in Beirut, Lebanon, but it was not shot there.|$|E

5|$|The death scenes {{required}} {{varying degrees}} of 2D and 3D graphic enhancement, with the roller coaster scene alone being composed of 144 visual-effect shots. Custom-designed coaster cars were created and modified, based on events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Most of the model was hand-built, with MEL scripts aiding specific elements. The coaster-crash scenes were filmed with the actors performing {{in front of a}} green screen with a CGI background. Several of the roller coaster's cars were suspended with bungee cords to film the crash, and the deaths required CGI onscreen effects; each actor had a corresponding CGI double.|$|E
5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize {{the horrors of the}} sex industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, an NBC pilot {{starring}} Cedric Hardwicke was made, but {{the sponsors}} were disappointed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scripts,</b> and <b>the</b> TV series never materialized.|$|R

5|$|Dual Destinies {{features}} animated cutscenes {{produced by}} the animation studio Bones, which were directed by Seto at Capcom and Kenji Nagasaki at Bones. The scripts for these were drafted by Yamazaki, and included characters' lines {{as well as the}} general events and backgrounds for each scene. After the scripts were written, they were sent to Nagasaki, who drew storyboards for the scenes. When boarding the sequences, he added suggestions for details and nuances; for instance, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> for one scene, Athena was going to trip and fall over, while Nagasaki suggested and boarded her tumbling down stairs, and added a guard character for her to interact with {{at the end of the}} scene to emphasize how painful the fall had been. After finalizing the scene, the team at Bones worked on the background art; while the courtrooms and defendant lobbies are shown in-game, the courthouse's stairway and main hall had not been shown before, and had to be designed specifically for the cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place {{at the peak of the}} February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included a line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the transcriptions of Chinese velar {{initials}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kitan Small <b>Script.</b> We carried out a phonological analysis of the Kitan language as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transcriptions by comparing the transcriptions of Chinese words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kitan Small <b>Script</b> with those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian/Uyghur <b>script.</b> This analysis demonstrates that Kitan has two velar consonants and one uvular consonant, and the transcriptions of the Chinese velar initials found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kitan Small <b>Script</b> reflect <b>the</b> distinction between velar and uvular consonants as seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian/Uyghur <b>script...</b>|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1950s, {{he was one}} of the first Mayanist {{scholars}} to give credence to the theories of the Russian linguist and ethnographer Yuri Knorozov concerning the phonetic and syllabic nature of <b>the</b> Maya <b>script,</b> which would later lead to breakthroughs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>script's</b> decipherment. Kelley's landmark 1962 paper, Phoneticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Maya <b>Script,</b> would provide important corroborating data of the phonetic interpretation of Maya glyphs, which ran counter to the then-prevailing view that <b>the</b> <b>script</b> lacked phonetic elements.|$|R
