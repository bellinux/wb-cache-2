40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a great deal of work on the {{formation}} of hard white-etching regions in conventional bearing steels such as 1 C- 1. 5 Cr wt% when subjected repeatedly to rolling contact stresses. The regions are a consequence of localised mechanical attrition across microcrack faces and mixing, which refine the local structure and force cementite to dissolve. This white-etching matter is often associated with brittle phenomena because the hardness can exceed 1100 HV. In contrast, carbide-free mixtures of bainitic ferrite and retained austenite when subjected to the same loading have been unexpectedly found not to develop the characteristic patches of hard material and to show instead signs of ductility in the attrited regions. The work presented here shows that the white-etching areas that develop in carbide-free bainite are softer than their surroundings, whether they are in hard nanostructured bainite destined for bearing applications or when the steel is designed for the manufacture of rails. Advanced characterisation tools were used for the first time to understand carbon redistribution during its formation. The deep interest about soft white-etching matter originates from the idea that it could lead to the reduction in premature failure of wind turbine gearbox bearings and white-etching layer <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails...</b>|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn urban areas, {{vibrations}} {{generated by}} railways {{have great importance}} because they influence {{the quality of life}} of neighbours in terms of ground borne noise. In order to reduce amplitudes of vibrations on the track, <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> has been used for several years on the Parisian network. The main drawback of this method is the generation of several small particles, who decrease air quality in tunnel and subway stations after the operation. Theses particles are a problem for working conditions of operatorÂ’s staff members. In order to reduce this concentration in underground spaces, a new method using milling and vacuum cleaning of samples has been tested. This method generates mush less dust but it modifies the rail profile, creating irregular facets witch may have an impact in terms of vibration generation. In order to evaluate vibration mitigation between grinding and milling methods, measurements have been performed on two sites on ballasted tracks: one on free flied and one in tunnel. Time history of transversal (head of rail) and vertical (under rail) vibrations have been recorded during weeks and results are given in terms of velocity in third octave bands. For free field site, an acoustic measurement is correlated to rail vibration measurements. For tunnel site, a vibration measurement on tunnel wall is correlated to vibration record on the rail. For the two sites, measurements have been recorded for several passages of different rolling stock, and statistical data has been extracted from these measurements. This presentation compares the two methods and presents the benefits for the neighbours in terms of ground borne vibrations in urban areas...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> is a {{technique}} widely used within the railway industry to balance the degradation of {{the condition of the}} rail with the required performance of the rail. The principal focus of this research is the impact of wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks on structural integrity of rails, and how rail grinding affects this relationship. A numerical model which predicts growth of RCF-initiated cracks in rails has been adapted to take into account periodic grinding of the surface of the rail. The suitability of some of the simplifying assumptions of the adapted model, referred to as the Grinding Model, has been examined with a physical test program, using full scale rail vehicles and track. This test program studied the persistence of the characteristic surface roughness of the rail generated by grinding, and was carried out to determine whether the effect of this roughness on crack growth can be neglected in the Grinding Model. The Grinding Model has been used to predict crack size, in order to investigate the effect of different grinding strategies, consisting of a depth of grinding applied at a certain interval during a representative pattern of rail vehicle traffic over the rail. The use of the Grinding Model to find grinding strategies which match an optimum criterion has been demonstrated. The applicability of this optimisation technique and the model in its current state of development, to the specification of rail grinding operations, in the context of maximising safe rail life and minimising rail life cycle cost, is discussed.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} rail profile {{optimization}} method that takes account of wear rate within design cycle {{so as to}} minimize rail wear at the curve in heavy haul railway and extend the service life <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> Taking rail wear rate as the object function, the vertical coordinate <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> profile at range optimization as independent variable, and the geometric characteristics and <b>grinding</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> profile as constraint conditions, the support vector machine regression theory was used to fit the nonlinear relationship between rail profile and its wear rate. Then, the profile optimization model was built. Based on the optimization principle of genetic algorithm, the profile optimization model was solved to achieve the optimal rail profile. A multibody dynamics model was used to check the dynamic performance of carriage running on optimal rail profile. The result showed that the average relative error of support vector machine regression model remained less than 10 % {{after a number of}} training processes. The dynamic performance of carriage running on optimized rail profile met the requirements on safety index and stability. The wear rate of optimized profile was lower than that of standard profile by 5. 8 %; the allowable carrying gross weight increased by 12. 7 %...|$|R

40|$|Rail {{grinding}} {{is currently}} being performed by considering the variations in rail profile measured through Grinding Quality Index (GQI) and has traditionally ignored rail surface condition. Often this profile based grinding leads to excess <b>grinding</b> and reduction <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> life. Consequently, a best practice approach for rail grinding comprising an updated index called Equivalent Quality Index (EQI) and economic decision model was proposed in this paper. The EQI incorporates the rail surface condition associated with rolling contact fatigue (RCF). However, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge and comprehensive technology in the market / industry to measure and quantify the RCF cracks and thus the surface condition. Consequently, a review and analysis was conducted on three non-destructive testing methods and concluded that the eddy current technology has potential to detect and quantify the cracks. In addition a data acquisition system and post processing software was developed to overcome the practical limitations of the eddy current device, such as sensitiveness and unwanted noise signals. The initial result from this proposed approach is discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Grinding {{has always}} been a high energy {{expenditure}} process, which generally produce massive grinding heat and possibly produce thermal damage in workpiece ground surface. Therefore, a good understanding <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> temperature characteristics is important to lower the thermal effect on the workpiece quality. However, the grinding temperature characteristic differs when <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> different materials, especially for those hard-to-machine materials (eg. Titanium alloys and ceramics). Therefore, this paper is devoted to investigate different grinding temperature characteristics for metallic materials and brittle materials. In order to detect the grinding temperature, a grindable thermocouple technique with NI-DAQ device is adopted in diamond wheel <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> ceramics and CBN <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> Titanium alloys. The results show that the temperature characteristics for ceramics is totally different with Titanium alloys. When the grinding wheel speed increases, the grinding temperature increases all the way when <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> Titanium alloys. However, there is a temperature turning point for <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> ceramics.
