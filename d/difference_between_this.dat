5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, and the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> pressure and the blood pressure, {{may be used to}} assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E

25|$|The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> true {{period and}} the period for small swings (1) above is called the {{circular}} error.

However, in this case, {{the death of the}} one actually is part of the plan to save the five.|$|E

25|$|In 1891, Lowe and Macpherson {{incorporated}} the Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad (later the Mount Lowe Railway). Unable to obtain all {{the rights of}} way to Mt. Wilson, the two men redirected their railway toward Oak Mountain via the Echo promontory. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> and any other scenic mountain railway of its kind {{was that it was}} an all-electric traction trolley (streetcar), the only one of its kind to ever exist. Oak Mountain was later renamed Mount Lowe, and to make it official, Andrew McNally, the co-founder of the map printing company Rand McNally who had moved to Altadena, had the name Mt. Lowe printed on all his maps.|$|E
25|$|Meehan ran for {{re-election}} in 2016. He defeated Stan Casacio in the Republican primary. He defeated Democrat Mary Ellen Balchunis {{in the general election}} with 60% of the vote.

Meehan won all the counties in the 7th Congressional District that include Delaware, Montgomery, Chester, Berks, and Lancaster counties. This is Meehan's fourth term in the 7th Congressional District. This election was a rematch of the election between Meehan and Balchinis in 2014. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> election and the one in 2014 is that this election occurred during a Presidential election year.|$|E

25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
25|$|The {{animation}} techniques behind Cuphead {{are similar}} to that of the 1930s cartoons. Chad Moldenhauer, who had previously worked in graphic design, would hand-draw the animations and paint the backgrounds using watercolors. He colorized the characters in Photoshop. The gameplay frame-rate of Cuphead runs at 60 frames per second, while the animation runs at 24 frames per second. There is a slight <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> and the traditional animation of 1930s cartoons. Chad Moldenhauer also saw his process with its human imperfections as a reaction to the perfectionism of pixel art. Jared Moldenhauer worked on other aspects of the game, though they would discuss gameplay design together. Their studio hired a Romanian developer, a Brooklyn animator, and an Ontario jazz musician for the project. They sought to keep the recording processes of the time period as if the team were developing in that era.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the difference between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E

500|$|On 20November 2007, a 20th anniversary {{edition of}} The Joshua Tree was released. The album was remastered from the {{original}} analogue recordings {{under the direction of}} the Edge, with the original vinyl album artwork restored. The release was made available in four formats: a single CD; a two-disc deluxe edition with a bonus audio CD of B-sides, rarities, and demos; a three-disc box set with the bonus audio CD and DVD, photograph prints, and hardcover book; and a double vinyl edition. All editions included liner notes by author Bill Flanagan and previously unseen photographs by Anton Corbijn. Manager Paul McGuinness explained, [...] "There has been continuous demand from U2 fans to have The Joshua Tree properly re-mastered. As always, the band had to make sure it was right, and now it is." [...] Some formats include expanded liner notes from the band members, the production team, and Anton Corbijn. In an otherwise favourable review of the remastered album, Andrew Mueller of Uncut said that [...] "any casual listener who can perceive a meaningful <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> and the original has i) ears like a bat and/or ii) needs to get out more".|$|E
500|$|While he {{was waiting}} for his paper to be published, O'Neill {{organized}} a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled First Conference on Space Colonization, was funded by Stewart Brand's Point Foundation and Princeton University. Among those who attended were Eric Drexler (at the time a freshman at MIT), scientist-astronaut Joe Allen (from Astronaut Group 6), Freeman Dyson, and science reporter Walter Sullivan. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned Space Shuttle. O'Neill thought of the attendees as [...] "a band of daring radicals". Sullivan's article on the conference was published {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. To stay in touch with them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. O'Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction. According to O'Neill, [...] "the profound <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>this</b> and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".|$|E

Wolf's characters are notoriously devoid of detailed personal lives, but debut [...] hints at a little more introspection {{on the part of}} the characters". In Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker wrote that Law & Order: Criminal Intent was the best series of the year from the Law & Order franchise and that while Law & Order suffered from tired, wooden performances from actors with poor chemistry, the acting on Law & Order: Criminal Intent was at [...] "the other end of the spectrum." [...] Both writers {{commented on the}} overpowering screen presence that D'Onofrio commands in the first episode: [...] "Criminal Intent so far is a one-man show with Vincent D'Onofrio at its center. [...] commands the most attention, tending to overshadow Erbe, who is reduced in the pilot to following Goren with an awe-struck look," [...] wrote Fries, while Tucker also stated, [...] "D'Onofrio is so eccentrically entertaining, even his costar Kathryn Erbe seems fascinated", but complained that Erbe's role was smaller than D'Onofrio's, which [...] "jibes with the subtle range she showed on [...] Oz and proves her professional generosity." [...] He also said Sheridan [...] "is similarly nonplussed and under-utilized," [...] but [...] "Vance is terrific , who makes defendants wither in the face of his elegantly reasoned cross-examinations." ...|$|E
