5000|$|The islands {{became part}} of a British Crown Colony in 1810. In 1820 the then Governor General of Mauritius granted jouissances in respect of the five groups as follows. He granted to Ozile Majestre alone a joussance {{exclusive}} over one group, the Iles Boisées, and to two individuals, Ozile Majestre and Dominique Bétuel, jouissances en partage over another group of six islands (Petits Foux, Lavocaire and four others). He granted three further jouissances exclusives to respectively M. Burceret (La Baleine and l’île aux Cocos), Mme. Veuve Raphaël (l’île Raphaël) and Mr William Stone (Ile Veronge and Ile aux Bois). All these jouissances were unlimited in time. Under a deed of transfer dated 4 September 1900, M. Louis Souchon, apparently the then owner of the jouissances relating to Iles Boisées and the six islands, sold the jouissances to the St Brandon <b>Fish</b> & <b>Manure</b> Co. Ltd. Under a second deed dated 20 September 1900 The Mauritius Cooperative Engrais Chimiques Co. Ltd., acting as owner of the remaining three jouissances, sold these to the St Brandon <b>Fish</b> & <b>Manure</b> Co. Ltd., which thus acquired all five groups of the St Brandon Archipelago. The Colonial Government was asked to give its consent to such sales, and on 19 October 1900 notified the purchaser company {{that it had no}} objection to the transfers provided that (in translation) “the jouissance which the said company possesses of the above islands and islets be converted in accordance with section 26 the 1874 Ordinance into a permanent lease”. The Government’s requirement was accepted by the purchaser company and led to the Deed of 11 October 1901. The Deed, described as a “permanent lease by the Colonial Government to the St Brandon <b>Fish</b> & <b>Manure</b> Company Limited” was executed on behalf of the government by the Surveyor-General, M.de Coriolis, who on the government’s behalf ratified the two September 1900 sales to the purchaser company. The Deed formally declared that “… the jouissance currently held by the St Brandon <b>Fish</b> & <b>Manure</b> Company Ltd of the islands and islets referred to above be converted to a permanent lease in accordance with the above Ordinance, the company claiming the rights of those to whom the Government of Mauritius granted it originally” and that the lease was to commence as from 2 October 1901[...] The “permanent lease” contained a number of conditions. In particular, the St Brandon Company was to export all the guano it found on the islands and to pay the Government a royalty of 5 rupees per ton. All the produce of the islands was to be sent to Mauritius.Furthermore “les clauses & conditions contenues aux actes de concession de la suds: jouissance sont maintenues dans leur intégralité & lieront la Société … envers le Gouvernement Colonial….” The company was also to pay the Government an annual sum of one rupee,which was due on 2 October each year.|$|R

5000|$|The mystery deepened when on 2 September 1914, the Mercury {{provided}} {{further details}} of the event in their article [...] "The Norfolk Bay Tragedy - A mysterious occurrence - The {{details of the}} event"THE NORFOLK BAY TRAGEDY. A MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE. THE DETAILS OF THE EVENT.Fuller details which have come to hand of the drowning tragedy in Norfolk Bay, by which Mr. C. Wellard lost his life, show that the whole affair is a mystery.On the night before Mr. Wellard’s disappearance he stayed on the island with Mr. David Kingston, of Koonys. In the morning Mr. Wellard took several sheep out in his dinghy, {{and put them on}} board the s.s. Breone. He then went back to the island, and Mr Kingston helped him load the dinghy with six bags of <b>fish</b> <b>manure,</b> weighing some 7cwt ((approximately 317.5kg)), which, with a lamb in the bag and three dogs, formed the dinghy’s freight. Mr. Wellard then put out from the island in his dinghy, intending to cross to King George’s Sound {{on the west side of}} Forestier’s Peninsula and several miles from Garden Island, near which his home lay. The captain of the s.s. Breone offered to give him a tow for part of his journey, as the steamer would be going past the mouth of the Sound, and the dinghy was made fast to the steamer. As soon as the Breone got under way the captain noticed that the dinghy was slopping water over the bows. He then told Mr. Wellard he did not think the dinghy would stand towing, on which the latter asked him to cast off, which was at once done. The dinghy was then about 200 yards from the Garden Island jetty, but nor more than 60 or 70 yards from the nearest point on the island.When the dinghy was cast loose from the steamer, Mr. Wellard at once turned round and started to pull back to the jetty. Presumably he intended to get a bailer, as it was noticed that he had not one on board. The steamer rounded a point, and those on board lost sight of him before he reached the jetty.Mr. Wellard was never seen again, and what happened remains a mystery. He had no sail up at the time he was last seen. The dinghy is a stiff little boat, and it is hard to imagine how she got bottom upwards. The fact remains that she did turn over, and was found floating bottom upwards three days later. One of the dogs got on the bottom of the boat, and had been there three days and three nights before the boat was found.The deepest sympathy is felt for Mr. Wellard’s family and relatives. He was a young man in the prime of life, with a wife and two young children. He had established a farm and orchard in the bush, near Murdunna, and was working hard with good prospects of success.On 4 September 1914, S. N. Wellard discussed his nephew's death in the Mercury in his letter entitled 'Norfolk Bay Tragedy'.:To the Editor of [...] "The Mercury". Sir, —Being the late Charles Wellard's uncle and owner of Garden Island, I would like to explain to the public how I think the sad accident occurred. After driving the sheep on the s. s. Breonce (I would like here to say there is a good jetty on Garden Island, and all stock is loaded from it) Mr. David Kingston helped me to load the dinghy with <b>fish</b> <b>manure.</b> The dinghy is 14 ft. long and about 5 ft. beam, and thoroughly sea-worthy. No doubt, after being towed a short distance by the vessel, he re-turned to the Island, bailed out and made another start with a full load. A north-east wind sprang up when he was crossing, a little slop was going over and wetting the manure making it very much heavier. Mr. Kingston said he put the load in the bow of the boat, a very unusual thing for him to do and he was sitting down on the well (which was corked up) pulling. No doubt when he saw danger he threw the bag off the well, it being easy to get at. This would most likely cause the boat to go down head foremost, and roll over. Mr Dalton, from the opposite shore saw a dinghy about noon three-parts of the way across to the mainland. When he returned to his work he could not see it, and he presumed it was someone fishing who had gone home. It was also seen by Mr Dodridge, of Dunalley, about the same time. A bailer was picked up with name on it and several other things on Chronicle Point [...] Yours, etc., S. N. WELLARD.|$|E

Eight ponds were constructed during dry season in two sites besides two floodplain lakes, Ruwe and Uba. These ponds were self-stocked with different fish species from the lakes. More than eight species were trapped and O. urolepis was considered as a good candidate for aquaculture. Other fish species were harvested immediately after flood recession and O. urolepis was cultured for the maximum of six months. Some species like Labeo congoro and Clarias gariepinus were redistributed in the ponds. However, other species in small quantities were remained in the ponds for the whole period of experiment. Water quality parameters were monitored throughout the study period. The relationships between water quality variables and flooding events were determined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Other parameters included in the relationships were <b>fish</b> density, <b>manure</b> and number of species trapped and cultured. Dissolved oxygen and pH decreased with time in both sites. Fish yields were influenced by some water quality and flooding episode variables. Chlorophyll-a was the only environmental variable that showed a significant correlation with fish yield (P< 0. 01). Fish density and number of species trapped showed a significant effect on the fish yield (P< 0. 05). Re-connectivity between ponds and lakes was strongly positively correlated with yield.

In this study we investigated the impact of integrated fish farming on the levels of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in a pond environment. One integrated broiler chicken-fish farm was studied for 2 months immediately {{after the start of}} a new fish production cycle. A significant increase over time in the resistance to six different antimicrobials was found for the indicator organism Acinetobacter spp. isolated from composite water-sediment samples. The initial resistance levels prior to the new production cycle were 1 to 5 %. After 2 months the levels of resistance to oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole reached 100 %, and the levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin were more than 80 %. The long-term effects of resistance on integrated farming were studied on seven additional farms. The resistance levels were particularly high among Enterococcus spp. and were also high among Acinetobacter spp. isolated from water-sediment samples compared to the resistance levels at four control farms. In conclusion, integrated fish farming seems to favor antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the pond environment. This could be attributed to the selective pressure of antimicrobials in the pond environment and/or to the introduction of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from animal manure.

40|$|Background: The AquaPonic {{system is}} an {{eco-friendly}} recycling method {{that can save}} energy and reduce the impact of environmental pollution from <b>fish</b> <b>manure</b> by utilizing it as a nutrient for plant growth. The aquaponic system is required to measure and control the suitability and efficiency of the circulation system depending on the concentration of the ammonium ion and the nitrate ion. For the measurement of nitrate and ammonium ions, ISE (Ion Selective Electrodes) were fabricated and applied to the designed system. Methods: ISE were prepared for the measurement and analysis of ammonium and nitrate ions, which {{are the most important}} components of nitrogen circulation in the fish excrement of the designed aquaponic-system. The temperature, humidity, light composition and light intensity of plant growing area were controlled to collect meaningful information about growth of the plant. Lettuce was cultivated in a total of 60 ports and cultivated in a hydroponic cultivation method using fish excrement as a nutrient. Nitrate and ammonium ions were measured at 24 hour intervals for 1 month of growth of tilapia and lettuce. In order to investigate the growth of lettuce, weights and length were collected and the images of tilapia were obtained at feeding to determine the growth of tilapia. Results: The analysis of the weight, length, and nutrients of the lettuce grown in the designed aqua phonics system showed that the designed aquaponic-system is an efficient system. Discussions: In order to design an aquaponic-system for various crops and species, it is considered necessary to conduct experiments on aquaponic-system which combines various crops and species. Further research on the algorithm that can control the system in optimum environment is needed by collecting information about growth of plant and fish in controlled environment.

Using radioactive labelling techniques, the fertilization effects of dairy <b>manure,</b> <b>fish</b> sludge, meat bone meal and wood ash were studied as P uptake by barley after 44 days and compared with those of water-soluble mineral P (MinP) and an unfertilized control (NoP) in a pot experiment with an agricultural soil containing little available P at two soil pH levels, approximately pH 5. 3 (unlimed soil) and pH 6. 2 (limed soil). In a parallel incubation experiment, the effects of the secondary resources on physicochemical and microbial soil processes were studied. The results showed that the relative agronomic efficiency compared with MinP decreased in the order: <b>manure</b> ≥ <b>fish</b> sludge ≥ wood ash ≥ meat bone meal. The solubility of inorganic P in secondary resources was the main driver for P uptake by barley (Hordeum vulgare). The effects of secondary resources on physicochemical and microbial soil processes were of little overall importance. Application of organic carbon with manure resulted in microbial P immobilisation and decreased uptake by barley of P derived from the soil. On both soils, P uptake by barley was best explained by a positive linear relationship with the H 2 O + NaHCO 3 -soluble inorganic P fraction in fertilizers, or by a linear negative relationship with the HCl-soluble inorganic P fraction in fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted for 6 weeks (between August and September 2010) with 4 treatments (T 1 : poultry manure, T 2 : cattle manure, T 3 : poultry and cattle manure and T 4 : control-nomanure) assigned to 8 concrete ponds at random to determine chlorophyll a and total phosphorusabundance in organic <b>manured</b> <b>fish</b> ponds. Results {{of the study}} suggest that T 1, T 2, and T 3 had an effecton chlorophyll a and total phosphorus abundance in organic manured ponds. The final mean average forchlorophyll a ranged from 0. 0105 mg/m 3 to 0. 045 mg/m 3 and that of total phosphorus ranged from 0. 024 mg/ 50 mL to 0. 522 mg/ 50 mL. Chlorophyll a and phosphorus were positively correlated with acoefficient of 0. 92 and it was significant (p ≤ 0. 05). However, weekly performance of chlorophyll a andtotal phosphorus was higher in T 3 compared to other treatments. The treatments also showeddifferences {{in the number of}} plankton species available. Phytoplankton species in T 3 increased from 888 in week three to 933 in week six. However, the zooplankton species reduced from 10 in week three to 4 in week six compared to other treatments. These results indicate that animal manure varied ininfluencing the production of chlorophyll a, planktons and phosphorus. The variation may be attributed tofeed nutritive value of the animals to which they were fed. Farmers should therefore be encouraged touse a combination of poultry and cattle manure to obtain maximum benefits in increasing chlorophyll aand total phosphorus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of agricultural soils in the tropical regions of the Pacific is the low organic matter content. Because of the hot and humid environment, the soil organic matter (SOM) is minimal due to rapid decomposition. Composted organic material is being applied on agricultural fields as an amendment to provide nutrients and enhance the organic matter content for improving the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the cultivated soils. In addition land application of composted material as a fertilizer source effectively disposes of wastes that otherwise are buried in landfills. In our soil program at the University of Guam, we are evaluating the use of organic material as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers. Its goal is to develop management strategies and use available resources for improving crop production while conserving resources and preserving environmental quality. Our case study project is designed to improve soil fertility status by using composted organic wastes and assessing how the nitrogen and other essential nutrients contribute to long-term soil fertility and crop productivity without application of synthetic fertilizers. In our pilot project, compost is produced from wood chips, grinded typhoon debris mixed with animal <b>manure,</b> <b>fish</b> feed, shredded paper and other organic wastes. Mature compost is then applied on the field at the rates of 0, 5, 10 and 20 t/ha as a soil amendment on the eroded cobbly soils of southern Guam. Corn is planted and monitored for growth performance and yield. The effect of land application of composted material on th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring composting, {{facilities}} usually exert {{greater control}} over the bio-oxidative phase of the process, which uses a specific technology and generally has a fixed duration. After this phase, the material is deposited to mature, with less monitoring during the maturation phase. While there has been considerable study of biological parameters during the thermophilic phase, there is less research on the stabilization and maturation phase. This study evaluates {{the effects of the}} type of starting material on the evolution of microbial dynamics during the maturation phase of composting. Three waste types were used: sludge from the fish processing industry, municipal sewage sludge and pig manure, each independently mixed with shredded pine wood as bulking agent. The composting system for each waste type comprised a static reactor with capacity of 600 L for the bio-oxidative phase followed by stabilization and maturation phase in triplicate 200 L boxes for 112 days. Phospholipid fatty acids, enzyme activities and physico-chemical parameters were measured throughout the maturation phase. The evolution of the total microbial biomass, Gram + bacteria, Gram − bacteria, fungi and enzymatic activities (β-glucosidase, cellulase, protease, acid and alkaline phosphatase) depended significantly on the waste type (p< 0. 001). The predominant microbial community for each waste type remained present throughout the maturation process, indicating that the waste type determines the microorganisms that are able to develop at this stage. While fungi predominated during <b>fish</b> sludge maturation, <b>manure</b> and municipal sludge were characterized by a greater proportion of bacteria. Both the structure of the microbial community and enzymatic activities provided important information for monitoring the composting process. More attention should be paid to the maturation phase in order to optimize composting...|$|R
40|$|A multi fuel {{biogas plant}} is under {{planning}} at Fiborgtangen, Norway. The plant will utilize biogas from several different sources, including <b>fish</b> silage, animal <b>manures,</b> sludge {{from the paper}} factory and straw. In order to make good decisions on how to design the plant, characterization of the substrates in regards to biogas potential and nutrient value was done, and laboratory scale models of a possible plant design was established. The characterization showed that a minimum of 42 % of the DM should come from manure {{in order to meet}} the micro-nutrient demand, it also showed that some nitrogen rich substrates in addition to the manure needed to be present to avoid nitrogen limitation to balance out the high carbon substrates. A biochemical methane potential study was carried out for all substrates and showed promising results, with the exception of the fiber sludge from the paper factory that had a very poor methane potential. The mixed substrate fed to the reactor models gave a methane yield of 300 mL CH 4 /gVS in the biochemical methane potential study. A mix of all the substrates was fed to 4 semi continuous reactors with a HRT of 25 days and OLR of 3 gVS/L. The reactors performance was unstable, and operating with high propionic acid concentrations. The specific methane yield ranged from 170 - 230 mL CH 4 /gVS, but because the reactors did not reach steady state during the experimental period and the propionic acid concentrations were so high, it is not possible to conclude on what yield this design would give. It is recommended that the semi continuous experiments are continued until they reach steady state or collapse because of the high propionic acid concentrations. After this it would be recommended to start experiments with higher proportions of animal manure and to leave the fiber sludge out of the reactor feed as it is has very low methane and nutrient value. </p...|$|R
