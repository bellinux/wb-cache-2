5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient <b>for</b> <b>reaching</b> high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} baseball event in Australia {{took place in}} Melbourne, Victoria in 1857, between teams from Collingwood and Richmond. Accounts vary as to the details, including {{whether it was a}} single game or a series of threegames, though details in common include a score of 350–230 in favour of Collingwood, and that the rules used were some form of hybrid between cricket and baseball, with teams batting until all players were out, and runs being scored for every base crossed, rather than just <b>for</b> <b>reaching</b> home plate. Though there are no records to confirm it, the commonly held belief is that baseball in Australia originated on the Ballarat gold-fields among American miners. The Claxton Shield, the first annually recurring national tournament, commenced in 1934. Though the tournament itself has been supplanted at various points in its history, the physical Shield is still awarded to the national champions in the Australian Baseball League. From 2011, the national champions will meet other champions from Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in the Asia Series.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{received}} significant financial rewards <b>for</b> <b>reaching</b> the Champions League final. However, despite {{losing the}} match, it was Manchester United who earned {{the most money}} from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281million compared to Barcelona's €30.968million. All 32 teams in the group stage of the competition received €3million for {{taking part in the}} competition and €2.4million for their participation in the group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (€600,000 for each win and €300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of €2.7million, while Manchester United earned €2.4million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of €7.7million for their participation in the rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of €7million for winning the final, while Manchester United received €4million for finishing as runners-up. The biggest difference between the teams' financial rewards came {{as a result of their}} share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (€18.781million) of approximately €55.5million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in La Liga the previous season, and so received the second-smallest share of the €33.8million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home €8.168million.|$|E

Following this, he was voted Player of the Round for the FA Cup first round. In the following match, he scored his first hat-trick for York, with three goals in a 3–2 home win over Chester City on 10 November 2009. After picking up a yellow card against AFC Wimbledon on 21 November 2009, Brodie was handed a one-match suspension, which resulted in him missing a match against Gateshead. He was named the Conference Premier Player of the Month for November 2009, during which he scored six goals in five appearances. Brodie scored his 20th goal {{of the season in}} a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham, a result that equalled the club record for successive victories in all competitions with eight. This goal broke the club record <b>for</b> <b>reaching</b> 20 goals in a season in the quickest time, beating Arthur Bottom's record by six days. Brodie played for York in the FA Cup third round against Premier League team Stoke City, in which they were beaten 3–1 away. He scored two goals and provided an assist in a 4–1 home win over Hayes & Yeading United, which broke the club record for consecutive league victories with eight. League Two team Grimsby Town made an offer for Brodie in January 2010, with chairman John Fenty's offer being rejected as it did not meet York's valuation.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} recommenced its explorations in May 1860. Raynolds led a party {{north and}} west up the upstream portion of the Bighorn River, which is today called the Wind River, hoping to cross the mountains at Togwotee Pass in the Absaroka Range, a mountain pass known to expedition guide Jim Bridger. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back north to the Bighorn River to explore it and its associated tributary streams more thoroughly. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at Three Forks, Montana, so they could make observations of a total solar eclipse forecast for July 18, 1860. Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter {{to the top of}} Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline <b>for</b> <b>reaching</b> Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass in the northern Wind River Range that Raynolds named Union Pass, to the west of which lay Jackson Hole and the Teton Range. From there the expedition went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at Teton Pass and entering Pierre's Hole in present-day Idaho. Though Raynolds and his party managed to get to Three Forks by the scheduled date, Maynadier's party was several days late, which prevented a detachment heading north to observe the solar eclipse. The reunited expedition then headed home, traveling from Fort Benton, Montana, to Fort Union near the Montana-North Dakota border via steamboat. It then journeyed overland to Omaha, Nebraska, where the expedition members were disbanded in October 1860.|$|E
5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary <b>for</b> <b>reaching</b> new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E

40|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that gray wolves (Canis lupus) were extirpated {{from the upper}} Gallatin River Basin in the early 1900 s. Following the removal of these large carnivores, elk (Cervis elaphus) began to increasingly browse streamside vegetation in the winter range, causing widespread loss of formerly extensive willow (Salix spp.) communities. Historical aerial photographs and chronosequences of ground photographs were used to characterize general changes in vegetation and channel morphology over time. In August of 2004, riparian vegetation and channel cross-sections were surveyed along three reaches of the upper Gallatin River. Reach A was located upstream of the elk winter range (control reach) whereas reaches B and C (treatment reaches) were located within the elk winter range. Willow cover on floodplains averaged 85 per cent <b>for</b> <b>reach</b> A, but only 26 per cent and 5 per cent <b>for</b> <b>reaches</b> B and C, respectively.
