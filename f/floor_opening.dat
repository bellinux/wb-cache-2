40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{requests}} assistance in preventing injuries and deaths from falls of workers through skylights and roof and <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b> Recent NIOSH investigations suggest that employers, workers, building owners, skylight designers, and skylight manufacturers may not fully recognize or appreciate the serious fall hazards associated with working near skylights and roof and <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b> As a result, skylights and roof and <b>floor</b> <b>openings</b> may be left unguarded or uncovered, and workers may {{be assigned to}} work around these openings without appropriate fall prevention measures in place. This Alert describes five deaths resulting from falls through skylights and roof and <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b> Recommendations are provided to help prevent similar deaths in the future. The recommendations in this Alert should be followed by (1) all building owners and (2) all employers and workers at worksites that may expose workers to unguarded skylights and roof and <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b> In addition, skylight designers and manufacturers should contribute to worker safety through improved design and labeling of skylights. NIOSH requests that safety and health professionals, government officials, industry associations, unions, and editors of trade journals bring the recommendations in this Alert {{to the attention of}} employers and workers.

60|$|There he {{saw that}} the bank {{building}} was a two-story affair, the entrance to the second story being at {{the left side of the}} first <b>floor,</b> <b>opening</b> directly onto the sidewalk in full view of the sentry who paced to and fro before the structure.|$|E
60|$|The gang {{slipped away}} {{through the early}} morning twilight. The next eye to gaze upon the miserable Goree was the orb of day. He peered through the uncurtained window, first deluging the sleeper in a flood of faint gold, but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a searching, white, summer heat. Goree stirred, half unconsciously, among the table's débris, and turned his face from the window. His {{movement}} dislodged a heavy law book, which crashed upon the <b>floor.</b> <b>Opening</b> his eyes, he saw, bending over him, {{a man in a}} black frock coat. Looking higher, he discovered a well-worn silk hat, and beneath it the kindly, smooth face of Colonel Abner Coltrane.|$|E
50|$|Openings to {{the ground}} floor have moulded plaster surrounds, and retain some early joinery and leadlight glazing, {{although}} there are some replacement louvres. First <b>floor</b> <b>openings</b> are generally inward opening, half glazed, french doors with operable fanlights above.|$|R
50|$|The ground <b>floor</b> <b>openings</b> {{have been}} {{substantially}} altered {{with the addition}} of the tiled and rendered brick infill work, though some survive intact. Half glazed french doors with operable transom windows give access to the verandah from the upper floors.|$|R
5000|$|A {{separate}} {{store with}} a hipped roof, filling in the [...] "L" [...] shape plan to create a rectangle, has been incorporated into the structure. A verandah {{has been added to}} the eastern back wall. Leadlight windows remain in some of the ground <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|R

Taking {{the frame}} {{structure}} of a floor partial discontinuity as an example, the paper using ANSYS software, analyzed dynamic characteristics of the structure, discussed the influence of <b>floor</b> <b>openings</b> size on {{the period of the}} structure, which provided reference for the design of floor partial discontinuity building...|$|R
50|$|Externally {{the main}} body of the church is an undistinguished 19th century building. The plan is nearly a plain {{rectangle}} with rendered brick walls and a low pitched slate roof. The side windows are typical iron frames of the period, with separate gallery and ground <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b> The East end features the 1872 Neo-gothic window with three lights.|$|R

50|$|A {{machicolation}} (mâchicoulis) is a <b>floor</b> <b>opening</b> {{between the}} supporting corbels of a battlement, through which stones or other material, such as boiling water or boiling cooking oil, could be dropped on attackers {{at the base}} of a defensive wall. A smaller version found on smaller structures is called a box-machicolation.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} has bronze framed, single-glazed, double-hung windows of varying proportions. Typically, the first <b>floor</b> <b>openings</b> are glazed with double four-over-six sash and are surmounted by fixed transoms. Floors two and seven have double, four-over-six sash without transoms. Floors three through six and eight through ten have paired, double-hung sash with four-over-four lights grouped vertically and separated by fluted bronze spandrels.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{extension}} - {{designed by}} architects Messr Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners of London - saw all classrooms {{moved to the}} first and second floors, with the open-plan student areas on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>opening</b> up to the playing fields. New facilities within the extension included: science laboratories; needlework and housecraft rooms; and geography classrooms with a terrace that linked them to the observatory on the roof.|$|E

[...] Then from under his bed, his pet bobtail dog Wordsworth would appear holding the torch in his mouth. Jamie would take the torch and shine it on the <b>floor,</b> <b>opening</b> up a portal to Cuckoo Land (which Wordsworth always got stuck in). The portal manifested itself as a helter skelter.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, the Lindenstraße Synagogue was {{the subject}} of a {{memorial}} designed by Zvi Hecker, Eyal Weizmann, and sculptor Micha Ullman. In the courtyard of the present office building, they designed an arrangement of concrete benches placed in the pattern of the seating in the original synagogue. The courtyard and memorial is accessed through a large ground <b>floor</b> <b>opening,</b> much like the central passageway that figured prominently in the Cremer & Wolffenstein synagogue.|$|E

Large ground <b>floor</b> <b>openings</b> with bi-fold doors allowed ready access directly to the street for quick exit of horse and sulky.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a procedure for {{finite element analysis}} of hollow-core slab floors, which may be necessary in case of large <b>floor</b> <b>openings.</b> Formulas for homogenisation of the floor properties are presented. Finite element modelling is discussed. Formulas for stress recovery are presented. As an example a floor is analysed with a 3 x 3. 6 m opening. Key words: Hollow-core slabs, trimmer, homogenisation, stress recovery, analysis procedure...|$|R
50|$|Escalators {{sometimes}} include {{fire protection}} systems including automatic fire detection and suppression systems within the dust collection and engineer pit. To limit the danger caused by overheating, spaces that contain motors and gears typically include additional ventilation. Small, targeted clean agent automatic extinguishing systems are sometimes installed in these areas. Fire protection of an escalator <b>floor</b> <b>opening</b> is also sometimes provided by adding automatic sprinklers or fireproof shutters to the opening, or by installing the escalator in an enclosed fire-protected space.|$|E
50|$|The Stamford House is a {{variation}} of the Venetian Renaissance architectural style that was popular in commercial buildings in the Victorian period. It has an appealing, romantic architectural composition with its curved central pediment and two triangular ones at either end. With its Adamesque-like mouldings and elaborate ornamental devices, the three-storey Stamford House is typical of the High Victorian phase. The building has an arcade which allows natural light to enter. It mainly housed offices, with shops on the ground <b>floor</b> <b>opening</b> on to a five-foot way.|$|E
