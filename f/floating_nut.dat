50|$|Retainer weld nuts, {{also known}} as bridge weld nuts, have a <b>floating</b> <b>nut</b> {{retained}} inside a retainer to compensate for inconsistencies. The retainer is welded to the workpiece while the nut is allowed to float.|$|E
50|$|Locknut {{types are}} available, which utilize {{deformed}} threads or a nylon locking element, {{much like a}} nyloc nut. These locking plate nuts are used when the nut is subjected to constant changes in environment or to vibration. The nylon insert expands and stops vibrations of the nut and acts as a locking arrangement. Other types have a <b>floating</b> <b>nut</b> or replaceable locking elements. A typical U.S. military specification for plate nuts is MS21047.|$|E
40|$|Modified adjustable-grip-length {{quick-release}} pin holds two bodies together. Threaded shaft of pin threaded in <b>floating</b> <b>nut</b> to pretension fastener. Pin connects and disconnects rapidly and adjusted to accommodate small differences between thicknesses of nominally identical sets of parts to {{be attached to}} each other...|$|E
40|$|Saddle clamp {{modified}} to prevent parts from falling off when installed or removed. Allows easy access for tightening or loosening bolts, and retains alignment with tube mounted in it when opened. All parts are held captive - bolts by retaining washers, <b>floating</b> <b>nuts</b> by pressing and swaging, and upper clamp band by tether. Upper and lower bolt flanges offset {{from each other}} to ensure access...|$|R
50|$|Nut {{and tree}} of the coco de mer, a rare species of palm tree {{native to the}} Seychelles {{archipelago}} in the Indian Ocean, is subject of various legends and lore. Coco de mer is endemic to the Seychelles islands of Praslin and Curieuse. Before the Seychelles were discovered and settled, nuts of this species were sometimes carried by the ocean currents to distant shores, {{such as those of}} the Maldives, where the tree was unknown. These <b>floating</b> <b>nuts</b> did not germinate. The exceptional size and suggestive form of the nut, the circumstances of its discovery, and some unusual qualities of the trees have given rise to several legends.|$|R
50|$|Nipa palms grow in soft mud and slow-moving tidal {{and river}} waters that bring in nutrients. The palm {{can be found}} as far inland as the tide can deposit the <b>floating</b> <b>nuts.</b> It is common on coasts and rivers flowing into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, from Bangladesh to the Pacific Islands. The plant will survive {{occasional}} short-term drying of its environment. It is considered native to China (Hainan region), the Ryukyu Islands, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Borneo, Java, Maluku, Malaya, the Philippines, Sulawesi, Sumatra, the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Caroline Islands, Queensland, and the Australian Northern Territory. It is reportedly naturalized in Nigeria, the Society Islands of French Polynesia, the Mariana Islands, Panama, and Trinidad.|$|R
40|$|Proposed {{mechanism}} placed behind panel fastens panel to, or unfastens it from, underlying structure. Electric {{motor and}} gearbox drives bolt to engage or disengage captive <b>floating</b> <b>nut.</b> Used where head at outer end of bolt or other fastener covered with protective outer layer on panel and inner end of bolt inaccessible...|$|E
40|$|A <b>floating</b> <b>nut</b> {{retention}} system includes a nut {{with a central}} aperture. An inner retainer plate has an opening which is fixedly aligned with the nut aperture. An outer retainer member is formed of a base plate having an opening and a surface adjacent to a surface of the inner retainer plate. The outer retainer member includes a securing mechanism for retaining the inner retainer plate adjacent to the outer retainer member. The securing mechanism enables the inner retainer plate to float {{with respect to the}} outer retainer number, while simultaneously forming a bearing surface for inner retainer plate...|$|E
5000|$|Jallab (Arabic: جلاب / ALA-LC: jallāb) {{is a type}} {{of fruit}} syrup popular in the Middle East made from carob, dates, grape {{molasses}} and rose water.Jallab is very popular in Jordan, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon. It is made mainly of grape molasses and artificial coloring, then smoked with Arabic incense. It is usually sold with crushed ice and <b>floating</b> pine <b>nuts</b> and raisins.|$|R
50|$|Best-known {{from this}} period, Lane’s Etruscan Chair (1985) is {{featured}} in several museum collections. The piece was constructed from inch-thick <b>float</b> glass, industrial <b>nuts</b> and bolts, forged stainless steel and aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The base {{is made by}} infusing dried {{magnolia}} berries {{in water}} until the color develops, sieving the liquid through a fine cloth, then sweetening with honey, sugar, or syrup. It is served with decorative slices of pear and pine <b>nuts</b> <b>floating</b> at the top.|$|R
50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor <b>nuts</b> and as <b>floating</b> anchor <b>nuts.</b> The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R
60|$|There were various {{opinions}} about Adam's speech: {{some of the}} women whispered that he didn't show himself thankful enough, and seemed to speak as proud as could be; but most of the men were of opinion that nobody could speak more straightfor'ard, and that Adam was as fine a chap as need to be. While such observations were being buzzed about, mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a bailiff, and whether {{he was going to have}} a steward, the two gentlemen had risen, and were walking round to the table where the wives and children sat. There was none of the strong ale here, of course, but wine and dessert--sparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good sherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table, and Totty was now seated in her lap, bending her small nose deep down into a wine-glass in search of the <b>nuts</b> <b>floating</b> there.|$|R
