The long snapper snaps the football {{directly to the}} punter, who then drops and kicks it before it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR) – the player that catches the punt.|$|E
5|$|Hysterical Lydia, {{who thought}} Sarah and Zoe were having an affair, had a {{conversation}} with Charlotte and revealed when they split up, she attempted suicide, proving the character's vulnerability. After sabotaging Zoe's parachute, they are mixed up and a terrified Lydia began to worry that she might have got the sabotaged parachute. While doing the jump, Zoe's deploys, however Sarah's does not. As she <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> Lydia screams in terror. She is completely destroyed by Sarah's death, but does not admit to being responsible when Zoe is arrested, and with that Lydia tries to commit suicide once again.|$|E
5|$|The girl can {{stabilize}} wobbling dishes {{by pressing}} {{the button on}} the controller.

The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Enlisting {{the help}} of the Stabbington Brothers, a duo of muscular thieves who were once betrayed by Flynn, Gothel offers them both revenge on Flynn Rider and Rapunzel's gift once they agree to help her find them, not {{intending}} to keep the latter half of her promise as she only wants Rapunzel for herself. When her initial attempt to convince Rapunzel to return home with her fails, Gothel, upon a second encounter, tricks the Stabbington Brothers into immobilizing Flynn, later knocking them unconscious when they attempt to kidnap Rapunzel. Convincing Rapunzel that Flynn has betrayed her, they return to the tower. While Flynn escapes from the dungeon, Rapunzel suddenly realizes her true identity and rebels against Gothel, only to be chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Flynn upon his arrival to rescue Rapunzel, but agrees to free Rapunzel long enough to heal him on the condition that she remain with her forever. However, Flynn unexpectedly cuts Rapunzel's hair, causing it to lose its magic. It turns brown, and a horrified Gothel (failing to salvage Rapunzel's hair) ages rapidly, falling out of the tower's window but disintegrating into dust before she <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> essentially dying of old age. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms, but is miraculously returned to life by Rapunzel's tear, and she is finally reunited with her biological parents.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} up from Sarah, Lydia becomes jealous of Zoe and Sarah's friendship. Lydia then begins {{going out with}} Sarah again although she is more invested in the relationship with Sarah. Lydia's true colours start to show when she tells Sarah she has received dead flowers on her and former girlfriend Charlotte's anniversary, she tells Sarah she thinks they are from Charlotte, she then shows the same bouquet to Charlotte and accuses Zoe. It is then revealed during an argument with Charlotte that Lydia tried to kill herself when she and Charlotte split up. Lydia sees Sarah and Zoe going on an adventure holiday with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and is jealous when she takes Zoe. Lydia follows them and has an argument with Sarah. She continues to pretend Charlotte is stalking her {{in order to gain}} sympathy. When left alone with Zoe, she tells her Sarah tried to kill herself over her. Later, Lydia overhears Sarah admit her love to a drunken Zoe. The next day, Lydia begins slitting her wrists and tries to convince Sarah that Zoe is trying to split them up. Lydia uses a knife on one of the parachutes which Zoe will use, however they get mixed up. As the girls head into the sky, Lydia begins to feel guilty and tries to stop them, however Zoe and Sarah jump out. Lydia follows and is horrified when Zoe's parachute deploys and Sarah's does not. Sarah then <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Lydia and Zoe rush to her body, both crying. Lydia frames Zoe for the death of Sarah by hiding the knife used to sabotage the parachute behind Zoe's bed. Lydia then proceeds to slit her wrists in the shower due to her guilt.|$|E

25|$|For {{advanced}} users, {{many of the}} engine's limitations have workarounds. One can approximate gravity's {{effect on}} a monster by defining a heavy diagonal path; the monster will move horizontally until it reaches a ledge, at which point it will fall until it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> again. Similarly, although monsters lack hit counters, the user can create chains of identical (or successively injured-looking) monsters to approximate the same effect.|$|E

Then both gaits end with the {{striking}} off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.|$|E

This time, there was Sam falling off Shelob, where the morph takes place as Astin <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Legolas attacking a mûmak required numerous transitions to and fro, and Gollum's shots of him having recovered the One Ring and falling into the Crack of Doom were fully animated. The King of the Dead is played by an actor in prosthetics, and his head occasionally morphs to a more skull-like digital version, depending on the character's mood. The Mouth of Sauron also had his mouth enlarged 200% for unsettling effect.|$|E
25|$|Depending on location, various safe-haven {{areas have}} been prepared. The goal has been to avoid outer walls which might {{collapse}} when a roof section becomes airborne and the walls below lose their upper support: many interior rooms resist collapse longer, due to smaller walls interconnected to each other, while outer walls deflect {{the force of the}} winds. Because mobile homes typically lack foundation anchors and present a large surface-area sail (to catch wind), the advice has been to seek a safe haven elsewhere, such as in a stronger nearby building. When a mobile home begins to roll, people have been injured by hitting objects inside, or being crushed when a trailer suddenly <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and begins to collapse around them.|$|E
25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have {{a good view of the}} landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.|$|E
