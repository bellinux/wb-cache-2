50|$|Luxating patella {{cannot be}} present without the knee being loose, but a loose knee is not {{necessarily}} slipping out of the joint. Even with luxating patella symptoms such as <b>intermittent</b> <b>limping</b> in the rear leg might be mild or absent. Physical examination and manual manipulation are the preferred methods for diagnosis. More extreme cases can result in severe lameness. Osteoarthritis typically develops secondarily.|$|E
30|$|A 66 -year-old woman {{presented}} with symptoms of lower back pain, weakness and numbness of lower extremities and an <b>intermittent</b> <b>limp.</b> Soon after {{the onset of}} these symptoms, she experienced difficulty walking and was hospitalized. X-ray showed a shadow in the left lung and CEA levels were elevated. She was transferred to a specialist hospital due to possible bone metastasis. BS testing was administered and stage 4 lung cancer with metastasis in the lumbar vertebrae was diagnosed.|$|R
40|$|KÃ¶hler disease (KD) is the {{osteochondrosis}} of the tarsal {{navicular bone}} {{of the young}} children, which is a self-limited condition. Typically the child reports pain with mechanical characteristics in the medial region of the foot, however, <b>intermittent</b> or continuous <b>limping</b> {{may be the only}} clinical manifestation, which delays the diagnosis and consequently exposes to unnecessary tests and treatments. We describe a bilateral KD whose clinical manifestation was unilateral limping with 4 months evolution. The radiologic evaluation showed flattening, sclerosis and irregular rarefaction of both navicular bones. Claudication persisted for four weeks, after which, the child remains asymptomatic. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
