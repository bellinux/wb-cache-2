25|$|As safety precautions, the {{built-in}} fuse for the warhead is released by a safety mechanism. This arms the warhead after a flight distance of approximately five meters. Once armed, the warhead will detonate on impact, {{and as a}} safety when the rocket's propellant runs out. This safeguards against live ammunition staying around and causing hazards to all in the future. The Panzerfaust 3 is distributed in a special package including spare parts and a cleaning kit. The package contains a launcher, ejector and spring, extractor, dummy extractor plug, bolt-head retaining pin, plastic cleaning rod with brass tip, bore and chamber brushes, camel's <b>hair</b> <b>brush</b> and a prismatic bore scope. It takes several minutes to assemble and load the launcher.|$|E
2500|$|All domesticated horses {{benefit from}} having their manes and tails untangled {{regularly}} to remove dirt, tangles and debris. Horses with short manes usually have their manes combed, while horses with longer manes are usually groomed {{with a human}} <b>hair</b> <b>brush</b> or a stiff dandy brush. [...] Horses with extraordinarily long manes may have their manes hand picked to remove tangles.|$|E

No photographs were taken of the scene, nor was evidence such as Morris' purse and <b>hair</b> <b>brush</b> preserved.|$|E

2500|$|Juveniles, 1950. The council {{adopted a}} motion by Don A. Allen asking the Police Department {{what was being}} done to enforce curfew laws. Allen said it was his opinion that if policemen were [...] "equipped with a good old-fashioned <b>hair</b> <b>brush,</b> which {{could be applied to}} some of these kids," [...] there might be a {{lessening}} of juvenile crime. But Roybal disagreed, noting that most of the [...] "hoodlums" [...] were over 21 and recommending closer cooperation by the police with agencies [...] "dealing with youth problems." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thanks. Spike; I'm through, now. You {{might just}} give me a brush down, though, if you don't mind. Not that. That's a <b>hair</b> <b>brush.</b> Try the big black one." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jerry: But {{the thing}} you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked <b>hair</b> <b>brushing,</b> good; naked crouching, bad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you are {{not very}} forward," [...] {{retorted}} Maggie, hastily reaching her own pink cotton gown, and looking at Lucy's light-brown <b>hair</b> <b>brushed</b> back in curly disorder.|$|R
6000|$|Through {{the window}} of the barber shop he saw the [...] "mean man" [...] frantically belaboring the barber with a <b>hair</b> <b>brush,</b> while his hair stood up stiff as bayonets in all directions. And the grocer ran out of his door and yelled [...] "Fire!" [...] while his shoes left a track of {{molasses}} wherever he stepped.|$|E
60|$|The {{individual}} {{riding the}} party wall like an aerial horse was a tall, angular young man, {{with dark hair}} sticking up like a <b>hair</b> <b>brush,</b> intelligent and even distinguished lineaments, but a sallow and almost alien complexion. This showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie, {{the only part of}} his costume of which he seemed to take any care. Perhaps it was a symbol. He took no notice of the girl's alarmed adjuration, but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her, where he might very well have broken his legs.|$|E
6000|$|XIII Yet {{a semblance}} of {{resource}} avails us-- Shade so finely touched, love's sense must seize it. Take these lines, look lovingly and nearly, Lines I write {{the first time and}} the last time. [...] 120 He who works in fresco, steals a <b>hair</b> <b>brush,</b> Curbs the liberal hand, subservient proudly, Cramps his spirit, crowds its all in little, Makes a strange art of an art familiar, Fills his lady's missal-marge with flowerets. He who blows thro' bronze, may breathe thro' silver, Fitly serenade a slumbrous princess. He who writes, may write for once as I do.|$|E

60|$|During {{the week}} Pep met them twice on the Bowery. He was cleanly washed, had his curly <b>hair</b> <b>brushed,</b> {{and wore a}} brand-new suit. In his altered {{appearance}} Richard hardly knew him.|$|R
6000|$|There was a naughty Boy, [...] A naughty boy was he, [...] He {{would not}} stop at home, [...] He could not quiet be-- [...] He took [...] In his Knapsack [...] A Book [...] Full of vowels [...] And a shirt [...] With some towels-- [...] A slight cap [...] For night cap-- [...] A <b>hair</b> <b>brush,</b> [...] Comb ditto, [...] New Stockings [...] For old ones [...] Would split O!

60|$|In vain I {{waited for}} him to start some popular song. His records were only of the best, and the care he took of them was a revelation. He handled each one reverently, as a sacred thing, untying and unwrapping it and {{brushing}} it with a fine camel's <b>hair</b> <b>brush</b> while it revolved and ere he placed the needle on it. For a time all I could see was the huge brute hands of a brute-driver, with skin off the knuckles, that expressed love in their every movement. Each touch on the discs was a caress, and while the record played he hovered over it and dreamed in some heaven of music all his own.|$|E
60|$|He {{was quite}} anxious {{to satisfy the}} {{requirements}} of Benham's people and to do his friend credit. He was still in the phase of being a penitent pig, and he inquired carefully into the needs and duties of a summer guest in a country house. He knew it was quite a considerable country house, and that Sir Godfrey wasn't Benham's father, but like most people, he was persuaded that Lady Marayne had divorced the parental Benham. He arrived dressed very neatly in a brown suit that had only one fault, it had not the remotest suggestion of having been made for him. It fitted his body fairly well, it did annex his body with only a few slight incompatibilities, but it repudiated his hands and face. He had a conspicuously old Gladstone bag and a conspicuously new despatch case, and he had forgotten black ties and dress socks and a <b>hair</b> <b>brush.</b> He arrived in the late afternoon, was met by Benham, in tennis flannels, looking smartened up and a little unfamiliar, and taken off in a spirited dog-cart driven by a typical groom. He met his host and hostess at dinner.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{you must}} take it, mademoiselle," [...] the servant said, sturdily; [...] "but wait a moment, let me take off your bonnet and <b>brush</b> your <b>hair.</b> There is nothing like having your <b>hair</b> <b>brushed</b> when you are tired." ...|$|R
6000|$|FALDER's cell, a {{whitewashed}} space thirteen feet broad {{by seven}} [...] deep, and nine feet high, with a rounded ceiling. The floor is [...] of shiny blackened bricks. The barred window of opaque glass, [...] with a ventilator, is {{high up in}} the middle of the end wall. In [...] the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door. In a [...] corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up [two blankets, two [...] sheets, and a coverlet].

60|$|Mr. Sabin sat quite still. Her <b>hair</b> <b>brushed</b> his cheeks, {{her arms}} were about his neck, her whole {{attitude}} was an invitation for his embrace. But he sat like a figure of stone, neither repulsing nor encouraging her.|$|R
60|$|His eyes became {{confused}} with roused lights, his detached attention {{changed to a}} readiness for her. He {{was a young man}} of twenty-one, with a slender figure and soft brown <b>hair</b> <b>brushed</b> up on the German fashion straight from his brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he says so;" [...] {{and then}} the words between the young ladies became a little more angry. But, nevertheless, in due time they came forth with faces smiling as usual, with their <b>hair</b> <b>brushed,</b> and without any signs of warfare.|$|R

50|$|On 25 August 1887, six {{citizens}} of Triengen found Bürstenfabrik AG Triengen with a share capital of CHF 40,000.

60|$|The nursery of this cottage was {{a little}} bower of a room, papered with mossy-green paper, and curtained with white muslin; and here five little {{children}} used to come, in their white nightgowns, to be dressed and have their <b>hair</b> <b>brushed</b> and curled every morning.|$|R
60|$|The colour had deepened in her thin, oval face, {{with its}} {{straight}} brows, and large, grey eyes. Her <b>hair,</b> <b>brushed</b> in fine, high curves {{back from her}} forehead, was going grey, like his own, and this greyness made the sudden vivid colour in her cheeks painfully pathetic.|$|R
