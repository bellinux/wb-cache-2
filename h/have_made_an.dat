5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E

However, other styles of music such as rap, reggae, and glam rock <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> appearance since the event's expansion.

5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value, would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> excellent choice. From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to be a complete coincidence.|$|E

5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, the Chinese {{had simply}} {{approximated}} {{the value of}} pi as 3, until Liu Xin approximated it at 3.154 sometime between 1–5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians. Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23 CE) also showed approximations for pi at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167. Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the area of a square versus the area of its inscribed circle had an approximate ratio of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 42:32. With D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=9⁄16D3, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio. To fix this, Zhang added 1⁄16D3 to the formula, thus V = 9⁄16D3 + 1⁄16D3 = 5⁄8D3. Since he found {{the ratio of the}} volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the area of a square to the inscribed circle is √8:√5. With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the square root of 10, or 3.162. After the Han, Liu Hui approximated pi as 3.14159, while the mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429–500 CE) approximated pi at 3.141592 (or 355⁄113), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.|$|E
