50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, <b>kosher</b> <b>butchering</b> and {{vivisection}} (animal experimentation) were the main concerns of the German animal welfare movement. The Nazis adopted these concerns as part of their political platform. According to Boria Sax, the Nazis rejected anthropocentric reasons for animal protection—animals were to be protected for their own sake. In 1927, a Nazi representative to the Reichstag called for actions against cruelty to animals and <b>kosher</b> <b>butchering.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the high}} {{position}} given to Muslims, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them severely, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like Circumcision, {{as well as}} <b>Kosher</b> <b>butchering</b> for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Genghis Khan directly called Muslims [...] "slaves". Toward the end, corruption and persecution became so severe that Muslim Generals joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim Generals including Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name which in Chinese means [...] "baracks" [...] or [...] "thanks". Many Hui Muslims claim {{it is because they}} {{played an important role in}} overthrowing the Mongols and in thanks by the Han Chinese.

Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant [...] "barracks" [...] and could also mean [...] "thanks".
