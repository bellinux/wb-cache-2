30|$|Finally, I {{was only}} allocating musicians to a session to <b>fill</b> an <b>{{instrument}}</b> slot if they played the instrument over {{the current and}} previous year. Musicians often play multiple instruments, {{and it makes a}} considerable difference if a musician has played the instrument in question only a decade in the past.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{weighing}} {{plays an}} important part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk weighing, smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and weighed by gravimetric <b>filling</b> <b>instruments,</b> by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often weighed automatically by in-motion road vehicle weighing instruments or automatic rail-weighbridges, respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, weighing of container wagons in cross-border traffic, shovel dozers for weighing building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry. This paper is intended to give a survey {{on the state of the}} art in automatic weighing and on international efforts (eg. OIML) towards harmonization of specifications and test procedures for automatic weighing instruments...|$|R
50|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Instrument Room is the large electrostatic generator built by John Cuthbertson in 1784. This apparatus is the largest flat-plate electrostatic generator {{of the world and}} the oldest piece in the room itself, which is filled mostly with items from the 19th century. Surrounding this centerpiece are 10 numbered cabinets <b>filled</b> with <b>instruments</b> accompanied by numbered cards that can be cross-referenced to a guide located in the room.|$|R
50|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>fills</b> {{a gap in}} {{the market}} for a cheap, durable and {{lightweight}} handbell type instrument. Due to these qualities they have been used preferentially to handbells in schools and with elderly or disabled musicians.|$|R
30|$|This {{work is a}} part of {{a broader}} project that was {{submitted}} and approved by an Ethical Committee. Sample 1 was collected in a pen-and-paper style, in one high school in the southwest of Brazil. Parents of all participants signed an informed consent term before the adolescents <b>filled</b> the <b>instrument.</b> Samples 2 and 3 were collected on line, in a Google Forms platform, and adults and students only accessed the protocol after agreeing with an informed consent term.|$|R
5000|$|Theodore [...] "Steve" [...] Brown (January 13, 1890 - September 15, 1965) was a jazz {{musician}} {{best known for}} his work on string bass. Like many of his fellow New Orleans, Louisiana bassists, he played both string bass and tuba professionally, as the two <b>instruments</b> <b>fill</b> similar roles in different types of bands.|$|R
60|$|Miss Miggs deliberated within {{herself for}} some little time, looking {{hard at the}} shop-door while she did so, as though her eyes and {{thoughts}} were both upon it; and then, taking {{a sheet of paper}} from a drawer, twisted it into a long thin spiral tube. Having <b>filled</b> this <b>instrument</b> with a quantity of small coal-dust from the forge, she approached the door, and dropping on one knee before it, dexterously blew into the keyhole as much of these fine ashes as the lock would hold. When she had filled it to the brim in a very workmanlike and skilful manner, she crept upstairs again, and chuckled as she went.|$|R
50|$|The cartoon {{depicts a}} tribe of cartoon Mickey Mouse-like mice who move and dance through a room <b>filled</b> with musical <b>{{instruments}},</b> while the song It's Got Me Again! plays on a gramophone. When a hungry cat shows up {{and tries to}} eat the mice, most of them escape—but one mouse is trapped. Luckily, he is rescued by the others, who use their musical instruments as weapons against the cat.|$|R
50|$|When {{reading a}} depth scale {{on the side}} of an <b>instrument</b> <b>filled</b> with liquid, such as a water level device, the {{meniscus}} {{must be taken into account}} in order to obtain an accurate measurement. Depth must be measured with the meniscus at eye level (to eliminate parallax error) and at the center of the meniscus, i.e. the top of a convex meniscus or the bottom of a concave meniscus.|$|R
50|$|Gorvy {{also has}} an old violin. A man named Dahl, an {{appraiser}} from Chicago who has a shop <b>filled</b> with musical <b>instruments,</b> examines the violin and says it is somewhat rare and actually worth $25,000. Complications arise when Mickey's plan to steal the instrument is discovered by a small-time ex-con named Randy Kinney, who not only will not leave Mickey alone, but turns violent and bludgeons one of Gorvy's neighbors to death.|$|R
50|$|The song {{starts with}} Latimer {{repeatedly}} playing a ten-second riff {{four times as}} other <b>instruments</b> <b>fill</b> the song. Then comes the first verse, where Peter Bardens sings. There is a short instrumental break, and then comes the second verse, with Bardens singing again. Afterward, {{there is a long}} keyboard solo by Bardens, and then comes the last verse. After the last verse, there is a guitar solo by Latimer until the song fades out.|$|R
30|$|In sum, I was {{generating}} jazz worlds {{where the}} recording company {{was able to}} <b>fill</b> the <b>instrument</b> slots in the session with available and able musicians. These musicians of course might have been {{very different from the}} observed ones. Imagine, for example Miles Davis on trumpet being swapped for a young trumpet player active in London at the time. The most important difference for us, of course, is that the musicians selected by our rewiring were not selected according to their networks. They were not likely to have played with each other in the past, and they were not likely to have been “friends of friends” either. I generated 100 jazz worlds – simulated complete histories of jazz where an observed jazz session had a corresponding rewired version.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{these songs}} were re-recorded, {{there are some}} subtle {{differences}} scattered throughout such as changed lyrics or different <b>instrument</b> <b>fills.</b> Knowing this, a true fan could reasonably argue that this is in fact not a compilation, but a new studio recording, even though the songs had all been recorded and released prior to this album (except for [...] "Something You Ain't Got", which would appear {{a few months later}} in the year on their Greenland release).|$|R
50|$|Bach's sonatas for {{violin and}} obbligato {{harpsichord}} were composed in trio sonata form, i.e. three independent parts {{consisting of two}} equally matched upper voices above a bass line. Instead of {{playing the role of}} a continuo <b>instrument,</b> <b>filling</b> in the harmonies of a figured bass, the harpsichord took one of the upper melodic lines on equal terms with the violin, whilst also providing the bass line (which could be reinforced if desired by the addition of a viola da gamba).|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was African Americans 2 ̆ 7 ethnic {{identity}} development. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate manifestations of oppression affect African American ethnic identity development. The perceptions of locus of responsibility regarding socioeconomic status were investigated as they related to ethnic identity development. Multiple regression was the method of analysis. The predictor variables were socioeconomic status (Revised Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status, self-report of class and income level), and locus of responsibility (Revised Causal Dimensional Scale II). The criteria variable, ethnic identity development, was operationalized as scores obtained on the Black Racial Identity Attitudes Scale. One hundred and seventy five African American participants from churches in the midwest participated by <b>filling</b> out <b>instruments.</b> Results indicated that perceptions of cause of socioeconomic status did not predict level of African American ethnic identity development. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the firm capitalised on work funded by British Rail to develop means of calculating the {{aerodynamic}} behaviour of high-speed trains in long, complex tunnel systems (the resulting methods are still used today to design tunnels for rail traffic). MHA and French firm SETEC were appointed as joint advisers to the British and French Channel Tunnel Companies, who proposed a workable scheme. Exploratory construction contracts were let, but the British Government abandoned the scheme in 1975, {{with the first}} tunnel boring machine (built to dig the service tunnel) literally sitting on its launch frame. Despite the lack of funding, a short section of service tunnel was dug beneath the English coast through ground that had been <b>filled</b> with <b>instruments</b> to assess {{the performance of the}} TBM. This section of service tunnel was incorporated into the successful scheme a decade later.|$|R
40|$|A liquid-helium-cooled far {{infrared}} spectrophotometer was built {{and used to}} make low resolution observations of the continua of several kinds of astronomical objects using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. This <b>instrument</b> <b>fills</b> a gap in both sensitivity to continuum sources and spectral resolution between the broadband photometers with lambda/Delta lambda approximately 1 and spectrometers with lambda/Delta lambda greater than 50. While designed primarily to study planetary nebulae, the instrument permits study of {{the shape of the}} continua of many weak sources which cannot easily be observed with high resolution systems...|$|R
50|$|It {{may be of}} {{interest}} to note that the protein CD spectra used in secondary structure estimation are related to the π to π* orbital absorptions of the amide bonds linking the amino acids. These absorption bands lie partly in the so-called vacuum ultraviolet (wavelengths less than about 200 nm). The wavelength region {{of interest}} is actually inaccessible in air because of the strong absorption of light by oxygen at these wavelengths. In practice these spectra are measured not in vacuum but in an oxygen-free <b>instrument</b> (<b>filled</b> with pure nitrogen gas).|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{critical}} {{responses to}} the album have been positive. New Release Tuesday stated that the album [...] "is at times reminiscent of the more organic Without Words...this sophomore project takes a distinctly new direction, incorporating electronic elements and ethereal vocal layering." [...] AllAboutWorship.com suggests that the [...] "fantastic arrangements" [...] be used [...] "for pre-service music, transitional tunes and ministry music" [...] and lauds [...] "the musicality and creativity of Bethel Music."

40|$|AbstractFrom the {{perspective}} of multigenerational theory, the constructions concerning the family-of-origin are an influencing legacy {{for the development of}} individuals throughout their life-span, including marital relationships. The present study aimed to test a model of causal links between family-of-origin, romantic attachment pattern, and adjustment to marital relationship. In order to measure the variables, 164 married adults <b>filled</b> out four <b>instruments.</b> The results suggest that the individuals’ constructions of family-of-origin predict romantic attachment pattern, while the romantic attachment predicts marital adjustment. Some limitations and implications of the study for clinical practice in family and couple therapy are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|After the band's self-titled sixth album, The Lads {{their focus}} began to shift towards {{a younger age}} group. Their aim, after a few trips to the USA to tour, was to try and break into a larger market by moving to the U.S. in 2005. It was during this time that Chris and Bennett {{decided to leave the}} band and move back to New Zealand. Bjorn's older brother Kristian filled in on bass for early {{performances}} after the move to the U.S. but has not been formerly replaced since his departure. Instead, the band uses loops and backtracks to <b>fill</b> in <b>instruments</b> vacated by former members. Kristian now plays in a new version of Royal Rumble along with Rimu Tahu. Chris continues to have some creative and lyrical input into the band and can be seen on live footage filmed in New Zealand from the [...] "Live at The Thunderdome" [...] DVD. Paul has also had guest slots during performances in the band's home city of Wellington, New Zealand during tours in New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|The video {{consists}} of four settings: the first one shows Keys lying on a chair in an empty room; the second one is a room <b>filled</b> with musical <b>instruments</b> in which Keys sings accompanied by a Roland Jupiter-8 keyboard; in the third one Keys is initially alone, playing the piano on a rainy street, and she later finds herself surrounded with dozens of people; in the fourth and final one Keys is in a blue-lit nightclub.

60|$|Presently {{they reached}} the temple, a single room, {{surrounded}} by a spacious paved area; in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of people. Before the image there were pools of blood, where victims had lately been slaughtered. In the sanctum was Devi, a large black figure with ten arms. With a spear {{in one of her}} right hands she pierced the giant Mahisha; and with one of her left hands she held the tail of a serpent, and the hair of the giant, whose breast the serpent was biting. Her other arms were all raised above her head, and were <b>filled</b> with different <b>instruments</b> of war; against her right leg leaned a lion.|$|R
30|$|Patients {{were invited}} to {{complete}} the QL questionnaires at three points during the treatment and follow-up periods: {{on the first day}} of chemotherapy, 2  weeks after the third cycle, and at the follow-up consultation 6  weeks after the end of the platinum-doublet treatment. Patients did not know the status of their disease (stable or progressing) when completing the second and third assessments. Questionnaires were administered in paper pencil version. Patients <b>filled</b> in the <b>instruments</b> at a desk in the Oncology Departments. A psychologist was present while the questionnaires were being completed. After completing their questionnaires, the patients were able to discuss their answers with the psychologist. Patients did not need help to understand and to reply to the questions.|$|R

His father was a musician his mother’s family built hand-crafted pipe organs as the Latapi Pipe Organ Company in Mexico City. Although their home was <b>filled</b> with musical <b>instruments,</b> they remained largely untouched. At six years old, Palance was drawn to his father’s unused Hammond organ and taught himself to play. At age nine he discovered the guitar and labored for hours becoming proficient {{in a variety of}} musical styles. At fourteen, years before he was legally allowed to enter a bar, he began writing songs and performing with rock bands at clubs on the Sunset Strip and throughout Los Angeles.|$|R
