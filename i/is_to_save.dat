Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, whose goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the Wisps, an alien race {{that has been}} enslaved by Doctor Eggman.

Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.|$|E
5|$|The player {{touches the}} screen to move Adam Jensen, a protagonist from the stealth combat, cyber-dystopian Deus Ex series, between nodes on a {{hexagonal}} grid towards an exit. If moved to a specific node, the character will stealthily take down guards, hack computers, and activate his human augmentations, such as invisibility. Enemies who spot Jensen will move towards and, if they reach his node, eliminate him. Alternatively, Jensen can eliminate enemies if approached from behind or their side. In the game's story, which is set before the events of , Jensen's sole mission <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> an important person, but is continually set back by puzzles—54 in total.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach {{continue}} {{to uncover the}} conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, {{in which he has}} been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to New Frontiersman, a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then leave New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent, but Veidt has already enacted his plan.|$|E

25|$|Total depravity is {{the fallen}} state of {{man as a}} result of {{original}} sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and philanthropy are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in Reformed theology, if God <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> anyone He must predestine, call, elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, indeed is incapable of choosing God.|$|E

In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> his wife's life. The story is continued in the 3D tie-in comic Superman Beyond, where the female Monitor Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him {{and several of his}} multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising care for Lois. After defeating the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brings back a distilled drop of The Bleed and administers it to Lois through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois is later seen in Final Crisis #6, one of the few still free humans.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge has a nasty {{temper and}} rarely hesitates to use cartoon {{violence}} {{against those who}} provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, {{he seems to be}} against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.|$|E

500|$|The episode's opening {{is set on}} December 26, 2004, {{over three}} months after the crash of Oceanic 815. Most of the episode takes place on the {{freighter}} [...] "Kahana," [...] moored offshore of the island where the plane crashed. The freighter is owned by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who is intent on extracting the Others' leader Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Captain Gault (Grant Bowler) stops two crewmembers from deserting the freighter in a raft. He publicly beats them and shouts that this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> their lives, reminding the crew of what happened to George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) when he left the boat. The next morning, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) confronts Michael about his motivations, and the narrative shifts into an uninterrupted flashback of Michael's life after escaping from the island.|$|E

Capaldi's Doctor addresses this in the episode [...] "The Girl Who Died," [...] when the Doctor finally remembers that he shares a face with a man he was persuaded to save in Pompeii, despite his initial reluctance to alter that timeline. He surmises that he subconsciously chose this face for his current regeneration {{as a reminder that}} his job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> lives. [...] Capaldi also played John Frobisher throughout , the third series in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, although no similar connection has been made on-screen to this character.|$|E
500|$|Druckmann views The Last of Us as {{a coming}} of age story, in which Ellie adapts to {{survival}} after spending time with Joel, {{as well as an}} exploration of how willing a father <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> his child. A major motif of the game is that [...] "life goes on"; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to [...] "reignite [...] lust for life", after her suffering following her encounter with David. The Infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection.|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} Joel's physical appearance, {{the team}} {{tried to make}} him look [...] "flexible enough" [...] to allow for him to appear as both a [...] "ruthless operator in the underground of a quarantined city" [...] as well as a [...] "caring father figure to Ellie". His appearance was aimed to evoke [...] "rural Americana", referencing values of self-reliance and ingenuity when facing hardship and deprivation. When writing the character of Joel, Druckmann initially took inspiration from Josh Brolin's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men (2007), which he saw as [...] "very quiet, very cool under pressure". However, Baker's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the character in a different way. Ultimately, the narrative became an exploration of how willing a father <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> a child; initially, Joel is willing to sacrifice himself, before evolving where he is willing to sacrifice his friends, until finally feeling that he would sacrifice all of humanity in order to save Ellie.|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{foreword}} to John Marriott's book, Thunderbirds Are Go!, Anderson {{put forward}} several {{explanations for the}} series' enduring popularity: it [...] "contains elements that appeal to most children– danger, jeopardy and destruction. But because International Rescue's mission <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> life, there is no gratuitous violence." [...] According to Anderson, Thunderbirds incorporates a [...] "strong family atmosphere, where Dad reigns supreme". Both O'Brien and script editor Alan Pattillo have praised the series' positive [...] "family values". In addition, Heffer and others have written of its cross-generational appeal. In 2000, shortly before the series' BBC revival, Brian Viner remarked in Radio Times that Thunderbirds was {{on the point of}} [...] "captivating yet another generation of viewers". Stuart Hood, writing for The Spectator in 1965, praised Thunderbirds as a [...] "modern fairy tale"; adding that it [...] "can sometimes be frightening", he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents. Writing for Dreamwatch in 1994, Andrew Thomas described Thunderbirds as only [...] "nominally" [...] a children's programme: [...] "Its themes are universal and speak as much to the adult in the child as the child in the adult." ...|$|E
