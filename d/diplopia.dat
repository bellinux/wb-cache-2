5|$|Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) {{can also}} result in <b>diplopia.</b> This {{is due to}} {{impairment}} in the lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducens nerve.|$|E
5|$|Vision: {{different}} {{drugs as}} well as optic compensatory systems and prisms {{can be used to}} improve the symptoms of nystagmus or <b>diplopia</b> (double vision). Surgery can also be used in some cases.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} <b>diplopia</b> with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move {{downwards}} properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (<b>diplopia)</b> and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or <b>diplopia),</b> fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, <b>diplopia,</b> discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (<b>diplopia)</b> will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diplopia</b> (double vision) is common.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diplopia</b> (double vision), {{produced}} by a reduced eye convergence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diplopia</b> (Double vision) or uneven {{pupil size}} may be {{symptoms}} if related pressure causes a third and/or sixth nerve palsy.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} {{acquired}} strabismus with double vision (<b>diplopia),</b> it is long-established {{state of the}} art to aim at curing the double vision {{and at the same time}} recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had <b>diplopia</b> due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including vision therapy and strabismus surgery, may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurological}} {{manifestations of}} BYS were first described by Yoshinari et al. including patients with peripheral neuritis, meningitis and cranial neuritis (facial nerve palsy, <b>diplopia</b> and deafness).|$|E
25|$|Typically, episodic ataxia {{presents}} as {{bouts of}} ataxia induced by startle, stress, or exertion. Some patients also have continuous tremors of various motor groups, known as myokymia. Other patients have nystagmus, vertigo, tinnitus, <b>diplopia</b> or seizures.|$|E
25|$|To {{initially}} relieve double vision (<b>diplopia)</b> {{caused by}} an extra-ocular muscle palsy, an eye care professional may recommend using an eyepatch. This can help to relieve the dizziness, vertigo and nausea {{that are associated with}} this form of double vision.|$|E
25|$|Sleepiness (12.5%), {{headache}} (3.8%), dizziness (3.8%), nervousness (2.7%), depression (2.5%), memory disturbances (2.3%), <b>diplopia</b> (2.2%), aggression (2.0%), ataxia (1.9%), vertigo (1.9%), hyperactivity (1.8%), {{vision loss}} (1.6%) (See below), confusion (1.4%), insomnia (1.3%), impaired concentration (1.2%), personality issues (1.1%). Out of 299 children, 33 (11%) became hyperactive.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{strabismus}} findings is large angle exotropias {{which can be}} treated by maximal bilateral eye surgery, but due to the progressive nature of the disease, strabismus may recur. Those that have <b>diplopia</b> as a result of asymmetric ophthalmoplegia maybe corrected with prisms or with surgery to create a better alignment of the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Common (1–10% of patients): blurred vision, <b>diplopia,</b> {{increased}} {{appetite and}} subsequent weight gain, euphoria, confusion, vivid dreams, changes in libido (increase or decrease), irritability, ataxia, attention changes, feeling high, abnormal coordination, memory impairment, tremors, dysarthria, parasthesia, vertigo, dry mouth and constipation, vomiting and flatulence, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, peripheral edema, feeling {{the effects of}} drunkenness, abnormal walking, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, increased creatine kinase level.|$|E
25|$|Following {{an acute}} {{overdose}} of a benzodiazepine {{the onset of}} symptoms is typically rapid with most developing symptoms within 4 hours. Patients initially present with mild to moderate impairment of central nervous system function. Initial signs and symptoms include intoxication, somnolence, <b>diplopia,</b> impaired balance, impaired motor function, anterograde amnesia, ataxia, and slurred speech. Most patients with pure benzodiazepine overdose will usually only exhibit these mild CNS symptoms. Paradoxical reactions such as anxiety, delirium, combativeness, hallucinations, and aggression can also occur following benzodiazepine overdose. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have also been occasionally reported.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can occur}} during the aura {{phase of a}} {{migraine}} attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. Micropsia, along with hemianopsia, quadrantopsia, scotoma, phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, <b>diplopia,</b> dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, {{is a type of}} aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache. The symptom usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the migraine headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with migraine headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as micropsia are most common in children with migraines.|$|E
25|$|Episodic ataxia type-3 (EA3) {{is similar}} to EA1 but often also {{presents}} with tinnitus and vertigo. Patients typically present with bouts of ataxia lasting less than 30 minutes and occurring once or twice daily. During attacks, they also have vertigo, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus and <b>diplopia.</b> These attacks are sometimes accompanied by headaches and precipitated by stress, fatigue, movement and arousal after sleep. Attacks generally begin in early childhood and last throughout the patients' lifetime. Acetazolamide administration has proved successful in some patients. As EA3 is extremely rare, there is currently no known causative gene. The locus for this disorder has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42).|$|E
25|$|The most renowned case of regained {{stereopsis}} {{is that of}} neuroscientist Susan R. Barry, who had had alternating infantile esotropia with <b>diplopia,</b> but no amblyopia, underwent three surgical corrections {{in childhood}} without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after vision therapy with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist Oliver Sacks. Also David H. Hubel, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case. In 2009, Barry published a book Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions, reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{red-headed}} krait is {{an extremely}} venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles {{are the first to}} suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or her eyelids open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include <b>diplopia,</b> dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed κ-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.|$|E

2500|$|Orbital dermoid cysts are benign [...] {{which are}} {{typically}} {{found at the}} junction of sutures, most commonly at the fronto-zygomatic suture. Large deep orbital dermoid cysts can cause pressure effects on the muscles and optic nerve, leading to <b>diplopia</b> and loss of vision.|$|E
2500|$|Dysmetropsia in one eye, {{a case of}} aniseikonia, {{can present}} with {{symptoms}} such as headaches, asthenopia, reading difficulties, depth perception problems, or double vision. The visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images. [...] Without suppression {{of one of the}} images symptoms from mild poor stereopsis, binocular <b>diplopia</b> and intolerable rivalry can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Eye {{patching}} {{is used in}} the orthoptic {{management of}} children at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia), especially strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. [...] These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid <b>diplopia,</b> resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform “near activities” (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.|$|E
2500|$|In {{about two-thirds}} of individuals, the initial symptom of MG {{is related to the}} muscles around the eye. There may be eyelid {{drooping}} (ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris) and double vision (<b>diplopia,</b> due to weakness of the extraocular muscles). Eye symptoms tend to get worse when watching television, reading, or driving, particularly in bright conditions. Consequently, some affected individuals choose to wear sunglasses. The term [...] "ocular myasthenia gravis" [...] describes a subtype of MG where muscle weakness is confined to the eyes, i.e. extraocular muscles, levator palpebrae superioris, and orbicularis oculi. Typically, this subtype evolves into generalized MG, usually after a few years.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{conditions}} {{are known to}} be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small. In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function. One of these studies, published in 2003, explicitly concluded: [...] "We found that improvement in binocularity, including stereopsis, can be obtained in a substantial portion of adults." [...] That article was published together with a discussion of the results among peers in which the scientific and social implications of the medical treatment were addressed, for example concerning the long-term relevancy of stereopsis, the importance of avoiding <b>diplopia,</b> the necessity of predictable outcomes, and psychosocial and socioeconomic relevance.|$|E

50|$|Surgical {{intervention}} may {{be required}} to prevent <b>diplopia</b> and exophthalmos. Patients that are not experiencing enophthalmos or <b>diplopia,</b> and that have good extraocular mobility can be closely followed by ophthalmology without surgery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diplopia</b> {{can also}} occur when viewing {{with only one}} eye; this is called monocular <b>diplopia,</b> or, where the patient {{perceives}} more than two images, monocular polyopia. While there rarely may be serious causes behind monocular <b>diplopia</b> symptoms, this is much less often the case than with binocular <b>diplopia.</b> The differential diagnosis of multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as corneal surface keratoconus, subluxation of the lens, a structural defect within the eye, a lesion in the anterior visual cortex or non-organic conditions, however diffraction-based (rather than geometrical) optical models have shown that common optical conditions, especially astigmatism, can also produce this symptom.|$|E
50|$|If <b>diplopia</b> {{turns out}} to be intractable, it can be managed as last resort by {{obscuring}} part of the patient's field of view. This approach is outlined in the article on <b>diplopia</b> occurring in association with a condition called horror fusionis.|$|E
50|$|Patients with {{cranial nerve}} IV palsy whose {{complaints}} are not specifically limited to torsional <b>diplopia,</b> but instead also have significant vertical <b>diplopia,</b> {{are not good}} candidates for a Harada-Ito procedure. Instead, a recession of the inferior oblique muscle, or another strabismus operation may be indicated.|$|E
